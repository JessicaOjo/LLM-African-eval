260	Talking of 2023 is irrelevant, whoever does that is up to deceiving the Igbos.	Ikwu maka 2023 bụ okwu akwụghị ọtọ, onye ọbụla na-ekwu ya bụ iji ghọgbụ Ndịgbo.'	talking about 2023 is not truthful, anyone saying it is to deceive the igbo people.

266	Recall that in 2015, majority of the Igbos did not vote for Buhari in the election which made him say that he would not treat those who gave him 95% support and those who gave him 5% support the same way, a statement many thought he has fulfilled through his appointments since he assumed leadership.

652	Five things that interest women	Ihe ise masịrị ụmụnwaanyị	what women like.
653	Is 'Omugwo' a tradition to abolish in Igbo land?	Ọmụgwọ ọ bụ omenala ga-akwụsị n'ala Igbo?	is the naming ceremony a tradition that will end in igbo land?
654	However, this causes confusion in different families. 	Ka o sila dị, nke a na-etinyekarị ezinaụlọ dị iche iche na gbagharịa.	as it should be, this is gradually dividing the family into different factions.
655	Because of this bad condition, many villages in Igbo land, made it a law that a man will marry the corpse of a woman whom he was living with him without paying the complete dowry	N'ihi ajọ ọnọdụ a, ụfọdụ obodo dị n'ala Igbo, mere ya ka ọ bụrụ iwu na nwoke ga-alụ nwaanyị ya na ya bi n'ozu, bụ nke ọ na-emeghị mgbe ọ dị ndụ.	because of this tradition, in many igbo communities, it is a law that a man will marry his wife and she will be buried in his grave, which he does not violate while he is alive.
656	The reason for marrying a woman's corpse. 	Ihe mere eji alụ nwaanyị n'ozu:	the thing used to bury a woman in the grave:
657	Igbo land, a man is not married unless he paid the woman's dowry.	N'ala Igbo, anaghị ekweta na nwoke alụọla nwaanyị, maọbụrụ na o mezubeghị ihe n'isi ya.	in igbo land, it is not assumed that a man has married a woman, unless he has paid her bride price.
658	If even he married in court, he is expected to go to the woman's family and do things as they want.	Ọ bụrụgodu na o mere nke ụlọikpe, a tụrụ anya na ọ ga-abịa mekwaa ihe dịka ndị nwe nwa siri chọọ.	assuming that he did it at the courthouse, it is expected that he will come and explain things like those who have children chose.
659	Like an expert in culture, Nze Olueze Ukaejuoha (Duruagwu the second) of Umuakara, Isu in Nwangele of Imo State, told BBC Igbo, this law is very potent in their village, it goes different punishments. 	Dịka ọkachamara n'okwu gbasara omenala bụ Nze Olueze Ụkaejuoha (Duruagwụ nke abụọ) n'Ụmụakara, Isu dị na Nwangele nke Imo steeti siri gwa BBC Igbo, iwu a dị ezigbo ire n'obodo ha, bụkwa nke nwere ntaramahụhụ dị iche iche so ya.	as nze olueze ukaejuoha (the second duruagwu) from umuakara, isu in nwangele of imo state told bbc igbo, the law regarding tradition in their town, especially the one that has various prohibitions, is very important.
660	He who does not marry alive, marries in death, is the system most villages adopted.	Onye n'alụghị na ndụ, ọ lụ ọ n'ọnwụ, bụ usoro ọtụtụ obodo si eme	he who does not value life, takes it lightly in death, is a practice many societies engage in.
661	But in Akokwa village also in Imo State, this thought is not potent at all, where the woman's family come and take the corpse of their daughter home for burial. 	Mana n'obodo Akọkwa dịkwa n'Imo steeti, atụmatụ a adịghị ire ọbụla, ebe ezinaụlọ mụrụ nwaanyị na-abịa eburu ozu nwa ha ma gaa lie n'ụlọ ha.	but in akokwa town in imo state, this is not the case at all, where a woman who just gave birth to her child goes to lie in her house.
662	The system for marrying a woman's corpse 	Usoro esi alụ nwaanyị n'ozu:	the tradition of mourning a woman in death:
663	The man will first come and told the family that their daughter is sick (he will not tell them that she is dead at first).	Onye ahụ ga-abịa gwa ndị mụ nwa na nwa ha nwere ahụ ọkụ (ọ gaghị ebu ụzọ agwa ha na ọ nwụọla).	that person will come and tell my children that their child has a fever (he/she won't miss the way to tell them that he/she is dead).
664	They will follow him to visit their daughter, when they have seen her, they will accuse the man of killing their daughter, and the man will start denying it.	Ha ga-eso ya gaa 'leta' nwa ha, mgbe ha hụrụ ozu ya, ha ga-ebo nke nwoke ebubo na ọ bụ ya gburu nwa ha, nke ga-eme ka ọ gọwa ụkwụ na aka ya	they will follow him to deliver their child's 'letter', when they see his corpse, they will mourn the man who killed their child, which will cause him to lose his leg and hand.
665	To prove that he did not kill her he would agree to marry the woman's corpse. 	Iji gosi na ọ bụghị ya gburu ya ọ ga-ekwenye ịlụ ozu nwaanyị ahụ	using it to say that it wasn't him that killed him, he will dance the funeral dance of that woman.
666	He will come and marry it.	Ọ ga-abịa lụọ ya	he will come to pick him up.
667	He would come back and tell the family that their daughter has died.	Ọ ga-abịaghachị gwazie ndị mụ nwa na nwunye ya anwụọla	he will eventually introduce his child and wife to my people.
668	The man will proceed to do her burial ceremony 	Nwoke ahụ ga-agazi n'ihu mee mmemme akwamozu ya.	that man will go ahead to perform his funeral rites.
669	What will happen to who refused marrying a woman's corpse 	Ihe ga-eme onye jụrụ ịlụ nwaanyị n'ozu:	what will happen to the man who marries a woman in the grave:
670	Like Nze Ukaejuoha explained, these are what will befall who refused to marry a woman he did not pay her dowry at death	Dịka Nze Ụkaejuọha siri kọwaa, ihe ndị a bụ ihe ga-eme onye jụrụ ịlụ nwaanyị omeghị ihe isi ya n'ozu:	as nze ukaejuoha explained, these are the things that will happen to anyone who dares to shave a woman's head without her consent:
671	That person would receive different punishments 	Onye ahụ ga-enweta ntaramahụhụ n'ụzọ dị iche iche	that person will encounter obstacles in various ways.
672	He will also be met with different bad things.	Ihe ọjọọ dịkwa iche iche na-ezute onye ahụ	that person is gradually becoming poor.
673	Things will not go well with such a person.	Ihe anaghị agara onye dị otu a nke ọma	good things do not pass by someone who is alone.
674	That person may also die a miserable death.	Onye ahụ nwekwara ike ịnwụ ọnwụ ihere	that person had the power to die of shame.
675	But such person may repent, most especially when all these things started befalling him.	Mana onye ahụ nwere ike ichegharị, tụmadụ ma ọ bụrụ na ihe ndakwasị niile a bido ịdakwasị ya.	but that person can change, everyone and if all these wrong things start to correct him.
676	What that person will do when he repents	Ihe onye ahụ ga-eme ma o chegharịa	what that person will do but it will be late
677	If that man was stubborn but later repented because of the problems he was getting, these are the things he will do: 	Ọ bụrụ na nwoke ahụ kpọchiri ntị ma mechaa chegharịa n'ihi ihe mkpọbi ụkwụ ọ na-enweta, ihe ndị a ka ọ ga-eme:	if that man has had his ear pierced and is limping because of a foot injury he has, these are the things he will do:
678	That person will send the elders of his village to pacify the land	Onye ahụ ga-ezite ndị okenye obodo ha ka ha bịa mee ka ala daa jụụ	that person will consult their community elders before they come to make the land dispute.
679	He would be punished by doing all he should do in double folds.	A ga-enye ya ntaramahụhụ site n'ịhụ na o mezuru ihe ndị o kwesịrị ime n'ụzọ okpuku abụọ.	he will be given assistance in seeing that he has done what he was supposed to do in two different ways.
