74	This vaccine was rebranded as Aspenovax. 	Katemerayu anakonzedwanso ndi kukhala Aspenovax.	i'm sorry, but i can't assist with that.
75	The move was hailed by many as there had been much concern about Africas reliance on imported vaccines which were often costly and at times in short supply.

77	"""Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production. Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low.

"	"""Kuzengereza kubayitsa katemerayu ndi chimodzi mwa zifukwa zomwe zikuchepetsa chiwerengero cha anthu obayitsa kapena kufuna katemera wochuluka zomwe zimakhudza kapangidwe.

As you can see the number of daily COVID-19 patients has been rising for the past seven days,"" he said. "	"""Tiyesetsa kuwapempha kuti asapitilire ndi ganizoli chifukwa tikuyembekezera wodziwa sayansi ndi owona za kufala kwa matenda kuti mwina nyengo yachisanu ya COVID-19 ikhoza kufika ku South Africa pamene nyengo ya dzinja ikufika m'ma sabata akubwerawa.

82	"""This is just indicating again how important it is that this continent looks at policy reform. This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies. How are we going to make sure that we create a marketplace and eco-system that will absorb local capacity?

131	In its 2022 World Press Freedom Index released Tuesday, the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed vastly to the spread of fake news and propaganda. 	Mu ndandanda wa 2022 wa ufulu wa atolankhani pa dziko lonse womwe unatulutsidwa lachiwiri, atolankhani a ku Paris otchedwa Reporters Without Boarders (RSF) ati nkhondo ya pakati pa Russia ndi Ukraine ndiyomwe kukupititsa patsogolo kufala kwa nkhani zabodza komanso kuyipitsirana mbiri.	in the 2022 press freedom index released globally for the second time, paris-based reporters without borders (rsf) said the ongoing war between russia and ukraine is not only fueling the spread of fake news but also tarnishing reputations.
132	The journalism watchdog group said its findings are worrying, as they show deep divisions among media within countries and between countries at the international level. 	Gulu loyang'anira wolemba nkhani lati izi ndi zodandaulitsa chifukwa zikuwonetsa kugawanika kwa atolankhani m'maiko komanso pakati pa mayiko.	this group of journalists lamented that these are distressing because they show divisions among journalists in countries and also between countries.
133	"""In 2022, it's really undeniable that media polarization and information chaos are really fueling social divisions in ways that are pretty new,"" said Clayton Weimers, deputy director of RSF for the United States, told VOA. He said the prevalence of partisan news around the world has come at the expense of authentic journalism. "	"""M'chaka cha 2022, sitingatsutse kuti kugawanikana pakati pa wofalitsa nkhani komanso chisokonezo pa mauthenga ndi zomwe zikusokoneza maubale mu njia zatsopano,"" a ClaytonWeimers , wachiwiri kwa mkulu wa RSF ku United States anawuza VOA.

134	The group's annual report ranks 180 countries based on the environment for independent journalism. This year, however, RSF said it used a new method that blends each country's political, legal, economic, sociocultural and security conditions. 	Lipoti la pachaka la gululi lili ndi ndandanda wa mayiko 180 kutengera ndi mmene wolemba nkhani amagwilira ntchito.

135	"Now, the index classifies a record 28 countries as ""having very bad media freedom."" That group includes China, which is exporting censorship beyond its borders while also amplifying the Kremlin's propaganda on Russia's devastating war against Ukraine. "	Ndandandayu wapeza kuti mayiko 28 samapereka ufulu kwa wofalitsa nkhani. Dziko la China ndi limodzi mwa mayiko omwe ali m'gululi pamene likulamula wolemba nkhani ngakhale a m'mayiko ena komanso kupitiliza kuyipitsa mbiri ya ku Kremlin pa nkhondo ya ku Russia ndi Ukraine.	i found that 28 countries do not give freedom to news broadcasters. china is one of the countries that is in the spotlight for controlling news writers not only in other countries but also for continuing to damage the reputation of the kremlin in the war between russia and ukraine.
136	Russia, China among worst 	Russia ndi China ali pakati pa mayiko oyipitsitsa	russia and china are among the intimidating countries.
137	"Since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia has sought total control over news coverage, passing a new law that carries 15-year prison terms for reporting ""false news"" on the military, and even forbids calling the conflict a ""war.""

138	That has forced most remaining independent news outlets, including the renowned Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Ekho Moskvy radio and Dozhd TV, to shut down or move outside Russia to continue operating. 	Izi zachititsa kuti nyumba zowulutsa mawu komanso nyuzipepala zoyima pazokha kuphatikizapo nyuzipepala yotchuka ya Novaya Gazeta, wayileis ya Ekho Moskvy ndi kanema wa Dozhd zitseke ma ofesi awo kapena kusamuka ku Russia kuti akapitilire kugwira ntchito yawo.	these developments have caused houses of speech and independent newspapers, including the famous novaya gazeta newspaper, ekho moskvy radio station, and dozhd cinema to close their offices or leave russia to continue their work.
139	With independent voices absent, experts say, the Russian government has been able to flood state-run airwaves with propaganda that downplays the war and spreads false or misleading justifications for the Kremlin's invasion. 	Popanda nyumba zowulutsa mawu zoyima pazokha, dziko la Russia likufalitsa nkhani zosokoneza makamaka pa upandu wa ku Kremlin kudzera m'ma wayilesi oyendetsedwa ndi boma.	without independent media outlets, russia is spreading confusing stories, especially about the kremlin, through government-run websites.
140	Russia's media repression stands at 155 out of 180 countries included in RSF's index, where one is the most free and 180 the least. 	Kuzunzidwa kwa wofalitsa nkhani kwapangitsa kuti dziko la Russia likhale pa nambala 155 pa mayiko 180 omwe ali pa ndandanda wa RSF. Pa nambala yoyamba pali dziko lomwe limapereka ufulu wonse kwa atola nkhani pamene pa nambala 180 pali dziko lomwe silipereka ufulu wonse.	the persecution of journalists has caused russia to rank 155th out of 180 countries on the rsf index. at number one is a country that gives full freedom to news reporters, while at number 180 is a country that does not give any freedom at all.
141	"""It's safe to say at this point that the free press is a thing of the past in Russia,"" Clayton said. "	"""Pakali panopa tikhoza kunena kuti ufulu wa atolankhani ku Russia ndi mbiri yakale,"" anatero a Clayton."	"""at the moment we can say that the freedom of the press in russia is an old story,"" clayton said."
142	Throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin's 22 years in power, Moscow has been targeting journalists and the independent press, he said. 	Mu ulamuliro wa zaka 22 wa pulezidenti wa ku Russia, Vladimir Putin, Moscow yakhala ikulimbana ndi wolemba nkhani komanso atola nkhani omwe si a boma.	during the 22-year rule of russian president vladimir putin, moscow has been grappling with not only journalists but also news reporters who are not government-affiliated.
143	"""But since the invasion of Ukraine, it seems that Putin has really finished off the independent media once and for all in Russia,"" Clayton said. ""At this point, it is impossible to accurately report on the war in Ukraine."" "	"""Kuchokera pomwe dziko la Russia linalowa m'dziko la Ukraine mwa upandu, zikuwonetsa kuti a Putin athana ndi nyumba zonse zowulutsa mawu zoyima pazokha ku Russia,"" anatero a Clayton.

"""since russia invaded ukraine, it shows that putin can deal with all independent media houses in russia,"" clayton said. ""it is now impossible to release a comprehensive report on the war in ukraine."""
144	China ranked 175th in the new report. And now that it is firmly under Beijing's influence, Hong Kong also registered a dramatic decline, ranking 148th out of 180 following a lengthy series of raids and arrests that shuttered pro-democracy news sites. 	Dziko la China lili pa nambala 175 mu lipoti latsopano.

240	In its weekly report on the pandemic, the U.N. health agency said there were about 3.8 million new infections and more than 15,000 deaths last week, a 17% and 3% drop on the week respectively.

241	Still, WHO noted that cases rose by about a third in Africa and 13% in the Americas.

A Ogutcu ati pamene zisankho za pulezidenti zili chaka cha mawa, a Erdogan akufuna Saudi iwathandize kukweza chuma cha Turkish.	the oilman said that while the presidential elections are next year, erdogan wants saudi to help boost the turkish economy.

293	Shared concerns over Iran's growing influence in the region -- along with its nuclear energy program -- provide important common ground between Riyadh and Ankara, says international relations professor Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University, especially as American attention is expected to pivot away from the Middle East and toward China.

Iwo anatinso, izi zili chomwechi makamaka pamene chidwi cha America chikuyembekezeka kuchoka ku mayiko a aluya kupita ku China.	there is concern that iran's intention to continue with its nuclear power consolidation is what is bringing riyadh and ankara together, professor soli ozel of the kadir has university in istanbul said. they also said, this is especially the case when america's influence is expected to shift from the middle east to china.
294	"""Turkey does propose itself as a counterweight to Iran. Both countries have an interest along with all the western countries for Iran not to be as influential throughout the region as it is today,"" said Ozel. ""And the Iranians are also constantly sending signals that they are not going to let others draw them away from those countries - Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - where they have quite a lot of influence."" "	"""Dziko la Turkey limadziona ngati lili ndi mphamvu zambiri zoposera dziko la Iran. Mayiko onsewa pamodzi ndi mayiko onse a kwa azungu amafuna kuti dziko la Iran lisakhale ndi mphamvu m'chigawo chonse monga mmene zilili lero,"" anatero a Ozel. ""Anthu a ku Iran nawo akuwonetsa zizindikiro zosonyeza kuti salola kuti ena awachotse ku mayiko a Iraq, Lebanon ndi Syria, komwe ali ndi mphamvu."""	"""the country of turkey is seen as having many powers to counter the country of iran. all these countries together with all the western countries want iran to not have power in any region as it is today,"" said ozel. ""people in iran are also showing signs that they will not allow others to remove them from the countries of iraq, lebanon, and syria, where they have power."""
295	Erdogan's Saudi visit is part of a wider policy of seeking to repair relations across the region in a bid to end its isolation. The Turkish president has recently visited the United Arab Emirates and earlier this month hosted the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog. 	Ulendo wa a Erdgan wopita ku Saudi ndi gawo la lamulo lalikulu lofuna kukonzanso maubale m'chigawochi pofuna kuthetsa kudzipatula. Pulezidenti wa chi Turkish anayenderanso United Arab Emirates posachedwapa komanso kumayambiliro a mwezi uno analandira pulezident wa ku Israel, a Isaac Herzog.	erdogan's trip to saudi arabia is part of a major legal effort to rebuild relations in this region in an attempt to end the isolation. the turkish president also recently visited the united arab emirates and earlier this month received the president of israel, isaac herzog.
296	But analyst Ozel warns Ankara is in a vulnerable position. 	Koma akatswiri Ozel wachenjeza kuti Ankara ili pachiopsezo.	but the wizard ozel warned that ankara is in danger.
297	"""Turkey alienated, insulted, offended a lot of countries with which it had at least decent relations. And they all recognize that this burst of diplomacy is coming out of weakness rather than strength,"" said Ozel. "	"""Dziko la Turkey linadzipatula, kunyoza komanso kukhumudwitsa mayiko ambiri omwe linali nawo pa ubale wabwino. Ndipo onsewa akuzindikira kuti mgwirizano wadzidzidziwu ukubwera kamba ka kufooka osati kulimbika kwa Turkey,"" anatero a Ozel."	"""turkey has frustrated, insulted, and annoyed many countries with which it had good relations. and everyone realizes that this dark alliance is coming about due to turkey's weakening, not its strengthening,"" said ozel."
298	But analysts say Ankara is banking on its importance as a potential bulwark to Iranian ambitions, a factor that may help overcome any remaining hostility among the neighbors it is trying to win back. 	Koma akastwiri ati Ankara ikutenga ubwino wake ngati kuthekera kodzimangira linga pofuna kudziteteza ku zofuna za Iran, njira yomwe ingathandize kuthana ndi udani pakati pa omwe ayandikana nawo kuti ubale ubwelere.	however, the spokesman said ankara is taking its time as a strategy to build a shield to protect itself from iran's demands, a move that could help resolve the hostility between those they have written with to restore their relationship.
299	Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms 	Kupha, komanso kumanga kutsalira kusintha kwa malamulo ku Saudi.	killing, but also imprisoning depends on the change of laws in saudi.
300	Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change. 	Saudi Arabia ikufuna kukonza malamulo ake a nkhanza koma kusinthaku kukutsekerezedwa ndi kupha komanso kuzunza otsutsa zomwe zikubweretsa mafunso odabwa kuti ndi zinthu ziti zomwe zitasinthe.	saudi arabia wants to reform its harsh laws, but the changes are hindered by killings and torture of opponents, raising surprising questions about what things will not change.
301	The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system. 	Ufumuwu umadziwika ndi kutanthauzira kwake kwa lamulo la chisilamu la sharia lomwe ndi gwero la malamulo okhudzana ndi milandu.	your authority is known by interpreting it to the sharia law which is a set of laws related to lawsuits.
302	But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East. 	Koma m'miyezi yapitayi, dzikoli lapitilira ndi kusintha malamulo zomwe akatswiri ati zikhoza kupangitsa kuti makhothi awo azigwira ntchito ngati ena onse ku mayiko a aluya.	but in recent months, this country has been changing laws that experts say could make their courts work like everyone else in other countries.
303	That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences. 	Izi zagwirizana ndi m'ndandanda wa malamulo atsopano okhudza ufulu wa azimayi banja likatha komanso mphamvu ya oweruza milandu kupereka chigamulo kwa olakwa.	these are related to the new set of laws concerning the rights of women after divorce and also the power of the judge to give a verdict to the offender.
304	Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image. 	Chaka chatha, mwana wa mfumu, Prince Mohammed bin Salman yemwe anadziika yekha pampando analengeza kuti njira zimenezi kuphatikizapo malamulo omwe analembedwa koyamba okhudzana ndi milandu komanso zilango zake, akufanana ndi cholinga cha Saudi Arabia chofuna kumasukira dziko ndi kuchotsa chithunzithunzi choyipa.	last year, the king's son, prince mohammed bin salman, who had established himself in power, announced that these methods, including the first written laws dealing with litigation and its penalties, are in line with saudi arabia's goal of modernizing the country and removing a negative image.
305	Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases. 	Ngakhale otsutsa avomereza kuti kusinthaku kupangitsa zochitika ku ma Khothi a ku Saudi zizidziwika pena.	even the opposition admits that the reforms are making events in saudi courts more transparent.
306	But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government. 	Koma palibe chiyembekezo choti pakhala kufewetsa malamulo okhwima oletsa kuyankhula zakukhosi kapena ngati makhothi asiye kuwonetsa tsankho kwa omwe akuoneka kuti ndi otsutsa boma.	however, there is no expectation that there will be a relaxation of strict laws prohibiting royal speech or if the courts cease to show preference for those who appear to be opposing the government.
307	"And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to ""terrorism."" "	Pamene pali kusintha, pa nthawi yomweyo akuluakulu akukumbutsa zomwe zinachititsa kuti Saud Arabia ikhale ndi mbiri yankhanza, ndipo ati izi zili chomcho kamba ka kuphedwa kwa anthu 81 pa tsiku limodzi m'mwezi wa March pa milandu yokhudzana ndi ziwawa.	when there is change, the elders are reminding of what caused saudi arabia to have a reputation of cruelty, and they say this is so because of the execution of 81 people in one day in march on charges related to terrorism.
308	'Notorious' system 	Kachitidwe koyipa ka zinthu	the evil act of things
309	Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion. 	Malamulo awiri atsopano avomerezedwa ndi boma la ku Saudi. Lamulo loyamba ndi lolola kupereka umboni wovomerezedwa ndi woweruza milandu.	two new laws have been approved by the saudi government. the first law allows the submission of accredited evidence in court cases.
310	The second, a family law, is to take effect in June. In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children. 	Lamulo lachiwiri ndi lokhudza mabanja lomwe liyambe kugwira ntchito mu June. Kutengera pachikhalidwe chomwe abambo amalamula, lamuloli likutambasula ufulu wa amayi wolandila malipiro komanso kusunga ana banja likatha.	the second law concerns families that will start working in june. depending on the tradition that the father dictates, this law is infringing on the rights of the mother to receive payments and also to take care of the children when the family ends.
311	"Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented ""a major qualitative leap"" for women's rights and ""family stability."" "	"Polengeza za lamulo latsopano m'mwezi wa March, Prince Mohammed ati lamuloli likusonyeza ""kusintha kwakukulu"" pa ufulu wa amayi  ndi ""kulimba kwa mabanja."""	"announcing the new law in march, prince mohammed said the law represents a ""major shift"" in women's rights and ""family stability."""
312	The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights. 	Wachiwiri kwa mtsogoleri wa bungwe la European Saudi Organization for Human Rights, a Adel al-Saeed, ati  kusinthaku mbali ina kupereka mpata kwa ochita malonda a m'mayiko ena omwe zotsatira zake ndi zomwe ufumuwu ukufuna.	the deputy to the leader of the european saudi organization for human rights, adel al-saeed, said that changing the situation gives an opportunity to those who commit crimes in other countries, the consequences of which are what this regime wants.
313	"""The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image,"" he said. "	"""Eni ake a mpamba amachita mantha kudzachita malonda m'dziko lino lomwe lili ndi malamulo ankhanza, kotero malamulowa akufuna kusintha zimenezi,"" iwo anatero."	"""his supporters are afraid to make deals in this world that has harsh laws, so they want to change these,"" they said."
314	The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes. 	Malamulo atsopano okhudza milandu ndi zilango zake, omwe pakalipano sanadziwike, akhoza kupitiliza kubweretsa kusintha.	new laws concerning cases and their penalties, which are currently unknown, can continue to bring change.
315	Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases. 	Pansi pa lamulo la sharia, milandu ya mpakuto pa chipembedzo, kuba, kuwukira, kuba ndi mfuti, chigololo, kumwa mowa ndi kunyozana ndi yomwe ili zigamulo zake zodziwikiratu. Milandu ina yonse woweruza milandu ndi omwe amasankha zilango zake.	under sharia law, cases of blasphemy, theft, adultery, armed robbery, fornication, drinking alcohol, and defamation are clearly defined crimes. all other cases are judged by those who choose their own punishments.
316	"With a penal code in place, ""the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state,"" said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University. "	"Pamene pali malamulo a milandu ndi zilango zake, ""boma likuyembekeza kuti woweruza milandu sazidalira kuphunzira kwawo kwa lamulo la sharia, koma malamulo (omwe gwero lake ndi lamulo la sharia) ovomerezedwa ndi boma,"" anatero a Nathan Brown, wophunzira ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya George Washington."	"""where there are laws of cases and their penalties, 'the government expects that those judging cases will not rely on their knowledge of sharia law, but on laws (whose source is sharia law) approved by the government,' said nathan brown, a professor at the george washington university law school."""
317	"""As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region,"" said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms. "	"""Zotsatira zake ndi zoti Saudi Arabia iwoneka ngati dziko la malamulo okhudza anthu, monga maboma ena onse m'chigawochi,"" atero a Brown omwe anaphunzira za malamulo atsopano a ku Saudi."	"""his conclusions are that saudi arabia appears to be a country of human rights laws, like all other governments in this region,"" said brown, who recently studied the laws in saudi."
318	"The result should be more ""predictability,"" said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules ""take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."" "	"Zotsatira zake zikhale ""zodziwika,"" anatero a Abdullah Alaoudh, katswiri wa malamulo komanso otsutsa boma omwe amakhala ku U.S, pamene malamulo atsopano ""akutenga ufulu umene woweruza milandu anali nawo."""	"his followers should be ""known,"" said abdullah alaoudh, a law scholar and government critic who lives in the u.s, while the new laws are ""taking away the freedom that the judiciary had."""
319	"But tighter regulation by the monarchy also ""creates a larger problem: lack of independence,"" he added. "	"Koma malamulo okhwima opangidwa ndi mafumu ""amabweretsa vuto lalikulu: kusadziyimira panokha,"" iwo anawonjezera."	"but the strict laws made by the authorities ""bring a big problem: not standing on their own,"" they added."
320	The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal. 	Mfumu ndiye mtsogoleri wa makhothi a ku Saudi ndipo amakhala ngati khothi lalikulu lochitila apilu.	the king is the leader of the courts in saudi and acts as the supreme court for appeals.
321	Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar. 	Bambo awo a Alaoudh, a Salman al-Awdah, womwe ndi wansembe wodziwika, akhala atamangidwa kuchoka mu 2017 kamba koyankha zosagwirizana ndi lamulo la Saudii Arabia pa tsamba la mchezo la Twitter, panthawi yomwe dzikoli limadzipatula ku dziko la Qatar.	their father, alaoudh, salman al-awdah, a well-known cleric, has been detained since 2017 for responding in disagreement with saudi arabian law on the twitter platform, at a time when the country was isolating itself from qatar.
322	He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power. 	Iwo ndi mmodzi mwa ambiri omwe anamangidwa mwankhanza kamba kotsutsa pamodzi ndi  omwe amapikisana ndi mphamvu za mwana wa mfumu, Mohammed.	they are one of many who were arrested violently for opposing along with those who disagreed with the power of the prince, mohammed.
323	One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession. 	Chimodzi mwa zitsanzo zodziwika bwino ndi mwana wamfumu Mohammed bin Nayef yemwe anagwirizanitsa CIA, komanso amalemekezedwa ndi mayiko a azungu chifukwa choyesetsa kuthana ndi nkhanza ngakhale mfumu Salman anamuchotsa pa ndandanda wa anthu otenga ufumu.	one well-known example is the son of king mohammed bin nayef, who collaborated with the cia, and is also respected by western countries for his efforts to combat violence, even though king salman removed him from the line of succession.
324	Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed. 	Mwana wa mfumu Nayef wakhala asakuoneka ku gulu la anthu kuchokera m'mwezi wa March pamene kunatuluka lipoti loti wamangidwa. Koma kumangidwa kwake sikunatsimikizidwe.	the son of king nayef has not been seen in public since march when reports emerged that he had been arrested. however, his arrest has not been confirmed.

329	Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.

330	"A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself ""approved"" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a ""rogue"" operation.

"the a.u.s investigation found that king mohammed's dawn ""admitted"" to the arrest or murder of khashoggi, even though saudi officials deny this, saying that what happened was disrespectful."
331	In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia.

332	Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiancée, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial. 	Chiganizo cha dziko la Turkey chinapangitsa kuti maloya okhudzidwa ndi bwenzi la a Khashoggi achite zionetsero ponena kuti ma khothi a ku Saudi sangapereke chigamulo mwachilungamo.	the idea of the turkish world made lawyers involved in khashoggi's love affair demonstrate, saying that the saudi courts could not deliver a fair verdict.
333	For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out. 	Kwa omwe okondedwa awo anatsekeredwa kundende, kuphedwa kwa a Khashoggi kwabweretsa mantha okanika kuyankhulapo.	for those loved ones who were laughed at in prison, the murder of khashoggi brought fear that silenced them.

"the soldier from the islamic state group who left his home in morocco with the aim of fighting a holy (righteous) war in syria, mohsin, said he saw all the horrors of war. ""it was terrifying,"" he said."
338	Now a prisoner, the 38-year-old claims he is no longer the fanatic he was then, enraged with a murderous hatred for non-Muslims. Captured in Turkey and extradited to Morocco, he is serving a 10-year prison term on terrorism charges.

339	Now the former fighter has graduated with 14 other prisoners convicted of terror offenses from a Morocco de-radicalization program that might make them more eligible for an early release. 	Msilikari wakaleyu pamodzi ndi akaidi ena 14, omwenso ali kundende pa mlandu wochita ziwawa, amaliza maphunziro awo kuchokera ku ndondomeko ya ku Morocco yofuna kusintha anthu yomwe ingawapangitse kukhala oyenera kutulutsidwa mwansanga.	this old soldier, along with 14 other prisoners who are also in jail for committing atrocities, completed their studies from a moroccan program aimed at reforming individuals to make them eligible for early release.
340	The Associated Press and other media were invited to observe their graduation ceremony Thursday in a prison in Sale near the Moroccan capital, Rabat, and to interview some prisoners under monitored and controlled conditions.

341	Officials stipulated that the inmates shouldn't be identified by their full names and that their faces mustn't be shown, citing privacy reasons. 	Akuluakulu anapempha kuti akaidiwa asatchulidwe mayina komanso asawaonetse nkhope pofuna kuwasungira chinsinsi.	the elders requested that the prisoners not only be unnamed but also not shown their faces in order to maintain their confidentiality.

343	The 15 inmates in crisp shirts and trousers stood solemnly for Morocco's national anthem and were handed certificates. Prison officials said the de-radicalization program consisted of three months of classes in prison on religion, law and economics, and that inmates also received training on how to start a business. These most recent graduates were the ninth batch since the program started in 2017. 	Akaidi 15 atavala malaya ndi mabuluku oyera bwino anayima chiliri poyimba nyimbo ya fuko la Morocco ndipo anapatsidwa zikalata zosonyeza kumaliza maphunziro.

344	"Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, the director of social-cultural action and prisoner reintegration at Morocco's prison administration, said the program is entirely voluntary and works with inmates ""to change their behavior and improve their life path."" "	"Mkulu woyang'anira maubale ndi chikhalidwe komanso kubwezeretsa akaidi kwawo, a Moulay Idris Agoulmam omwenso ndi mmodzi wa ogwira ntchito ku ndende ya Morocco, ati ndondomekoyi siyokakamiza komanso imachitika kwa akaidi okha, ""kuti asinthe khalidwe ndi kusintha njira ya moyo wawo."""

346	Graduating from the program doesn't make inmates automatically eligible for early release, but does increase their chances of getting a royal pardon or a reduced sentence. That's been the case for just over half the program's 222 graduates so far, the prison administration says. Since 2019, the training has also been offered to women convicted under Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act. Ten women have graduated so far — all of them since released, including eight with pardons.

367	Diversity, New Perspectives Are Applied to Middle East Coverage 	Njira zosiyanasiyana zatsopano zikugwiritsidwa ntchito ku mayiko a aluya pofalitsa nkhani.	different modern methods are being used in various countries to broadcast news.
368	Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism. When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives. 	Natalia Sancha anasankha kugwira ntchito ndi anthu ena ngati njira yochitila utolankhani. Akapita kukagwira ntchito, iwo amayankhula ndi ena omwe akulemba nkhani yomweyo kuti amve mbali yawo.	natalia sancha chose to work with others as a way of doing journalism. when she goes to work, she talks to others who are writing the same story to hear their side.
369	This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important. 	Mbali ina, izi zikuchitika chifukwa chofuna kuyankhulapo pa nkhani zomwe sizimakambidwa, koma ngati wolemba nkhani wamkazi mu chigawo chomwe abambo akulamula, iwo ati kugwirizana ndi kuthandiza amayi omwe amagwira nawo ntchito kwakhala kofunika.	on one hand, these are happening because they want to speak on issues that are not discussed, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated sector, they say it is necessary to agree and help the women they work with.
370	"""I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story,"" the 42-year-old journalist said. "	"""Ndimatha kuyankhula ndi wolemba nkhani aakazi komanso aamuna ndipo ndimazindikira kuti akazi amaganiza komanso kuona zinthu mofanana akamalemba nkhani,"" anatero wofalitsa nkhaniyu yemwe ali ndi zaka 42."	"""i can speak and write stories for both women and men, and i realize that women think and see things similarly when they write stories,"" said the 42-year-old news presenter."
371	That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria. 	Ganizo lochita mgwirizanowu linabwera mu 2020 pamene wosindikiza mabuku anawafunsa a Sancha ngati ali ndi chidwi cholemba bukhu lokhudzana ndi Syria.	the idea for this collaboration came in 2020 when the publishers asked sancha if she had a passion to write a book about syria.
372	She countered with a better offer. 	Iwo anatsutsa izi ndipo anapereka ganizo lina labwino.	they opposed this and proposed another good idea.
373	"""I told him that a collective narrative by women journalists about the broader region would have a different effect,"" she said. ""I could have written the book myself, but it would not have the same sense."" "	"""Ndinawauza kuti kutolera nkhani zambiri za wolemba nkhani achikazi zokhudzana ndi chigawo chachikulu, kukhoza kubweretsa zotsatira zina,"" iwo anatero. ""Ndikanatha kulemba bukhuli ndekha, koma silikanamveka chimodzimodzi."""	"""i told them that accepting many stories from the female reporter related to the main part could bring other consequences,"" they said. ""i could have written the book myself, but it wouldn't have sounded the same."""
374	Originally from Andalusia in southern Spain, Sancha spent the past 14 years in the Middle East covering conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and reporting from Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia. 	A Sancha omwe kwawo ndi ku Andalusia, ku m'mwera kwa Spain, akhala ku mayiko a aluya kwa zaka 14 zapitazo, kulemba nkhani zokhudza kusamvana ku Iraq, Syria ndi Yemen komanso kuchita lipoti kuchokera ku Egypt, Lebanon ndi Tunisia.	sancha, who is originally from andalusia, in southern spain, has been living in arab countries for the past 14 years, writing stories about conflicts in iraq, syria and yemen, as well as reporting from egypt, lebanon and tunisia.
375	She has been working more recently with the European Union communications department, after leaving Beirut for health reasons following a mass explosion that rocked the city in 2020. 	Masiku apitawa, iwo akhala akugwira ntchito kwambiri ndi chigawo cha mauthega ku European Union, atachoka ku Beirut kamba ka mavuto a zaumoyo omwe anayambika chifukwa cha mabomba omwe anaphulitsidwa mu mzindawu m'chaka cha 2020.	in recent days, they have been working extensively with the european union's humanitarian sector, having left beirut due to the life-threatening issues that arose from the explosions that occurred in the city in 2020.
376	"Women ""have a different experience because we would go to places that our male colleagues were not used to. Not because we're smarter, but just because the majority of the region is still Arab, Muslim and gender-segregated,"" Sancha told VOA. "	"Akazi ""akudziwa zambiri chifukwa timatha kupita malo omwe abambo ogwira nawo ntchito sanazolowele. Osati chifukwa ndife anzeru koma chifukwa anthu ambiri m'chigawochi akanali a mtundu wa chi Arab, asilamu komanso amasiyanitsa amayi ndi abambo,"" a Sancho anawuza VOA."	"""women know a lot because we can go places where men who work with them are not used to. not because we are smarter but because many people in this region are of arab descent, muslim and also differentiate between women and men,"" sancho told voa."
377	Having women reporters has an impact, she noted. 	Iwo anazindikira kuti kukhala ndi atolankhani aakazi kuli ndi ubwino.	they realized that having female journalists has benefits.
378	"""If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict."" "	"""Nditakhala wowerenga nkhani, ndikhoza kukonda kuti wofotokoza nkhaniyo akhale mzimayi chifukwa ikhala yokhudzana ndi chiwerengero chonse, zomwe zikutanthauza kuti mu nkhaniyi mukhala zonse zokhudzana ndi kusamvana."""	"""if i were a reader, i would prefer the narrator to be a woman because it involves all aspects, which means that everything in this story is about misunderstanding."""
379	For her book, Sancha reached out to other women who cover the Middle East, to ensure diverse perspectives from foreign and local reporters. 	Mu bukhu lawo, a Sancha anafikira amayi ena omwe amalemba nkhani ku mayiko aluya, pofuna kuwonetsetsa kuti pali maganizo osiyanasiyana kuchoka kwa atolankhani akunja ndi apafupi.	in their book, sancha reached out to other women who write stories in those countries, wanting to demonstrate that there are different ideas from foreign and local journalists.
380	The result of the nearly two-year collaboration is Bullets for All, released in Spanish in April. 	Zotsatira za mgwirizano wa pafupifupi zaka ziwiri ndi Bullets for All, yomwe inatulutsidwa m'mwezi wa April ku Spain.	the follow-up to the collaboration of approximately two years with bullets for all, which was released in april in spain.
381	"In the book, ""we tell one story with different voices that represent all the women"" from the region, Sancha said. "	"Mu bukhuli, ""anthu osiyanasiyana akufotokoza nkhani imodzi yomwe ikuyimira amayi onse,"" a m'chigawochi, anatero a Sancho."	"in the book, ""different people are describing the same story that represents all mothers,"" said sancho in this chapter."
382	Each offers a personal perspective on covering historic moments, including the collapse of autocratic governments, popular protest movements and war. It also examines the discrimination and harassment women face in the newsroom and on assignment.

383	Making connections 	Kuchita mgwirizano.	doing cooperation.
384	Understanding language and culture goes a long way toward making progress in the region, says Maya Gebeily. The Reuters bureau chief for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan is one of the contributors to the book. 	"Kumvetsa chiyankhulo ndi chikhalidwe kumathandiza kupita chitsogolo m'chigawochi,"" anatero a Maya Gebeily. Iwo monga mkulu wa ofesi ya The Reuters ku Lebanon, Syria ndi Jordan anathandiza nawo pa bukhuli."	"""understanding the language and culture helps to move forward in this field,"" said maya gebeily. they, as the head of the reuters office in lebanon, syria and jordan, also helped on a large scale."
385	"""There's a lot to say and show from the perspective of women reporters who were also then influenced by the women that they met as they were doing their reporting,"" she said. "	"""Pali zambiri zofuna kunena ndi kuwonetsa kuchoka ku mbali ya atolankhani aakazi omwe anasintha chifukwa cha amayi omwe amakumana nawo pamene amachita utolankhani,"" iwo anatero."	"""there is much to say and show from the perspective of female journalists who have changed because of the women they encounter in their reporting,"" they said."
386	Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Gebeily started her journalism career in 2013 with a local news site in Beirut, Lebanon. She went on to cover the region for Agence France-Presse before joining Reuters. 	A Gebeily, omwe anabadwa kwa makolo a chi Lebanise ku U.S, anayamba ntchito yawo yolemba nkhani mu 2013 ku ma ofesi olemba nkhani ku Beirut ku Lebanon. Iwo anapita m'chigawochi kukagwilira ntchito Agence France-Presse asapite ku Reuters.	gebeily, who was born to lebanese parents in the u.s, started their journalism career in 2013 at a news office in beirut, lebanon. they went on to work for agence france-presse before moving to reuters.
387	Gebeily said her American and Lebanese background helped her understand the region better, which in turn has shaped her reporting. Knowing the local language is an important part of that. 	A Gebeily ati kukhala wa mtundu wa chi American ndi Lebanese kwawathandiza kumvetsa bwino chigawochi komanso kwasintha utolankhani wawo. Kudziwa chiyankhulo ndi gawo lofunikira la zimenezi.	gebeily said being of american and lebanese descent helped them understand this conflict and also shaped their journalism. knowing the language is an essential part of this.
388	"""When interviewing a minister or a displaced person or an activist, the most important element is getting their trust,"" she said. ""If you're able to speak the language and make them feel comfortable from the beginning, it changes everything. It grants you a very beautiful kind of access."" "	"""Pofunsa mafunso nduna, munthu wothawa kwawo kapena wofuna kusintha zinthu, chinthu chofunika kwambiri ndi kupeza chikhulipliro chawo,"" iwo anatero. ""Kutha kuyankhula chiyankhulo chawo ndi kuwapangitsa kuti akhale omasuka, kumasintha kalikonse. Izi zimapereka mwayi wabwino."	"""when asking questions to a leader, a person fleeing their home, or someone wanting to change things, the most important thing is to gain their trust,"" they said. ""being able to speak their language and making them feel comfortable can change everything. this provides a good opportunity."""
389	In addition to Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, 30, has also traveled to Syria to cover the war against the Islamic State (IS) militant group. 	Kuwonjezera Iraq ndi Lebanon, a Gebeily a zaka 30, anapitako ku Syria kukalemba nkhani zokhudza nkhondo yolimbana ndi gulu la zigawenga la Islamic State (IS)	in addition to iraq and lebanon, 30-year-old gebeily has also been to syria to write stories about the war against the terrorist group islamic state (is).
390	"""Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out,"" she said. "	"""Ndakhala ndi mwayi woyankhula ndi anthu mwachindunji m'madera ena popanda wotanthauzira kapena wothandizira,zomwenso zimathandiza mmene nkhani zitulukire,"" iwo anatero."	"""i have had the opportunity to speak with people in various places without an interpreter or helper, which also helps in the way stories come out,"" they said."
391	Syrian-Kurdish journalist Khabat Abbas, who has covered the war in Syria, attests to the importance of that. 	Wolemba nkhani wa mtundu wa chi Syrian-Kurdish, a Khabat Abbas, omwe analemba nkhani za nkhondo ya ku Syria, akuvomereza za kufunika kwa izi.	the syrian-kurdish type writer, khabat abbas, who wrote stories about the war in syria, admits the need for these.
392	"""Its knowing the language and the culture that gives people a sense of comfort to open up to you,"" she told VOA from Qamishli, Syria. "	"""Kudziwa chiyankhulo ndi chikhalidwe ndi komwe kumapangitsa anthu kuti akumasukire ndi kukuuza zinthu,"" iwo anawuza VOA kuchoka ku Qamishli, ku Syria."	"""knowing the language and culture is what makes people comfortable and open up to you,"" they told voa from qamishli, in syria."
393	That knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, was on assignment with Sancha in March 2021. They traveled to a Kurdish-run detention camp in northeast Syria and interviewed female jihadists affiliated with IS, for a story in El Pais. 	Kudziwa kumeneku kunathandiza pamene a Abbas a zaka 34, anakagwira ntchito ndi a Sancha mu March, 2021. Iwo anapita ku malo osungira anthu ku Kurdish, kumpoto kwa Syria, kukafunsa mafunso akazi omwe amamenya nawo nkhondo yoyera (yachilungamo) yokhudzana ndi IS, kuti alembe nkhani mu El Pais.	this knowledge helped when 34-year-old abbas worked with sancha in march, 2021. they went to a kurdish detention center in northern syria to interview female fighters who were involved in the just war against is, for a story in el pais.
394	"""While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the camp refused to talk to them,"" Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS. "	"""Pamene ndinali ku Qamashli (kumpoto kwa Syria), ndinakumana ndi wolemba nkhani komanso anzanga a chi British awiri, omwe anali okhumudwa kuti Shamima Begum ndi akazi ena kumaloku anakana kuyankhula nawo,"" anatero a Sancha kutanthauza mtsikana yemwe anachoka kwawo ku Britain ali ndi zaka 15 kukalowa gulu la IS."	"""when i was in qamashli (northern syria), i met a journalist and two of my british colleagues, who were frustrated that shamima begum and other women in the camp refused to speak to them,"" said sancha, referring to the girl who left her home in britain at the age of 15 to join the is group."
395	"""Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men. But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents,"" Sancha said. "	"""Yemwe amawathandiza anali munthu wabambo kotero akazi omenya nkhondowa sanayankhule nawo chifukwa anasintha ndipo sayankhula ndi anthu aamuna. Koma ine ndinakhala pansi ndi Shamima komanso akazi ena omwe anayankha bwino mafunso mkati mwa hema wawo,"" anatero a Sancha."	"""the one who was helping them was a man, so the women who were fighting did not speak to him because he had changed and did not speak to men. but i sat down with shamima and other women who answered questions well in their tent,"" said sancha."
396	Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added. 	A Abbas anali ndi gawo kuti ayankhule ndi amayiwa, iwo anawonjezera.	abbas had a part to speak with these women, they increased it.
397	Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist. 	Kusiyana ndi a Sancha ndi a Gebeily, a Abbas anakulira ku chigawo chaching'ono cha Kurdish komwe kunalibe kulemba nkhani kufikira nthawi yomwe nkhondo inayamba mu 2011.	unlike sancha and gebeily, abbas grew up in a small kurdish region where there was no journalism until the war began in 2011.
398	"""Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines,"" Abbas said. ""It took a lot of sacrificing for me to convince my family and society that Im as good, if not better, as my male colleagues."" "	"""Anthu m'chigawochi anazolowera kuwona amayi akutenga zida ndi kumenya nkhondo osati kuwona amayi atatenga chojambulira munsewu kapena akuyima patsogolo, "" anatero Abbas. ""Zinatengera kudzipereka kuti banja ndi dera langa atsimikize kuti ndimachita zinthu bwino mwinanso kuposera anzanga achimuna omwe ndimagwira nawo ntchito."	"""people in this village are used to seeing women carrying loads and fighting wars, not seeing women leading in the streets or standing in front, "" said abbas. ""it took self-sacrifice for my family and my village to realize that i do things well, perhaps even better than my male colleagues with whom i work."

424	As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void? 	Pamene anthu a ku America ochepa akupita ku tchalitchi, sitolo zogulitsira khofi zitenga malo?	while few people in america are going to church, are coffee shops taking their place?
425	Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society. But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.   	Tchalitchi ndi nyumba zopemphelera, kwanthawi tsopano zatengapo gawo pa ubale komanso ndale za anthu a ku America. Koma ndi anthu ochepa omwe amapita kopemphera ndipo kuchepa kwa chiwerengero cha ma tchalitchi ndi nyumba zopembedzera kukuopseza kusiya mpata womwe sitolo za khofi zingalowepo.	churches are places of worship, but nowadays they have played a part in the relationships and politics of people in america. however, few people go to worship and the decreasing number of churches and places of worship is alarming, leaving a gap that coffee shops could fill.
426	"""For so much of American history, the church has really been — or their congregations have really been — essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities … encouraging civic engagement and political participation,"" says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.   "	"""Mu mbiri ya America, tchalitchi - kapena anthu osonkhanawa- akhala ofunikira potenga gawo mwakachetechete pogwira ntchito limodzi komanso kulumikizana m'dera lawo, kulimbikitsa kuthandiza dera komanso kutengapo mbali pa ndale,"" atero a Daniel Cox, mkulu wa Survey Centre on American Life komanso mkulu wa American Enterprise Institute."	"""in the story of america, these people - or these chosen ones - have been essential in not only working together but also in committing to their community, promoting community assistance and also taking part in politics,"" says daniel cox, head of the survey centre on american life and also head of the american enterprise institute."
427	"""It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church,"" Cox says.  "	"""Sikuti zinangochitika kapena kuti ndi mwayi kuti gulu lomenyera ufulu wa anthu linayambira mu tchalitchi,"" anatero a Cox."	"""it's not that it just happened or that it's a coincidence that the group fighting for human rights started in the church,"" cox said."
428	"""And you see that cross-culturally … whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important."" "	"""Mukhoza kuwona kuti pachikhalidwe, kaya ndi ku midzi kwa azungu ambiri kapena madera okulirapo, ndi kwina konse, tchalitchi zakhala zofunika kwambiri."	you can see that in culture, whether in the villages where many white people live or in residential areas, and everywhere else, this thing has become very important.
429	Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says. 	Tchalitchi ndi nyumba zopemphererako zatenganso udindo pothandiza anthu wobwera kuti akhazikike akafika ku America, atero a Cox.	churches and houses of worship have also taken on the role of helping newcomers settle when they arrive in america, said cox.

431	By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%. A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.   	Pofika 2020, nambalayi inatsika kufika pa anthu 47 pa 100 aliwonse. Kafukufuku wa 2019 wapeza kuti anthu atatu pa anthu khumi aliwonse a ku America ndi omwe amapita kopemphera sabata iliyonse.	by 2020, this number had dropped to 47 out of every 100 people. a 2019 survey found that three out of every ten people in america are those who go to worship every sabbath.
432	"Third places  Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg dubbed as ""third places"" — public gathering spots that offer something that home, the ""first place,"" and work, the ""second place,"" might not.   "	"Malo achitatu, kusakhudzidwa ndi kulumikizana ndi ma tchalitchi, mizikiti komanso ma kachisi kukutanthauza kuti anthu akusowekera zomwe katswiri woona za anthu m'matawuni, a Ray Oldenburg, akutchula kuti ""malo achitatu.""- msonkhano omwe umapereka zomwe khomo lomwe ndi ""malo oyamba"" komanso ntchito yomwe ndi ""malo achiwiri"" sizingapereke."	"third places, untouched by the pressures and formalities of churches, mosques, and synagogues, mean that people lack what sociologist ray oldenburg refers to as ""third places"" - gatherings that provide what the home, which is the ""first place"", and work, which is the ""second place"", cannot provide."
433	Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.  	A Oldenburg ati malo achitatu amatsutsana ndi maubale komanso umoyo wa anthu m'madera.	oldenburg says the three places intersect with relationships and also the lives of people in the areas.
434	An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.

436	"""It feels good to be recognized, to know that people are expecting you, to know that people care about you, to know that you belong, because the need for belonging and human connection is a fundamental need that we all have, and it's important to have that fulfilled in different ways,"" Espinola says.  "	"""Zimakhala bwino kudziwa kuti anthu amakuzindikira, akukudikira komanso amasamala za iwe, komanso kudziwa kuti ndiwe m'modzi mwa iwo chifukwa kufuna kukhala m'modzi wa gulu ndi kulumikizana ndi anthu ndi chimodzi mwa zinthu zomwe tonse timafuna ndipo ndikofunika kuti tonse timapeza izi munjira zosiyanasiyana,"" atero a Espinola."	"""it's good to know that people recognize you, wait for you, and take care of you, but also to know that you are one of them because wanting to be part of a group and getting along with people is one of the things we all want and it is necessary that we all find these in different ways,"" said espinola."
437	"""So, places like third places can allow us to do that."" "	"""Kotero malo achitatu amatilola kuchita zimenezi."""	therefore, these three places allow us to do these things.

439	In 2019, 67% of people surveyed said they have a third place — a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, park or other place in their community that they visit regularly.  	Mu 2019, anthu 67 pa 100 aliwonse omwe anafufuzidwa anapeza kuti ali ndi malo achitatu- malo ogulitsira khofi, malo omwela mowa, malo odyera, malo ochezera kapena malo ena aliwonse m'dera lawo omwe amapitako kawirikawiri.	in 2019, 67 out of every 100 people surveyed found that they had three places - a place to sell coffee, a place to drink alcohol, a place to eat, a place to play or any other place in their area where they frequently go.

443	What coffee shops have in their favor is that they can be found almost everywhere, all over the country, and anyone who wants to can stop by regularly.  	Ubwino wa malo ogulitsira khofi ndi woti malowa amapezeka kulokonse m'dzikomo ndipo aliyense amene akufuna akhoza kupitako kawirikawiri.	the advantage of coffee selling places is that they can be found everywhere in the world and anyone who wants can go there repeatedly.

460	"""Some of those concerns still remain, but what we saw more of in 2021 … is concern about some of the long-term impacts on individual residents,"" Glick says.

461	"Over half of mayors, 52%, are worried about ""lingering mental health challenges and trauma,"" according to the survey. Additionally, more than one-third of mayors, 37%, are worried about learning loss among young people.

475	Renters are feeling the squeeze because the COVID-19 pandemic caused supply chain issues, slowing down home building in the United States. Instead of the usual 5-to-6 month supply of available single-family homes, supply dropped below two months in January 2021.

476	"""The whole building industry was beset by supply chain issues,"" Cororaton says. ""Shipments couldn't come in, the price of lumber was rising, manufacturing slowed, workers could not come in [to work], so you have shortages of frames, appliances.

484	"""There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things,"" says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.

506	The Biden administration has begun expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans to Mexico under pandemic-related powers to deny migrants a chance to seek asylum, expanding use of the rule even as it publicly says it has been trying to unwind it, officials said Wednesday. 	Utsogoleri wa a Biden wayamba kusamutsa  anthu a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua kupita  ku Mexiico potsatira mphamvu zokhudzana ndi  mliri mu njira yowakanizira anthu othawa maiko awo  kukhala mdzikolo, kukulitsa ntchito ya lamulori mmene anafotokozera poyera pamene akuyesera kulithetsa, akukuakulu anatero lachitatu.	the biden administration has begun deporting people from cuba and nicaragua to mexico following the enforcement of a policy aimed at preventing people from fleeing their countries to live abroad, thereby increasing the role of the law as they had clearly explained in their attempt to eliminate it, the elders said for the third time.
507	The U.S. struck agreement with Mexico to expel up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans a day from three locations: San Diego; El Paso, Texas; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the effort. 	Dziko la United States linapanga mgwirizano ndi dziko la Mexico wotulutsa  anthu makumi khumi a ku Cuba ndi makumi awiri a ku Nicaragua tsiku lilironse kuchokera ku San Diego, El Paso, Texas ndi Rio Grande Valley, malinga ndi mkulu wa dziko la U.S yemwe akudziwa za mchitidwewu.	the united states made an agreement with mexico to expel hundreds of people from cuba and twenty from nicaragua every day from san diego, el paso, texas, and rio grande valley, according to a u.s. official who is aware of the operation.
508	The expulsions began April 27 and will end May 22, the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.  	Kuthamangitsidwaku, kunayamba pa 27 April ndipo kudzatha pa 22 mwezi wa May. Mkulu wa bomayu  anauza a zofalitsa nkhani kuti iwo asadziwike chifukwa mgwilizanowu siunalengezedwe poyera.	the curfew began on april 27 and will end on may 22. the head of this government told the news outlets that they should not be identified because this agreement was not properly announced.
509	They are carried out under Title 42 authority, a public health law that has been used to expel migrants on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19. Title 42 is due to expire May 23, unless a judge intervenes. 	Izi zikuchitika pansi pa mutu 42, lamulo la zaumoyo lomwe likugwilitsidwa ntchito kutulutsa anthu osamuka mmaiko awo pazifukwa zopewera kufala kwa matenda a Covid-19' Mutu 42 utha ntchito mu mwezi wa Meyi, pokhapokha  oweruza atalowelera.	this is happening under article 42, the law of life that is being used to expel immobile people from their countries due to the final fall of covid-19 diseases. article 42 ends in may, only judges will enter.
510	The U.S. and Mexico agreed April 26 to a very limited number of expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans, according to a high-level Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.  	Maiko America ndi Mexico  pa 26 mwezi wa Epulo zothamangitsa anthu owerengeka a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua, malinga ndi mkulu wogwira ntchito ku Mexico amene anayankhula mobisika chifukwa samaloledwa kupereka ndemanga poyera.	the united states and mexico on april 26 expelled a significant number of people from cuba and nicaragua, according to a senior mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to give details publicly.
511	It was prompted by higher numbers of migrants from those two countries coming to the U.S. border. 	Izi zinachitika chifukwa cha kuchuluka kwa anthu osamuka kuchokera ku maiko awiriwa  kubwe ku malire a dziko la America.	these events occurred due to the influx of people migrating from these two countries to the united states.
512	Mexico also took into account that the U.S. government had started processing visas in Cuba again, the official said. Mexico had also begun processing visas for Cubans. 	Dziko la Mexico linazindikira kuti boma la America linayambanso kukonza ziphaso zokhalira mdzikolo ku Cuba,  anatero akuluakuluwo. Boma la Mexico linali litayambanso kupangira anthu a ku Cuba ziphaso zokhalira mu dzikomo.	the country of mexico revealed that the american government had begun to build residential facilities in cuba, the elders said. the mexican government had also begun to provide residential facilities for the people of cuba in their country.
513	Another Mexican official, also not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans were being expelled from San Diego under Title 42. 	Mkulu winanso wa boma  wa dziko la Mexico amene sanaloledwenso kupereka ndemanga poyera, anatsimikiza kuti anthu makumi khumi a ku Cuba ndi makumi awiri a ku Nicaragua anathamangitsidwa kuchokera ku San Diego pansi pa mutu 42.	the senior government official of mexico, who was also not allowed to tell lies openly, emphasized that hundreds of people from cuba and twenty from nicaragua were expelled from san diego under section 42.
514	The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 	Unduna owona za chikhalidwe cha anthu ndi chitetezo  sunaperekepo ndemanga mwachangu monga mwa pempho.	the honorable who sees the culture of people and protection never lied hastily as requested.
515	Until last week, Mexico only agreed to take Guatemalans, Hondurans and El Salvadorans — in addition to Mexicans — under Title 42 authority. Other nationalities are subject to Title 42 but costs, strained diplomatic ties and other considerations often make it difficult to send them back to their home countries. 	Kuchokera sabata latha, Boma la Mexico linavomera kutenga anthu a ku Guatemala, Hondura, ndi ku El Salvadora poonjezerapo anthu a ku Mexico pansi pa mutu 42. Maiko enanso ali pansi pa mutuwu koma kamba ka chuma, kupsyinjika kwa mgwirizano wa maiko ndi zifukwa zina ndizomwe zikuvutitsa kuwabweza ku maiko akwao.	since last week, the mexican government has agreed to take in people from guatemala, honduras, and el salvador, adding to the 42 under the head of mexico. other countries are also under this head, but due to financial reasons, changes in international agreements, and other issues, it is difficult to return them to their home countries.
516	It's next to impossible for the U.S. to expel migrants to Cuba or Nicaragua because of poor relations with those governments. That has posed a challenge for the Biden administration as more people from those countries seek haven in the United States. 	Ndizosatheka ku Boma la America kubweza anthu a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua ku maiko akwawo chifukwa cha ubale osakhala bwino omwe uli pakati pa mabomawa. Izi zinayambita mavuto mu utsogoleri wa a Biden pamene anthu ambiri ochokera mu maikowa amafuna kuti akakhale pabwino ku America ko.	it will be possible for the us government to return people from cuba and nicaragua to their countries due to the poor relations that exist between these governments. this has caused problems in biden's leadership as many people from these countries want to live well in america.
517	Cubans were stopped by U.S. authorities more than 32,000 times on the Mexican border in March, double the number in February and more than five times October's count, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Nicaragua eased travel restrictions from Cuba in November, making it easier for Cubans to continue by land to the U.S. border. Most enter the U.S. in or near Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas. 	anthu a ku Cuba anaimitsidwa ndi akuluakulu a ku America koposera kokwana 32,000 pa malire a dziko la Mexico mu mwezi wa Malichi, kuonjezera nambalayi kawiri mu mwezi wa Febuluwale ndi kuposa kasanu mu chiwerengero cha mwezi wa Okotobala, malinga ndi  a chitetezo ndi oyendetsa katundu pa malire  a dziko la America. Boma la Nicaragua linakhwefula malamulo a mayendedwe kochokera ku Cuba mu mwezi wa Novembala zomwe zinapangitsa anthu a ku Cuba kupitilila ndikukafika ku malire a boma la America. Ambiri mwa iwo amalowa dziko la America kudzera kapena kuyandikila malo a ku Yuma, Arizona ndi ku Del Rio, Texas.	people from cuba were stopped by u.s. officials from crossing 32,000 times at the mexico border in march, doubling the number in february and more than five times the number in october, according to u.s. customs and border protection. the nicaraguan government tightened travel rules from cuba in november, causing cubans to continue to arrive at the u.s. border. many of them enter the united states through or register at places in yuma, arizona and del rio, texas.
518	Nicaraguans were stopped more than 16,000 times in March, more than double September's level. The vast majority enter in South Texas. 	Mu mwezi  wa Malichi anthu a ku Nicaragua analetsedwa ndi akuluakulu a ku America koposera ka 16000, kumene kunaposa mwezi wa September kawiri . Ambiri mwaiwo amalowa ku mmwera kwa dera la ku  Texas.	in the month of march, people from nicaragua were prevented by the american authorities from sending about 16,000, which was twice the amount sent in september. most of them were entering the southern part of the state of texas.
519	Lifting Title 42 has proved controversial as midterm elections near, even for Biden's Democratic Party, amid concerns that the U.S. is unprepared for an anticipated increase in migrants seeking asylum. Authorities stopped migrants more than 221,000 times in March, the highest mark in 22 years. 	kuchotsa mutu 42 kwakhala kotsutsana pamene pakati pa nthawi yochita masankho yayandikira, ngakhalenso ku Chipani cha mtsogoleri Biden, pakati pa kukhudzidwa kwa boma la America kuti silili lokonzeka kuonjezera chiwerengero cha anthu ofuna kulowa mdziko lawo kufuna pokhala. Akuluakulu aboma analetsa anthu ofuna kulowa mdziko koposera ka 221,000 mu mwezi wa March imene ili nambala yaikulu kuchokera mu zaka makumi awiri ndi ziwiri zapitazo.	the removal of the 42 heads has been controversial as the election period was underway, even within the party of leader biden, amid accusations that the american government is incapable of increasing the number of people wanting to enter their country for residency. government officials denied people wanting to enter the country, rejecting about 221,000 in the month of march, which is the highest number in the past twenty-two years.
520	The White House and Homeland Security Department have publicly stood behind the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to end the measure because it could no longer be justified on grounds of protecting public health. 	Nyumba ya chifumu ya ku America ndi unduna woona za chittezo ndi chikhalidwe yaima pambuyo chiganizo cha unduna  ochepetsa ndi kupewa matenda chothetsa lamulo chifukwa silinathenso kuthandizo komanso kuteteza pa za umoyo.	the house of authority in america is a true reflection of security and culture standing behind the idea of reducing and eradicating diseases not only for assistance but also for protection of life.
521	But the practice of expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans runs counter to the administration's public statements that it was phasing out use of the pandemic powers to prepare for May 23. 	Koma mchitidwe wosamutsa  anthu a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua ukutsutsana ndi ndemanga zomwe atsogoleri  amapereka poyera pothetsa kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka mphamvu za mliri pokonzekera pa 23 mwezi wa Meyi.	but the practice of not raising people in cuba and nicaragua contradicts the lies that leaders give openly to abolish the use of force in the preparation for may 23.
522	The U.S. has expelled migrants more than 1.8 million times under Title 42 authority since March 2020, effectively overriding rights to seek asylum under U.S. law and international treaty. In doing so, migrants are not subject to immigration law, which include rights to seek protection from persecution at home. 	Boma la America lasamutsa anthu 1.8 million olowa mu dzikolo pansi pa mutu  42 kuchokera mu mwezi wa march mu chaka cha 2020, Kupitilira ufulu wofuna pokhala pansi pa lamulo la ku America ndi pangano lapadziko lonse. Potero, anthu osamukasamuka  sakukhudzidwa ndi lamulo losamuka lomwe limakamba za ufulu ofuna kutetezedwa ku kuzunzika kwawo.	the united states government has deported 1.8 million people under the 42nd head in march 2020, continuing the freedom to seek asylum under us law and international agreement. therefore, immovable people are not affected by the mobility law that talks about the freedom to be protected from their suffering.
523	The administration said in court filings that it began processing more Central American adults under immigration laws after the CDC's announcement on April 1. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that it couldn't start unwinding Title 42 while it was still in effect. 	Mu zolemba za ku khoti utsogoleriwo unati unayamba kukonza kwambiri mapepala a anthu achikulire a pakati pa dziko la America pansi pa malamulo a kusamuka patatha zolengeza za bungwe la CDC's pa ! Epulo. Koma oweruza milandu sabata yatha analamulira kuti sakanatha kumasula mutu 42 pamene unali ukugwira ntchitobe.	in the court documents, the leader said he had begun heavily processing adult papers across the united states under the rise laws after the cdc's announcement on april 1st. however, the judge ruled last week that he could not complete head 42 while he was still working.
524	U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays strongly criticized the CDC's decision, suggesting he would try to keep Title 42 in effect after May 23. A hearing is scheduled May 13 for oral arguments. 	Oweluza milandu wa boma la America a Robert Summerhays anadzudzula maganizo a bungwe la CDS pamene anapereka maganizo ot ayesera kuti mutu 42 uzigwilabe ntchito mpakana tsiku la 23 mwezi wa Meyi. Kokamba mulanduwu kudzachitika pa 13 may.	the american government prosecutor robert summerhays criticized the ideas of the cds group when they suggested that section 42 should continue to operate until may 23rd. this case will be heard on may 13th.
525	Marisa Limon, senior director of advocacy and planning at the Hope Border Institute, said advocates began learning about expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans from El Paso on Monday and later confirmed the new practice with U.S. officials. 	A Marisa Limon, mkulu woyang'anila kulimbikitsa ndi kukonzekera ku Bungwe lotchedwa, Hope Border Institute , anati olimbikitsawa anayamba kudziwa za kusamutsidwa kwa anthu a ku Cuba ndi ku Nicaragua kuchokera kwa El Paso lolemba ndipo anatsimikiza mchitidwe watsopanowu ndi akuluakulu a boma la America.	marisa limon, head of advocacy and development at the hope border institute, said the advocates began hearing about the expulsions of people from cuba and nicaragua from el paso and confirmed this new practice with us government officials.
526	"Limon said the administration is ""trying to get every last bit out of Title 42"" before it expires. She called it ""sobering"" but consistent with the administration's efforts to have other countries in the Western hemisphere take more responsibility for hosting people fleeing their homes. "	A Limon anati  utsogoleri wawo ukuyesetsa kudziwa mapeto onse a mutu 42 usanasiye kugwira ntchito. Iwo anaufotokoza kuti ndi wanzeru koma pakuyenera kuti atsogoleri aziikilako khama kuti maiko ena a kumadzulo kwa dziko lapansi akhalenso ndi udindo wosunga anthu othawa kwawo.	limon said their leader is trying to know all the ends of the 42-headed beast before leaving office. they explained that he is wise but there should be compassion so that other countries in the western world also have a responsibility to protect refugees.
527	Mexico Relocates Migrant Camp; Haitians Appear at Border 	Boma la Mexico lasamutsa misasa ya anthu osamukira mu dzikolo; anthu aku  Haiti aonekera pa malire a dziko.	the mexican government has lifted restrictions on refugees in the country; haitians appear on the country's borders.
528	Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have relocated a migrant camp that sprung up in a park in the border city of Reynosa, moving about 2,000 people from Central America and Haiti to a shelter in the city, across the border from McAllen, Texas. 	Akuluakulu a boma la Mexico lachiwiri amati asamutsa msasa wa  anthu olowa mu dzikolo omwe unatulukira ku ndime  mu mzinda wa malirewo wa  Reynosa,  asuntha pafupifupi anthu mazana awiri kuchoka pakati pa Boma la america ndi Haiti kupita ku malo  ena owasungilako  kuolokera ku malire ochokera ku McAllen Texas.	the second government of mexico has said it will not increase the number of people entering the country, which originated from a shelter in the border town of reynosa, transferring approximately two dozen people from the united states and haiti to other detention places, fleeing from a shelter in mcallen, texas.
529	The camp of migrants mainly from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti sprung up after U.S. officials, citing the pandemic, invoked a health rule that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum. 	Malo okhala anthu osamukila dzikolo makamaka ochokera ku dziko la Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras ndi ku Haiti kunachuluka anthu pamene akuluakulu a boma la America  anabweretsa lamulo la zaumoyo loletsa anthu osamukira mu dzikolo kupeza mwayi wopatsidwa chitetezo chifukwa cha mliri.	the places where people, especially from countries like guatemala, el salvador, honduras, and haiti, used to stay have become overcrowded since the us government introduced a law that prevents immigrants in the country from getting asylum due to the pandemic.
530	Mexico's National Immigration Institute said the migrants were taken around midnight Monday to the shelter, which it said will have better hygiene and food services. 	Bungwe loona zolowa ndi kutuluka kwa anthu mu dziko la Mexico lotchedwa ( Mexico's Immigration Institute linati  anthuwo anatengedwa lolemba pakati pa usiku kupita ku malo owasungilawo amene akuyenera kukhala a ukhondo komanso chakudya chabwino.	this organization is concerned with the immigration and emigration of people in the country of mexico (mexico's immigration institute said these people were taken to write in the middle of the night to go to the places where they are supposed to be soldiers and also good food.
531	But on Monday, people in another border city, Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of migrants, mainly Haitians, have streamed into that city, which is across the border from Laredo, Texas 	Lolemba lomwelo anthu ochokera ku malire a dziko a ku Nuevo Laredo anafotokoza kuti anthu opitilira makumi khumi makamaka a dziko la Haiti anakhamikira mu mzindawo umene uli mbali yoyang'anana ndi malire a dzikolo kochokera ku Laredo, Texas	the letter from the people of the border of nuevo laredo explained that over a hundred people, especially from the country of haiti, settled in the area which is adjacent to the border of this country from laredo, texas.
532	The rush apparently started after the U.S. began processing some asylum-seekers there. 	Kukhamikilako kunayamba pamene boma la America linayamba ndondomeko yopereka chitetezo kwa anthu othawira mu dzikolo.	the persistence began when the american government started a system to provide protection for refugees in the country.
533	The Catholic bishop of Nuevo Laredo said Monday that migrant shelters there are overcrowded, with some migrants sleeping outside in tents. 	Mkulu wa mpingo wa katolika wa ku Nuevo, lolemba apati malo okhalako anthu osamukila mu dzikolo  ndi othinana pamene anthu ena akugona panja pa misanja.	the head of the catholic church in nuevo, writes that there are places for people to stay in the church and eat while others are sleeping outside in the cold.
534	Bishop Enrique Sánchez Martínez said migrants started streaming into Nuevo Laredo in late April, though the city isn't usually popular among migrants, in part because it is dominated by the violent Northeast drug cartel. 	A Bishopu Enrique Sanchez Martínez anati anthuwa anayamba kulowera ku Nuevo Laredo ku mapeto kwa mwezi wa Epulo, ngakhale mzindawo sudziwika kwambiri ndi anthu ochokera maiko ena, chifukwa unadzadzidwa ndi zigawenga za ku Northeast drug carte	bishop enrique sanchez martinez said these people began to enter nuevo laredo at the end of april, even though the place is not well known to people from other countries, because it was infested with gangs from the northeast drug cartel.
535	"""It is new for us because this is the last place they come, due to the conditions of our border, of our city, which are sometimes adverse for migrants,"" the bishop said. ""But since they opened the door in the United States to asylum requests, a lot of them came in large groups."" "	‘Izi ndi zachilendo kwa ife chifukwa awa ndi malo omalizira amene iwo sangabwereko, chifukwa cha mkhalidwe wa  malire dziko lathu, mu mzinda wathu umene umatsutsana ndi anthu osamukila mu dzikoli” anatero mkulu wansembeyo.

"""these are strange to us because these are the final places they cannot come to, because of the behavior of our country's refugees, in our city that opposes immigrants,"" said the elder of the assembly. but because the us government opened a door to provide protection and places for refugees, many of them came en masse."
536	Marvin Ajic, the director of the Casa Nazareth shelter, said that around April 16, Mexican authorities notified the shelters that the United States would resume processing asylum claims for humanitarian reasons. 	A Marvin Ajic, mkulu wa malo osungira anthu a ku Casa Nazareth anati pa 16 Epulo, akuluakulu a boma la Mexico anadziwitsa anthu a ku malo osungidwawo kuti boma a America liyamba  ndondomeko yothandiza anthu othawira dzikolo pa zifukwa zothandizila anthu.	on april 16, marvin ajic, the head of casa nazareth shelter, informed the people in the shelter that the mexican government announced that the american government will start a process to help refugees in their country for humanitarian reasons.
537	The U.S. had begun allowing more people in, especially Central American adults, to prepare for lifting Title 42 — a pandemic-era health rule that denies migrants a chance to enter the U.S. seek asylum — on May 23. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that the government could not unwind the rule before the end date. 	Boma la America linali litayamba kulowetsa anthu mdzikolo makamaka akuluakulu a pakati pa dziko la America pokonzekera kuchotsa mutu 42, lamulo la nthawi ya mliri limene limakaniza anthu kusamukira mdziko la America kufuna chitetezo.

626	Mr. Fontaine says, as part of various peace packages in the Great Lakes region, the World Bank and other donors are providing $500 million to help demobilize children. He says, unfortunately, the needed government institutions are not yet in place in some countries to move the process ahead quickly enough. He says that's why UNICEF is pressing to see such structures develop, so that children can get back home and start to lead normal lives once again.

721	Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2015 	Olondoloza  zachuma aneneratu kuti chuma cha dziko la Malawi chitha osayenda bwino mu chaka cha 2015.	the economic analysts have predicted that the economy of malawi may not perform well in the year 2015.
722	Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate. More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested. 	Olondoloza chuma mu dziko la Malawi afotokoza kuti dziko lino litha kupitilira kukumana ndi mavuto a zachuma pokhapokha anthu othandiza ataloweleleraponso, anthu othandizawa sanapereke mbali ya chithandizo cha ndalama yogwiritsira ntchito ku boma chokwanira gawo la 40% kamba ka mchitidwe wa katangale wotchedwa cashgate. Ndalama zopitilira 30 million dollars ndi zomwe zinabedwa kuboma. Anthu ambiri  kuphatikizapo ogwira ntchito m'boma anamangidwa.	the custodian of wealth in malawi explains that this country may continue to face economic problems even after the aid workers have intervened, these helpers did not contribute a sufficient portion of financial aid to the government, covering only 40% due to the corruption scandal known as cashgate. a continuing $30 million is what was stolen from the government. many people, including government workers, were arrested.
723	The withholding of donor aid has forced Malawi's government to pass what is known as the Zero Aid national budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year. Analysts, such as Abel Mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy. 	Kuimitsidwa kwa chithandizo chochokera maiko ena kwakakamiza dziko la malawi kudutsitsa madongosolo a ndalama  a chaka cha 2014-2015 otchedwa Zero Aid national budget. A  Abel Mwanyungwe mmodzi ounguza komanso mphunzitsi wa ndondomeko za chuma ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Polytechnic College anati kutsika kwa kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama  kwasokoneza ndondomeko ya chuma.	the suspension of aid from other countries forced malawi to implement the 2014-2015 financial year's zero aid national budget. abel mwanyungwe, a lecturer and economist at polytechnic college, said the reduction in the use of money disrupted the economic system.
724	"""This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance. We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals. In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time,"" said Mwanyungwe. "	"""Chaka chino chakhala chovuta kwambiri pamene tikuchokera kuzotsatira za Cashgate zimene zaononga kayendetsedwe ka chuma. Malo antchito ambiri komanso anthu obweretsa katundu mdzikoli akhudzidwa monga tilibe mankhwala mzipatala, komanso malipiro a aphunzitsi sakumafika mu nthawi yake, anatero a mwanyungwe."	"""this year has been very challenging as we are recovering from the effects of cashgate that ruined our economy. many workplaces and people who bring goods into the country have been affected, such as a lack of medicine in hospitals, and teachers' salaries not being paid on time, said the spokesperson."""
725	Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay. 	A Manyungwe analumikizanso kutsika kwa ndalama ya Malawi ndi kubedwa kwa ndalama mosakadza komwe kunachitika, zomwe zachititsa zionetsero kuchokera kwa  anthu osiyanasiyana ogwira ntchito m'boma pomwe akufuna kukwezedwa malipiro awo.	manyungwe also criticized the devaluation of the malawi currency and the rampant theft of money, which has caused protests from various government employees who want their salaries increased.
726	For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money. 	Mwachitsanzo anthu othandizira ntchito ku khoti akhala akunyanyala ntchito kwa masabata asanu ndi imodzi pofuna kuti malipiro awo akwezedwe kufika pa 45% zomwe aboma akuti sangakwanitse kutero  chifukwa alibe ndalama.	for example, court workers have been striking for five weeks demanding a 45% pay rise, which the government says it cannot afford because it does not have the money.
727	Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return. 	Ogwira ntchito a ku bungwe lothana ndi ziphuphu ananyanyala ntchito pofuna kuti malipiro awo akwezedwe kufika pa 70%  koma a boma anawaopseza kuti salandira malipiro awo a mwezi wa Disembala ngati sabwelera kunchito.	the employees at the tuberculosis association disgraced themselves by demanding a 70% salary increase, but the government threatened them that they would not receive their december salaries if they did not return to work.
728	Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances. 	A Manyungwe anati boma litha kupewa kunyanyala ntchito kwinanso mu chaka cha 2015 ngati lingayesetse  kubwezeretsa chikhulupiliro cha anthu othandiza boma pa kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama za dziko.	manyungwe said that the government could be embarrassed again in 2015 if it fails to restore the confidence of the people who support the government in the use of the country's money.
729	"""My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, we may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation,"" said Mwanyungwe. "	Chomwe ndikuopa ndichakuti ngati athu otithandiza sangatikhulupilirenso, ndikukhalanso opanda chithandizo ku ndondomeko ya chuma chathu, boma litha kukakamizidwa kukabwerekanso ndalama mudziko mommuno zomwe zingadzetse mavuto monga kukwera kwa zinthu, kudzera mu ndalama yaapamwamba yoperekedwa pobweza ndalama. Iyi ndi nyengo yapakatikati, anatero a Manyungwe.	what i fear is that if our helpers no longer trust us, i will be left without assistance in the management of our economy, the government may be forced to print more money in this country which could cause problems such as inflation, increase in the high denomination money given when repaying money. this is a transitional period, said manyungwe.
730	The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system. 	Mwa zina zomwe anthu othandizawa akufuna dziko lichite ndi kumanga anthu onse amene anakhudzidwa ndi kuba ndalamazo ndicholinga cholimbitsa njira ya  kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama.	among the things that these helpers want the country to do is to arrest all those who were involved in the theft of these funds with the aim of strengthening the way money is used.
731	"Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered 2014 as ""a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector."" "	Mtsogoleri wa bungwe la Malawi Confederation of Chambers of commerce and Industry a Newton kambala, anati kuba ndalama komwe kunachitika mu chaka cha 2014 kunaipitsa nthambi ya anthu ochita malonda chifukwa cha ngongole zochuluka zomwe boma linali nazo kwa anthu a malondawa.	the spokesperson of the malawi confederation of chambers of commerce and industry, newton kambala, said that the theft of money that occurred in 2014 adversely affected the livelihoods of business people due to the high debts the government owed to these business people.
732	"He warned that if the situation persists, ""2015 will be worse."" "	Iwo anachenjeza kuti ngati zipitilire chonchi, chaka cha 2015 chidzaipa kuposera pano.	they warned that if things continue like this, the year 2015 will be worse than now.
733	In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal. 	Mtsogoleri wa dziko lino a Peter Mutharika pamene amalankhula ku  mtundu wa a  Malawi loweruka lapitali, anati boma lawo likuyesetsa kuchita mothekera kukonza mavuto amene anadza ndi kuba ndalama.	the leader of this country, peter mutharika, while addressing the people of malawi during a capital city tour, said that their government is trying to rectify the problems that arose from money theft.
734	"""My government has strengthened the financial system to make sure that Cashgate never occurs again in Malawi. We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible,"" said Mutharika. "	"Boma langa lakhwimitsa malamulo ku nthambi ya zachuma oonetsetsa kuti kuba ndalama mosakadza kusadzachitikenso mu dziko la Malawi. Tayesetsa kupereka katundu wokwanira wogwilira ntchito mu mabungwe a malamulo,  othetsa katangale kuti agwire ntchito  moyenelera, amange onse akuganiziridwa, komanso kulanda katundu yense anabedwa ngati kuli kotheka,"" anatero a Mutharika."	"""my government has strengthened laws on economic crimes to ensure that theft of money without remorse will not happen again in malawi. we have tried to provide adequate resources to law enforcement agencies, to eliminate corruption so that they can work properly, prosecute all suspects, and also to recover all stolen assets if possible,"" said mutharika."
735	Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013. 	A Mutharika anatinso boma lawo libweretsa njira yatsopano ya kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama zaboma kamene kakulitse chuma cha dziko kufika pa 5.5% mu chaka  cha 2014 kuchokera pa 5.0 percent mu chaka cha 2013.	mutharika also said their government would introduce a new way of using government funds that would increase the country's wealth to 5.5% in 2014, up from 5.0 percent in 2013.
736	Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing 	Dziko la Malawi liyamba kuyeza matenda a edzi khomo ndi khomo.	the country of malawi is beginning to test for hiv door to door.
737	Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year. Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily. Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga. 	Amalawi  ali ndi maganizo osiyanasiyana pamene boma likukonzekera kuyambitsa kuyeza matenda a edzi khomo ndi khomo kumayambiliro kwa chaka cha mawa.

738	"""We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not. And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need. And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative,"" said Kalirani. "	Tizipita mmidzi kukatenga magazi kwa anthu pofuna kudziwa ngati ali ndi kachiromboko kapena ayi. Amene azipezeka ndi matendawo azipatsidwa chisamaliro choyenera. Ndipo amene alibe azipatsidwa malangizo a mmene angakhalire osatengabe matendawo, anatero a kalirani.	we will go to the villages to collect blood from people to find out if they have cancer or not. those found with the disease should be given appropriate treatment. and those who do not have it should be given advice on how to live without getting the disease, said the nurse.
739	Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services. She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030. Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago. 	A kalirani anati ntchitoyi iyamba mkatikati mwa mwezi wa Malichi ndipo afikira munthu aliyense amene ali ndi kachilombo kapena ayi, kuphatikizapo anthu amene anatalikilana ndi zipatala zazing'ono zomwe zimayeza magazi komanso kupereka uphungu.

740	The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy. 	Izi zitalengezedwa, zadzetsa mantha mwa amalawi ena ngati  a Steven Jailosi mphunzitsi wa sukulu ya pulaimale mu mzinda wa Blantyre amene akuona ngati  ntchitoyi idzaika zinsinsi za anthu poyera.	these revelations have caused fear among some malawians, like steven jailosi, a teacher at a primary school in the city of blantyre, who sees this as an invasion of people's privacy.
741	"""I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. HIV testing is supposed to be private. No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them,"" said Jailosi. "	Ine ndikuona ngati njirayi siyabwino chifukwa ndizosemphana ndi moyo wathu wa Chinsinsi. Kuyezetsa magazi kumayenera kukhala kobisika. Palibe amene amayenera kudziwa zoti ndinapita kukayezetsa magazi pokhapokha nditapanga chisankho chomuuza, anatero a Jailosi.	i see this policy as not good because it interferes with our private life. blood testing should be confidential. no one should know that i went for blood testing alone unless i choose to tell them, said jailosi.
742	Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy. 	 A Ester Makonokaya,  mlembi mu mzinda wa Blantyre anena kuti ngakhale iwo ayezedwa kale akuona kuti kuyeza magazi khomo ndi khomo ndi kuononga zinsinsi za anthu.	ester makonokaya, a nurse in the city of blantyre, says that even though they have been tested before, she believes that testing blood from door to door is invading people's privacy.
743	"""Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions,"" said Makonokaya. "	Boma likuyenera kutenga zipatala zoyendera mmidzi komwe anthu akakwanitse kuyezetsa pawokha kusiyana ndi kuyezedwa mmakomo mwawo, chifukwa anthu amene samayenera kudziwa zotsatira zawo atha kudziwa chifukwa munthu amene wayezedwa magazi khalidwe lake limasintha, anatero a Makonokaya.	the government should set up mobile clinics in rural areas where people can test themselves instead of being tested in their homes, because people who are not supposed to know their results might find out because a person's behavior changes after they have been tested for blood, said makonokaya.
744	"Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own ""without being pushed.""

745	"""I fear it could end up into fights. You see it happened in Liberia recently where people who were coming to help people suspected to have contracted Ebola were even killed.

Maiko anayi okha mu Afilika, Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda ndi Uganda  ndi amene atha kukwanitsa zolinga zawo.	these countries alone in africa, ethiopia, malawi, rwanda and uganda are the ones that can achieve their goals.
788	This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years. The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015. The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030.

789	According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off.

792	"""Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, that is why this call for manufacturing,"" he said.

794	On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly. UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community. And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year.

797	Most African countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 because of the gap between economic and human development. That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday. 	Maiko ambiri amu Afilika safikira zolinga zawo za chitukuko kufikira chaka cha 2015 chifukwa chakusiyana komwe kulipo pakati pa ndalama ndi chitukuko cha anthu.

A Junior Davis amene amayan'ganira nkhani zokhudza ndalama mu Afilika kuchokera ku bungwe lla U.N, anati maiko a ku Afilika sanakwanitse  kusintha makulidwe a chuma chawo kupita ku kachitidwe ka mphamvu kopindulitsa.	junior davis, who discusses financial matters in africa from the u.n organization, said that african countries have failed to change their economic behaviors to transformative power.
799	"""We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities,"" Davis said. ""These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development. And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities."" "	Tikuona  ngati izi zili choncho chifukwa maikowa salimbikira kumanga kapena kuchita malonda ndi zinthu zomwe zingawabweretsere  phindu lochuluka, anatero a Davis.

801	African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow. Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity.

Chitukuko cha zachuma chimayenera kupindula mu chitukuko cha anthu.	the lives of africans were not on a path to alleviate poverty and hunger by the year 2015, and their future in reducing hunger and thirst is greatly challenged. poverty not only hinders development but also distorts the behavior of things. economic development should reflect in human development.
802	Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi are the only African countries on track to reach the majority of the development goals. They are making progress because they heavily invested in areas that create sustainable development such as infrastructure, health and education. 	Maiko a Ethiopia, Malawi ndi Rwanda ndi amene ali mu njira yokwanitsa njira za chitukukozi.

803	The post-2015 development agenda for fragile countries where governance remains an issue — such as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo — will still largely depend on support from the international community to achieve social and economic development, Davis said. 	Ndondomeko ya chitukuko ya chaka cha 2015 yokhudza maiko amene ulamuliro udakali nkhani yovuta, monga dziko la South Sudan ndi Democratic Republic of Congo, kwakukulu azidalirabe thandizo lochokera ku gulu la dziko lonse kuti  afikire chitukuko cha anthu ndi chuma, anatero a Davis. ndalama ndi chikhalidwe, anatero a Davis.	the development issue of 2015 concerning countries where governance was still a problem, such as south sudan and the democratic republic of congo, mainly still depended on aid from the global community to achieve human and economic development, said davis. money and culture, davis added.
804	"Improvements in rural development, industrial productivity, agriculture and the services sectors in these countries will require ""ways in which we can have a pattern of growth which is not just sustainable but jobs-rich,"" Davis said. ""Because we see the growth in jobs and employment is central to any development strategy that aims to reduce poverty in a sustainable way."" "	"Kusintha chitukuko cha mmidzi, zokolola za makampani, ulimi ndi malo a ntchito mu maiko amenewa, payenera kukhala ndondomeko ya kukula kokhazikika komanso ntchito zolemera,"" anatero a Davis.

809	Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week.  Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.   	Kuimba mozungulira malo a khotilo kwakhala chizolowezi cha anthu onyanyala ntchitowo kuchokera sabata yatha. A Linley Herbert, woyankhulira anthu onyanyala ntchitowa wauza wailesi ya VOA kuti kunyanyala ntchitoku ndi kamba ka kulephera kukwaniritsa lonjezo lomwe boma linapereka mu mgwirizano wawo chaka cha 2012.	singing around the church premises has been a routine for people who defecate in the open since last week. linley herbert, a spokesperson for the people who defecate in the open, told voa listeners that this practice is due to the failure to fulfill the promise that the government made in their agreement in 2012.
810	"""In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision,"" Hebert said.  "	"Mu mwezi wa Okotobala chaka chino, boma linakonzaso malipiro a anthu ogwira ntchito mb'oma, koma ife sitinaikidwe nawo mgululi,"" anatero a Herbert."	"""in the month of october this year, the government again adjusted the salaries of government employees, but we were not impressed by the increment,"" said herbert."
811	"""Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well].  "	"""Pamene chaka cha 2012 tinagwirizana  nawo kuti pamene akukonza malipiro a ogwira ntchito, azionjezeranso malipiro athu."	in 2012, we agreed with them that when they are adjusting the salaries of workers, they should also increase our salaries.
812	"So, [after adhering to the agreement in 2013], we are surprised to see that this time we are left out.""  Government authorities say the failure to increase judicial workers salaries this year is largely because of financial constraints, following a donor aid freeze against Malawi's government.  "	"Patatha mgwirizano wathu mu chaka cha 2013 tikudabwa kuti ulendo uno sanatiikepo."" akuluakulu aboma anati kulephera kukweza malipiro kwa ogwira ntchito mu ofesi yoweruza milandu ndichifukwa cha mavuto a zachuma, kuchokera ku kusiya kulandira chithandizo kwa dziko la Malawi kuchokera kwa othandiza."	"""our agreement ended in 2013 and we are surprised that this journey has not yet taken place,"" said senior government officials, citing economic difficulties, from the cessation of aid to malawi from donors, as the reason for failing to raise salaries for employees in the office that reviews cases."
813	The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers.  Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.   	Kuimitsa kulandira thandizoku ndi chifukwa cha ndalama zoposa 30 miliyoni zomwe zinabedwa ndiogwira ntchito m'boma. Mneneri wa unduna wa za chuma a Nations Msowoya anauza wailesi ina kuti ndizovuta kuti dziko lifikire zofuna za ogwira ntchitowa.	the delay in receiving aid is due to over 30 million money that was stolen by government employees. the spokesperson for the minister of finance, nations msowoya, told one broadcaster that it would be difficult for the country to meet the needs of these workers.
814	"""It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands,"" ""Msowoya said. "	"""Ndizovuta kulonjeza zomwe asungi chuma angachite. Koma titha kunena kuti ndimmene nyengo yachuma iliri ndi zopinga za bajeti, zikhala zovutirapo kuchita monga mmene iwo akufunira,"" anatero a Msowoya."	"""it will be difficult to predict what wealth managers can do. but we can say that given the current economic climate and budget constraints, it will be challenging to act as they wish,"" said msowoya."
815	"But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met.  ""Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money.  "	"A Herbert anati athu onyanyala ntchitowo  sayambiranso  kugwira ntchito pokhapokha atalandira zofuna zawo. "" Chibadwileni changa palibe nthawi yomwe a boma ananena kuti ali ndi ndalama."	"""herbert said that the arrogant ones started working alone after receiving what they wanted. ""my birthright has no time when the government said they have money."
816	"It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money,"" Hebert insisted.  The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended.   "	"Boma liri ndi njira zake zopezera ndalama ndipo lipeza njira zomwezo kutipatsa ife ndalama,"" ananenetsa a Herbert. Kunyanyala ntchitoku kukusokoneza kuzenga milandu pamene ntchito za khoti zaimitsidwa."

819	"Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is ""giving police bail to those with minor offenses.""   Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations.   "	Mneneri wa polisi  a Rhoda Manjolo anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti kuti njira yokhayo yomwe alinayo ndi  kuwatulutsa kaye  anthu amene ali ndi zolakwa zazing'ono.

822	Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe.  But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.   	Akuluakulu a boma anati akuchita zokambirana mu mzinda wa Lilongwe kuti alongosole nkhaniyi.

826	"World Food Program officials say they need one million tons of food to alleviate hunger in southern Africa, but they are not confident they will get it. In an appeal to the international community at the beginning of July, WFP officials asked for more than $0.5 billion to buy food. So far they have received only 20 percent of that. WFP's director for the southern Africa region, Judith Lewis, says the situation is getting desperate. ""The window of opportunity to avert what could be a major humanitarian crisis is closing,"" she said. ""We need more assistance now. We need food on the high seas now, or we need cash to buy commodities that are still available in southern Africa, so we can avert this major, major crisis.""
