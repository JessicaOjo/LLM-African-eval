221	There are serious allegations of corruption against an NEC member which is comrade Zweli Mkhize, who is currently deployed as minister of health.

236	There is no renewal that will take place in an organisation which does not have capacity to instil discipline among its members.	Ga gona ntšhwafatso e e tlaa diragalang mo mokgatlhong o o senang bokgoni jwa go tlhotlheletsa maitshwaro a a siameng kgatlhanong le maloko a ona.	there will be no improvement happening in an organization that lacks the ability to stimulate diverse ideas in relation to its members.

'step-aside' is one of the measures taken to ensure that we will put our system on the path of improvement.
238	The issue of the Secretary-General is, there is none of us, there is no self-respect in the member of the ANC who won’t be disappointed by Secretary-General who takes the ANC to court, and I get a sense that he is doing that because he’s got quite a distorted logic about his own role as the Secretary-General.	Ntlha ya mokwaledikakaretso ke gore, ga go ope wa rona, ga gona leloko la ANC le le itlotlang, le le  ka se swabiseweng ka mokwaledi-kakaretso yo o isang  mokgatlho wa ANC kwa kgotlhatshekelong, mme ke lemoga gore o dira jaana ka ntlha ya gore o na le dikakanyo tse di sa siamang ka ga seabe sa gagwe jaaka mokwaledikakaretso.	the main issue with the chief editor is that, there is none of us, no member of the anc who is respected, who can be disrespected by a chief editor who puts the anc party into disrepute, and i realize that he does this because he has ideas that are not consistent with his role as a chief editor.

Re ikemiseditse go diragatsa taelo e e re neetsweng ke khonferense ya Nasrec ka gonne batsamaise ba khonferense eno ba buile gore maloko otlhe a NEC, a lekala la ANC a tshwanetse go dira mmogo le ka natla go kopanya le go aga bošwa mokgatlho o wa rona o o galalelang.	we are committed to implementing the mandate given to us by the nasrec conference because the leaders of this conference have said that all nec members, the anc branch, must work together and strongly to unite and build the prestige of our renowned organization.
246	When we speak of unity, we are referring to principled unity and now you have coined it beautifully in the Northern Cape, organic unity.	Fa re bua ka ga kopano, re raya molaotheo, mme jaanong le e tlhamile sentle kwa Kapa Bokone, kopano e e tsepameng.	when we talk about the meeting, we mean the constitution, and now that you have clearly understood it in north cape, the meeting is in progress.

Go bua Mmueledi wa ANC wa kwa KZN Nhakanipho Ntombela.	they are not security guards appointed by the municipality, they are stories of the prophet. says the anc spokesperson in kzn, nhakanipho ntombela.

337	The Democratic Alliance (DA) has described as irrational and obscure a law that strips South Africans of their citizenship.	Mokgatlho wa Democratic Alliance (DA) o tlhalositse molao o o sa utlwagaleng le go tlhaloganyega o o amogang maAforika Borwa boagi jwa bona.	the democratic alliance (da) party has explained a law that is not understood and confusing that affects south africans' rights.
338	This follows complaints from citizens based in London who tried to renew their South African citizenship, only to discover that they are no longer South African citizens because they have claimed additional citizenship.	Se se latela dingongorego go tswa go baagi ba ba nnang kwa London, fa ba leka go ntšhwafatsa boagi jwa bona jwa Aforika Borwa, ba lemoga fa ba sa tlhole e le baagi ba Aforika Borwa ka gonne ba kopile tlaleletso ya boagi.	following complaints from residents living in london, when they tried to improve their south african citizenship, they realized that they were no longer south african citizens because they had applied for citizenship.
339	This is because, under the current Citizenship Act in South Africa, you have to first apply to the Department of Home Affairs for permission to get another citizenship.	Se ke ka ntlha ya gore, ka fa tlase ga Molao wa Boagi mo Aforika Borwa wa ga jaana, o tshwanetse go dira kopo kwa Lefapheng la Merero ya Selegae go bona tetla ya go bona boagi jwa naga e nngwe.	this is because, under the current south african immigration act, you must apply to the department of home affairs to obtain a visa to visit another country.
340	However, DA MP Adrian Roos says the party is opposed to this law and will fight it in the High Court on behalf of thousands of South Africans who have lost their citizenship without their knowledge.	Le gale, Leloko la palamente la DA Adrian Roos a re lekoko le kgatlhanong le Molao o, mme le tlaa lwantshana le ona kwa  kgotlatshekelong e e kwa godimo mo boemong jwa diketekete tsa MaAforika Borwa a a latlhegetsweng ke boagi kwa ntle ga kitso ya bona.	unfortunately, i am an assistant trained in english and currently do not have the ability to translate setswana.
341	The DA is challenging this law in court.	DA e gwetlhana le Molao ono kwa kgotlatshekelo.	the da is at odds with this law in the court.
342	It is not a particularly rational law seeing as the Department of Home Affairs has previously stated that it has nothing against dual citizenship.	Ga se molao o o utlwagalang jaaka le Lefapha la Merero ya Selegae le kile la tlhalosa gore ga le kgatlhanong le boagi jwa dinaga tse pedi.	it is not a law that is heard as the department of public affairs once explained that it is not in conflict with the laws of the two countries.
343	But if that’s your policy, then you must not say you support dual citizenship.	Fela ke molao wa lona, lo seke lwa re lo tshegetsa boagi jwa dinaga tse pedi.	but it's your law, don't let it support the crime of the two countries.
344	If you look at the interim Constitution, it spoke about the fact that no citizen shall be without justification, and this was changed in the final Constitution.	Fa o lebelela Molaotheo wa nakwana, o bua ka ntlha ya gore ga go moagi yo a tlaa nnang kwa ntle ga tshegetso ya molao, mme se se fetotswe mo Molaotheong.	when you look at the constitution of the country, it speaks to the fact that there is no criminal who will be outside the support of the law, and this has been amended in the constitution.
345	They removed the words without justification to say this right should obsolete that you shouldn’t be deprived of your citizenship.	Ba tlositse mafoko ntle le go tlhalosa gore tshwanelo eno e tshwanetse e seke ya tsenngwa tirisong gore o seke wa ganelwa ka boagi jwa gago.	they have left out words without explaining that this right should not be put into action so that you are not denied your dignity.
346	So the argument of the DA is that if anything, you should have to legitimately and actively renounce your citizenship before you can lose it, says Roos.	Ka jalo ngangisano ya DA ke gore, le fa go ka nna jang, o tshwanetse go nna le tumelelo ya go ka tlogela boagi jwa gago pele bo ka go latlhegela, go bua  Roos.	therefore, the da's argument is that, no matter what, you must have the courage to leave your sin before it can destroy you, says roos.
347	Below is the full interview with DA MP Adrian Roos.	Fa tlase, ke ditherisano tse di feleletseng tsa leloko la DA Adrian Roos.	below are the completed discussions of da member adrian roos.

354	But I think we should take from what the President has said that this is being attended to.	Fela ke akanya gore re tshwanetse go tsaya  se Moporesidente a se buileng gore kgang e e lebeletswe.	however, i think we should take what the vice president said into consideration as the matter has been reviewed.
355	Earlier the Special Investigation Units Kaizer Kganyago says they’re still investigating and plan to conclude the probe soon.

357	Mabuza was addressing a group of military veterans in Limpopo on Saturday.	Mabuza o ne a bua le setlhopha sa baitseanape ba badiredi ba sesole kwa Limpopo ka Lamatlhatso.	mabuza was speaking with a group of volunteer soldiers in limpopo on tuesday.
358	He has urged military veterans to form one single group instead of fighting one another.	O kopile baitseanape ba sesole gore ba ipope go nna ngatana e le nngwe go na le gore ba lwantshane ka bo bona.	he asked the school children to strive to be number one and to compete with themselves.
359	Well, the money has not been used, it lies in the department because there is a number of problems, but the military veterans are complaining.	Le gale, madi ga a ise a dirisiwe, a dutse kwa lefapheng ka gonne go na le mathata a le mantsinyana, fela baitseanape ba badiredi ba sesole ba a ngongorega.	unfortunately, the money was not used, it was left on the table because there were minor problems, but the union representatives were complaining.
360	The biggest problem that we are facing is the verification program which affects the no statutory forces.

367	You must try and organise yourselves, we don’t want these groupings amongst yourselves because we don’t understand why you are fighting amongst yourselves.	Lo tshwanetse go leka le go ipaakanya ka bolona, ga re batle ditlhophatlhophana tseno magareng ga lona ka ntlha ya gore ga re tlhaloganye gore goreng lo lwa ka bolona.	you should try to reconcile among yourselves, we do not want these squabbles among you because we do not understand why you are fighting among yourselves.
368	You are a community that is getting smaller and smaller, you are a community that is aging so why would old people fight among themselves, MKVA, and the military council you must go and solve your issues with immediate effect.	Lo setšhaba se se nnang se fokotsega gannyane le gannyane, le setšhaba se se tsofalang jaanong goreng batsofe ba ka batla go lwantshana ka bo bona, MKVA, le Khansele ya sesole tsamayang  go rarabolola mathata a lona ka bonako.	this community that is gradually shrinking, and the community that is currently growing so that the elders may want to fight for themselves, mkva, and the council of the army, go and solve your problems visibly.

379	He cited a recent audit outcome and a high court ruling that the appointment of certain acting senior managers was irregular.

381	The decision to challenge Hlomuka’s action was taken during a council meeting on Thursday, a day after the provincial Cooperative Governance Department announced that it is placing the municipality under administration.	Tshwetso ya go gwetlha dikgato tsa  ga Hlomuka e tserwe ka nako ya kopano ya Khansele ka Labone, letsatsi morago ga porofense ya Lefapha la Taolo ya Kopanelo e dira kitsiso ya go baya mmasepala ka fa tlase ga tsamaiso.	the decision to review hlomuka's steps was taken at the council meeting on thursday, the day after the department of cooperative governance made an announcement to put the municipality under administration.
382	In February, the provincial government placed the municipality under administration.	Ka Tlhakole, puso ya porofense e ne ya baya mmasepala ka fa tlase ga tsamaiso.	in september, the provincial government placed the municipality under administration.
383	But the decision was overturned by the National Minister of Co-operative Governance Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.	Mme tshwetso e ne ya busediwa morago ke Tona ya Bosetšhaba ya puso, ngaka Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.......	however, the decision was later approved by the minister of international relations of the government, dr. nkosazana dlamini-zuma.......

385	I think this intervention is not genuine, but a political ploy by MEC because in March Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma turned down an earlier decision by COGTA in the province to place the municipality under administration.	Ke akanya gore tsereganyo eno ga e se boammaaruri, mme ke leano la la ga MEC ka gonne ka kgwedi ya Mopitlwe Ngaka Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma  o ganetsane le tshwetso ya COGTA mo porofenseng ya go baya mmasepala ka fa tlase ga tsamaiso.	i think this announcement is not true, and it is a plan of the mec because in the month of february, dr. nkosazana dlamini zuma disagreed with the cogta decision in the province to put the municipality under administration.
386	Dlamini- Zuma instead recommended that the provincial government intervene with Section 139 1A which means they could monitor, guide, and assist the municipality.	Dlamini- Zuma, ka jalo o gakolotse gore puso ya porofense e ikamanye le Karolo 139 1A e e kayang gore ba ka baya leitlho, ba kaela, le go thusa mmasepala.	dlamini-zuma, therefore, urged the provincial government to familiarize itself with section 139 1a, which allows them to intervene, supervise, and assist municipalities.
387	But Cogta in KZN did not do that.	Fela  COGTA  ya kwa KZN ga ya dira  jalo.	however, the cogta in kzn does not operate like that.
388	Yes, we did get a disclaimer audit outcome, but the reasons for that, the previous senior managers, when they left they deliberately took with them crucial information which was required for auditing purposes, says Mayor Lindokuhle Shabalala.	Ee, re fitlhetse dipoelo tsa boruni tsa go sa dire kopotuelo, fela mabaka a seo, batsamaisi ba ba fetileng, fa ba ka tsamaya ba tsamaile le tshedimosetso e e botlhokwa le bona e e neng e tlhokega mo maikaelelong a go runa, ga bua Lindokuhle Shabalala.	yes, we have reached the results of the broom not making a complaint, but the reasons for this, the past managers, when they left, they also left with important information that was needed in the running of the broom, said lindokuhle shabalala.
389	Nquthu municipality threatens to take COGTA to court	Mmasepala wa Nquthu o dira matshosetsi a go isa COGTA kwa kgotlatshekelo	the municipality of nquthu is making preparations to take cogta to court.
390	The IFP in KwaZulu-Natal has accused Hlomuka of helping the African National Congress (ANC) to run the municipality through the back door by placing it under administration.

391	Provincial party chairperson, Thamsanqa Ntuli says the ANC is hell-bent on running the Nquthu Municipality even though they lost elections in the area.	Modulasetulo wa Lekoko la Porofense, Thamsanqa Ntuli o rile ANC e batla go tsamaisa Mmasepala wa Nquthu le fa ba latlhegetswe ke ditlhopho mo lefelong leo.	the chairperson of the provincial executive committee, thamsanqa ntuli, said the anc wants to run the nquthu municipality even though they were defeated in the elections in that area.
392	We are all quite aware that the IFP and the ANC are working well in the City of Johannesburg but here in KZN it’s a different story.	Rotlhe re itse gore sentle gore IFP le ANC ba dira sentle mo Toropong ya Johannesburg fela  mo KZN ke kgang e e farologaneng.	we all know that the ifp and anc are doing well in the city of johannesburg, but in kzn it's a different story.
393	Hence you see the agenda against all our municipalities in the province of KZN.	Ke ka foo o bonang lenaanetema le le kgatlhanong  le bommasepala ba rona botlhe mo porofenseng ya KZN.	this is where you see the mural that is related to all our municipal mothers in the kzn province.
394	We are quite very concerned with the behaviour of COGTA and MEC for COGTA who actually is allowing the narrow agenda of ANC councillors in Nquthu to be guiding the activities of COGTA, it’s quite very unfortunate.	Re tshwenyegile thata ka maitshwaro a COGTA le Mokhuduthamaga wa COGTA  yo a letlelelang lenaanetema la bakhansela ba ANC  mo Nquthu go kaela ditiro tsa COGTA, se se swabisa thata.	we are deeply concerned about the actions of cogta and the cogta minister who is neglecting the issue of anc councilors in nquthu to focus on cogta's duties, which is very disappointing.
395	The IFP is also unhappy with the ANC after it named one of its regional structures in the far north of the province after its late freedom fighter, Nobleman Mzala Nxumalo.	IFP e swabisitse gape ke ANC morago ga go neela leina la nngwe ya ditheo tsa kgaolo mo porofenseng go ya kwa bokone, leina la molwela kgololesego, moswi Nobleman Mzala Nxumalo.	the ifp has again been criticized by the anc after giving another name of the heroes of the region in the province to the north, the name of the freedom fighter, the late nobleman mzala nxumalo.
396	It also says the move would regress reconciliatory talks between the two parties spearheaded by leaders of both parties at the national level.	E rile, kgato e, e tlaa busetsa kwa morago dipuisano tsa itshwarelano magareng ga makoko a mabedi a a neng a bolotswa ke baeteledipele ba makoko a ka bobedi kwa maemong a bosetšhaba.	indeed, this step will pave the way for reconciliation discussions between the two communities that were previously polarized by the leaders of both communities at the international level.
397	Deputy President David Mabuza has assured military veterans that government does not have hard cash to give to military veterans but has money to take care of their social and health needs.	Motlatsamoporesitente David Mabuza o netefaditse bagaka ba sesole gore puso ga e na madi  mo seatleng go neela bagaka ba Sesole fela puso e na le madi a go tlhokomela ditlhokego  tsa bona tsa loago le ditlhokego tsa boitekanelo.	deputy president david mabuza has assured the soldiers that the government does not lack funds to only give to the soldiers, the government has funds to cater for their welfare needs and security needs.
398	He says the problem was with the Department of Defence and Military Veterans which lacked direction to attend to their plight.	A re bothata bo ne bo na le Lefapha la Tshireletso le Bagaka ba Sesole, ka go tlhoka tsamaiso ya go tshwaragana le mathata a bona.	the problem was with the department of defense and the army doctors, due to a lack of coordination and their problems.
399	Addressing a group of military veterans, Mabuza says things will start to work out properly because a director-general of the department has been appointed.	Fa a ne a ema setlhopha sa bagaka ba sesole ka lefoko, Mabuza o rile dilo di tlaa simolola go tsamaya sentle ka gonne go tlhophilwe Mokaedi-Kakaretso wa Lefapha.	when he addressed the group of school doctors, mabuza said things will start going well because a director-general for the department has been appointed.

621	It is the highest law in the land.	Ke molao o o kwa godimo mo lefatsheng.	it is the highest law in the world.

630	However, this clause is currently being amended by the Ad Hoc Committee to Amend Section 25 of the Constitution to allow the Expropriation of Land Without Compensation.	Le gale, polelo ya semolao e a tlhabololwa ke Komiti ya nakwana go tlhabolola Karolo 25 ya Molaotheo go letla tlhakolothoto ya lefatshe kwa ntle ga tuelo.	however, the language of the bill is being developed by the ad hoc committee to amend section 25 of the constitution to allow for land expropriation without compensation.
631	The Section 25 amendment is currently being done through the Constitution’s 18th Amendment Bill.	Tlhabololo ya Karolo 25 ga jaana e dirwa ka tsamaiso ya Molaotheo wa Molaotlhomo o o Tlhabolotsweng wa bo 18.	the amendment of section 25 is done in accordance with the procedure of the amended constitution of the 18th.

650	Just two months after its implementation, the Multi-Party Democracy Fund is under scrutiny.	Fela dikgwedi di le pedi morago ga tsenyotirisong ya yona, Multi-Party Democracy Fund e ka fa tlase ga letlole la tlhatlhobo.	just two months after its launch, the multi-party democracy fund could be under the threat of collapse.
651	ActionSA claims that the IEC is in violation of its Constitutional obligations with regards to the fund.	ActionSA e tlhalosa gore IEC e gataka ditlamelo tsa molaotheo malebana le letlole le.	actionsa explains that the iec is violating constitutional rights related to the election.
652	It accuses the commission of actively raising funds for the fourteen political parties in the National Assembly and excluding political parties like ActionSA, that can only be represented after the 2024 national elections.	E latofatsa khomišene ka go tlhola e koleka madi a go direla makoko  a sepolotiki a le lesomenne ka mo Kokoanong ya Bosetšhaba mme e sa akaretse makoko a sepolotiki a a jaaka ActionSA, e ka nnang le kemedi morago ga ditlhopho tsa bosetšhaba tsa 2024.	it proposes the commission be funded by levying political parties with 50 or more seats in the national assembly, excluding political parties like actionsa, which could be a remedy after the 2024 national elections.
653	ActionSA has written to the IEC CEO Sy Mamabolo and Deputy CEO Masego Sheburi to demand that the IECs fundraising for the multi-party democracy fund be ceased immediately.	ActionSA e kwaletse moeteledipele wa IEC, Sy Mamabolo le Motlatsa Modulasetulo Masego Sheburi  gore kgobokanyo ya matlole ya IEC go Multi-Party Democracy e emiswe ka bonako.	actionsa has written to the ceo of the iec, sy mamabolo and deputy chairperson masego sheburi that the iec's merger with multi-party democracy is done unfairly.
654	The IEC made the startling confession that it has been actively soliciting funds for the 14 political parties that are represented in the National Assembly, who already received billions in public funding every year from taxpayers.	IEC dirile boipobolo jwa gore e ne e le matlhagatlhaga go kopa matlole go makoko a sepolotiki a le 14 a a emetsweng mo Kokoanong Bosetšhaba,ao a setseng a amogetse dibilione mo kolekong ya matlole phatlalatsa ngwaga le ngwaga go tswa go baduedi ba lekgetho.	the iec conducted an election to request votes from the 14 political parties participating in the global village, which have already received billions in the annual collection of votes from election voters.

Ga go itshokelwe gore ditiro tsa IEC di tsweletse maemo a ga jaana mo dipolotiking segolo fa Maaforikaborwa a retelelwa ke go dira jalo, go bua mmueledi wa ActionSA Lerato Ngobeni.	it is not surprising that the iec's actions continue in this manner in south african politics, especially when south africans are used to it, says actionsa spokesperson lerato ngobeni.

658	The Fund is critical to combat corruption, by requiring political parties and donors to be transparent.	Letlole le ka fedisa tlolomolao ka go gapeletsa makoko a sepolotiki le ba ba thusang ka madi go nna mo pepeneneng.	the swamp can alleviate poverty by attracting political figures and those who assist financially to be in the spotlight.
659	Democracy is expensive and the fiscus alone cannot provide complete financial support to political parties especially under the current severe fiscal constraints.	Puso ya temokerasi e a tura mme le lefapha la matlole le le nosi le ka se kgone go tlamela ka tshegetso ya matlole go makoko a sepolotiki, segolobogolo ka fa tlase ga maemo feteletseng.	the heart of democracy is education, and no branch of education can thrive without the support of politics, especially under certain conditions.
660	To ensure we continue to enjoy a vibrant, thriving and robust multiparty democracy we hope that this Fund will provide an easy and Hands off channel through which corporate entities, individuals and other organisations can contribute funds to parties without having to engage directly with them or needing to declare these separately, says IEC vice-chairperson Janet Love.	Go netefatsa gore re tswelela ka go itumelela matlhagatlhaga, boitumelo le tshegetso e e maatla ya makokomantsi re solofela gore letlole leno le tlaa tlamela ka bonolo le go bula diatla gore ditlamo tsa kgwebo, batho le mekgatlho e mengwe e ka latlhela matlole go makoko a mangwe ntle le go nna le seabe ka tlhamalalo le bona kgotsa go  leka go itlhalosa, go bua Motlatsamodulasetulo wa IEC Janet Lerato.	to ensure that we continue to enjoy the benefits, joy and strong support of the grassroots, we hope that this lottery will easily open doors for business opportunities, people and other groups to pour pots into other areas without having to participate in corruption or even try to explain, said iec deputy chairperson janet lerato.
661	The party has since written to the commissions CEO and Deputy CEO, demanding that the fund ceases with immediate effect and that money deposited be returned to the donors.

974	When offered the opportunity to respond on the matter of the special plea, Thales defence led by Advocate Barry Roux, humorously responded that they were merely passengers in the matter.	Fa a ne a newa tšhono ya go arabela kopo e e kgethegileng, tshireletso ya ga Thale e e eteletsweng pele ke moatlhodi Barry Roux, o arabile ka metlae gore bona e ne e le bapalami fela mo kgannyeng eno	when he was given the opportunity to respond to the specific request, thale's defense, led by advocate barry roux, argued that these were just players in this game.
975	But he says the defence has a feat ahead of them to argue the special plea.	Mme a re go na le phitlhelo e e kwa pele ga bona go ganetsa kopo e.	the mother said there is evidence in front of them to deny the request.
976	Once the special plea is determined, only then is the expected of the accused to formally then plea in terms of the lets call it the general type of pleas namely guilty or not guilty.	Fa boikuelo jo bo kgethegileng bo ka bontsha maikaelelo, ke yona fela nako e ka yona molatofadiwa a ka solofelwang go ikarabela ka semmuso mo tatofatsong ka mabaka, mme e re tla e bitsa ka mofuta wa kopo, e leng molato kgotsa e se molato.	if a particular conviction can show intent, it is the only time a convicted person can be expected to appeal to the government for mercy in sentencing for reasons, and we will call it by a type of request, whether it is a crime or not a crime.
977	In this instance, not guilty as he has done.	Mo lebakeng le, ga a ipona molato.	in this situation, he does not see any wrongdoing.
978	It is not uncommon to enter into a special plea  the one they have raised in section 106.	Ga go makatse go tsena mo kopong e e kgethegileng, e le nngwe. Yona e e tlhagisitsweng mo karolo 106.	it is not surprising to enter a specially selected hole, one of them. it is highlighted in section 106.

981	But the grounds that was advanced by Dali Mpofu on behalf of Zuma is that Billy Downer will not be objective and independent in his prosecution of this matter because at one stage filed an affidavit on behalf of the Democratic Alliance in a matter that was before court and based on that they say he is not independent.

982	Curlewis explains the process that will follow once Judge Koen hands down judgement- possibly not immediately- on the special plea.

983	If the defence is correct in their special plea and if the court upholds it and once again I repeat personally from what I have seen in the case law, and in our law journals and articles and authorities on this issue they will not be successful, but let assume for argument sake they are successful then they will also advance next prey before the court that is to the matter then be struck from the roll which will not happen because they have already pleaded not guilty in all those charges yesterday and if one reads section 106 specifically not talking about 106	Fa tshireletso e nepile ka kopo ya bona ya go ikarabela, mme kantoro e e tshegetsa, ke a ipoeletsa, go ya ka se ke se boneng mo molaong wa rona wa makwalopaka le diathekele le balaodi ba kgang e,  di ka se atlege, fela a re akanye gore di tlile go atlega ka go tswelela pele batla lebelela kgang nngwe kwa kgotlhatshekelo e e amanang le ntlha, mme morago ba tlhaselwe go tswa go lekwalo le le ka se diregeng ka ntlha ya gore sa molato mo dilatofatsong tsa maabane gape fa mongwe a buisa thata karolo 106 e seng go bua ka 106.	if their request for protection was denied, and the office supports it, i suspect, based on what i have seen in our history of lawsuits and contracts and the authors of the case, they may not succeed, but let's assume they will succeed by continuing to look at another case in the context of the issue, and then they were forced to withdraw from the letter that could not be done because of the accused in yesterday's trials again if someone strongly raises section 106 instead of talking about 106.
984	The 1 H special plea I’m talking about the ordinary pleads of guilty or not guilty and this instance not guilty then the court must make a finding after such a plea only the court can do it, so no the matter will proceed after the 19.	Kopa ya 1 H, ke bua ka di kopo tsa “ke molato” kgotsa “ga ke molato” mme mo nakong e, “ga ke molato, kgotlhatshekelo e tshwanetse ya tlhagisa phitlhelelo ya yona morago ga kopo e. Ke kgotlhatshekelo fela e e ka kgonang go dira seo, ka jalo, kgang e tlaa tswelela morago ga di 19.	"referring to rule 1 h, i'm talking about the pleas of ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" and at this time, ""not guilty"", the defense must present its evidence after the plea. it is only the defense that can do this, therefore, the case will continue after the 19th."
