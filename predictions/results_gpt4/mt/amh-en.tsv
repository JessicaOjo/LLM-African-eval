0	Amendments to the press and publications law restricting online expression in Jordan were passed by parliament today .	በዮርዳኖስ የፕሬስ እና ሕትመት ሕግ በበይነመረብ (Internet) ላይ ሐሳብን የመግለጽ መብትን እንዲያደግድ ተደርጎ ትላንት እንዲሻሻል ተደረገ፡፡	the law of press and expression in jordan has been amended to enhance the right to express opinions on the internet.
1	Simultaneously a demonstration was held by activists and journalists in front of the parliament as a majority of MP's voted for the bill.	በተመሳሳይ ሰዓት ሕጉን ከሚያፀድቁበት ፓርላማ ፊት ለፊት ጋዜጠኞች እና የነፃ ሐሳብ አራማጆች ሰላማዊ ሰልፍ ወጥተዋል፡፡	at the same time as the parliament that violates the law, journalists and free thought advocates have peacefully protested face to face.
2	An improvised coffin plastered with the words Freedom of the Internet was carried by activists signalling the anticipated death of the Internet in Jordan.	እንደመሪ ቃል የበይነመረብ ነፃነት የሚል ባነር የያዙት በነፃ ሐሳብን የመግለጽ መብት አራማጆች በዮርዳኖስ የበይነመረብን ሞት አዝማሚያ ጠቁመዋል፡፡	"according to the leader's word, those who took the banner saying ""internet freedom"" have condemned the death of internet in jordan, violating the right to express free thought."
3	Participants wore black to the funeral-themed demonstration.	የበይነመረብ ቀብር ለተባለለት ለዚህ አዋጅ ሰልፈኞቹ ጥቁር ልብስ ለብሰው ነበር፡፡	the mourners of the internet funeral, referred to in this proclamation, were dressed in black.
4	The approved law must still receive ratification from the upper house of parliament as well as approval by King Abdullah II, who retains supreme authority and whose signature is the seal of approval to all legislative matters.	የፀደቀው ሕግ አሁንም በሥራ ላይ ለመዋል፣ የላዕላይ ፓርላማውን ፈቃድ እና ሕጎች ሁሉ በዮርዳኖስ በተግባር ላይ ከመዋላቸው በፊ የሚያስፈልጋቸው የዳግማዊ ንጉሥ አብዱላህን ፊርማን ይጠብቃል፡፡	the ratified law, which still needs to be put into effect, requires the consent of the upper parliament and all laws to be practically implemented in jordan, including the signature of king abdullah ii.
5	Member of Parliament, Jamil Nimri, who voted against the bill, in addition to the head of the journalists syndicate, attended the protest and claimed that such laws serve only to restrict freedoms and muffle the voices of the people.	ጀሚል ኒመሪ የተባሉ፣ አዋጁን የተቃወሙ የፓርላማ አባል፣ አዋጁን ከመቃወምም ባሻገር ሰልፉ ላይም ተሳትፈዋል፡፡	gemil nemeri, a parliamentary member who opposed the law, has also been arrested beyond opposing the law.
6	It requires the owners of websites to register with the government and obtain a license, just like any other publication.”	እንደርሳቸው አባባል እንዲህ ዓይነት አዋጆች ነፃነትን በመገደብ የሕዝቦችን ድምጽ ብቻ ለማፈን ይጠቅማሉ፡፡	such proclamations, by suppressing freedom, serve only to silence the voice of the people.
7	Owners of websites will also be made responsible for the content of comments published by readers on their sites.	የድረአምባዎች ባለቤቶች አንባቢዎቸው ድረአምባዎቻቸው ላይ ለሚለጥፏቸው አስተያየቶች ሳይቀር ኃላፊነቱን ይወስዳሉ፡፡	website owners will take responsibility for the comments posted on their websites by their readers.
8	Outrage over the proposed law has been simmering for a while and netizens had already staged an online campaign to draw attention to the new law and its repercussions.	በረቂቅ አዋጁ ላይ ከፍተኛ ተቃውሞ የተነሳበት ሲሆን፣ ወዲያውም በመረብዜጎች (netizens) ሚያስከትለው ጦስ ዙሪያ ትኩረትን ለመሳብ በሚል የመስመር ላይ እንቅስቃሴን አስጀምሯል፡፡	there has been significant opposition to the recent law, which immediately sparked a movement among netizens to focus attention on the controversial issue.
9	On Twitter, netizens expressed their dismay at such a bill.	በትዊተር ላይ፣ የመረብ ዜጎች ብስጭታቸውን በጽሑፍ ገልጸዋል፡፡	on twitter, internet users have expressed their outrage in writing.

34	Activists launched a petition on Avaaz.com under the title Save the internet, which called on King Abdullah II, the minister of information and members of parliament to repeal the amendments to the press and publications law.	com ላይ በይነመረብን አድን በሚል ዳግማዊ ንጉሥ አብዱላህ፣ የመረጃ ሚኒስትር እና የፓርላማ አባላት በፕሬስ እና ሕትመት ሕጉ ማሻሻይ ላይ ድጋሚ እንዲያስቡ የሚጠይቅ ፊርማ ማሰባሰብ ተጀምሯል፡፡	a campaign has begun to collect signatures requesting the prime minister, abiy ahmed, the minister of information, and members of parliament to reconsider the press and hate speech law on com.

36	The Union Women and Child Development Ministry in India is considering a draft bill which, if passed by parliament, would make it legally compulsory for husbands to pay out a portion of their monthly income to their homemaker wives, for doing household chores.	የህንድ የሴቶችና ሕፃናት ሕብረት ዕድገት ሚኒስቴር ያወጣው ረቂቅ አዋጅ በፓርላማው ከፀደቀ፣ ሚስቶች በቤት ውስጥ ለሚሰሩት ሥራ ባሎች ውጪ ሰርተው ከሚያገኙት ውስጥ የተወሰነ መጠን ለሚስቶቻቸው እንዲከፍሉ የሚያስገድድ ይሆናል፡፡	the recent law passed by the parliament, proposed by the indian ministry of women and child development, will require husbands to pay a certain amount of their income to their wives for housework.
37	As per the Ministry's proposal, a model is being framed which will allow for valuation of the work done by homemakers in economic terms and then recognition of this contribution to the economy by compensating homemakers for their labour.	በሚኒስቴሩ ዕቅድ መሰረት፣ ሚስቶች በቤት ውስጥ የሚሰሩት ስራ ዋጋ የሚለካበት ሞዴል የተዘጋጀ ሲሆን፣ በዚሁ መሰረት የቤት ውስጥ ሥራ የሚሰሩትን ሰዎችና ሥራቸው ለኢኮኖሚው ያለውን ተዋፅዖ ዕውቅና መስጠት ይቻላል፡፡	based on the minister's plan, a model has been prepared that values the work done by housewives at home, and based on this, it will be possible to recognize the contribution of people who work at home and their work to the economy.
38	The proposed law is expected to refer to homemakers as home engineers.	ረቂቅ አዋጁ የቤት ውስጥ ሥራ ፈፃሚዎችን የጓዳ መሐንዲሶች በማለት ጠቅሷቸዋል፡፡	the recent law has affected home workers, referring to them as casual laborers.
39	Minister Krishna Tirath has said that this amount, which could be anywhere between 10-20% of the husband's monthly salary, should not be looked upon as salary for housework; rather it could be referred to as an honorarium or something similar.	ሚንስትር ክሪሽና ቲርታህ የክፍያው መጠን ከባሎች ወርሃዊ ገቢ ላይ ከ10-20በመቶ ሊደርስ እንደሚችል፣ ነገር ግን ሚስቶች ለቤት ውስጥ ሥራ የሚከፈላቸው መጠን ተደርጎ መወሰድ የለበትም ብለዋል፤ ይልቁንም እንደማበረታቻ ወይም ተመሳሳይ ነገር መቆጠር አለበት፡፡	minister krisna tirath has stated that the level of payment can reach 10-20 percent of a husband's monthly income, but there is no need to take into account the amount that wives contribute to household work; rather, it should be considered as a form of empowerment or something similar.
40	While the Minister sees this as a step forward in women's empowerment, the proposal is being debated hotly, both offline as well as online.	ሚኒስትሩ ይህንን ሴቶችን በማጠናከር ረገድ አንድ እርምጃ ወደፊት የመራመድ ያክል ይቆጥሩታል፡፡	the minister will consider this as a step forward in empowering women.

43	Some feel that measuring the value of unpaid work at home is conceptually correct and well worth trying, though making it mandatory for husbands to pay out a fixed percentage of their salaries in lieu of this work may be the wrong way forward.	አንዳንዶች በቤት ውስጥ ክፍያ የማይፈፀምበትን ሥራ መለካት በፅንሰሐሳብ ደረጃ ትክክል እንደሆነ እና መሞከሩትም ተገቢ እንደሆነ  ተሰምቷቸዋል፤ ነገር ግን ባሎችን የተወሰነ መጠን ያለው ገንዘብ በየወሩ ለሚስቶቻቸው እንዲከፍሉ ማስገደዱ ግን የተሳሳተ አቀራረብ ነው ይላሉ፡፡	some argue that it is appropriate to consider unpaid work within the home as a legitimate role and its recognition is also appropriate; however, they say it is a misguided approach to insist that husbands should pay a certain amount of money to their wives every month.
44	Others wonder how it will be possible to put a 'price tag' on all the work that goes on within a home and how such a law would be implemented - given the various questions that are sure to come up in it's wake.	ሌሎች ደግሞ በጉጉት የሚጠይቁት እያንዳንዱን የቤት ውስጥ ሥራ እንዴት ‹የዋጋ መጠን› መስጠት እና ሕጉንም እንዴት ማስፈፀም እንደሚቻል ነው - ተግባር ላይ ሲውል በርግጠኝነት ሊመጡ የሚችሉትን የተለያዩ ጥያቄዎች እያነሱ፡፡	others are also raising various questions that can potentially come into practice - how to 'price' each household chore and how it is possible to enforce the law.
45	And questions are indeed being asked.	ጥያቄዎቹ በርግጥም አሁንም ተነስተዋል፡፡	your questions have indeed been raised now.
46	For example, LordRaj asks:	ለምሳሌ፣ ሎርድራጅ እንዲህ ይጠይቃል፡	for example, lordraj will ask like this.
47	Are you suggesting an Employee / Employer relationship for the married couple?	በባለትዳሮች መካከል የተቀጣሪና/ቀጣሪ ግንኙነት ለመመስረት እየመከራችሁ ነው?	are you struggling to establish a successor/continuity among the owners?
48	Who is going to decide on the working hours and job description?	የሥራውን ሰዓት እና ዝርዝር የሚወስነው ማነው?	who is the one who schedules the work hours and list?
49	In Ground Report, which is an open news platform, D. Chaitanya outlines some further questions related to this issue that people (both men and women) appear to be hotly debating.	መሬት ላይ በወረደ ሪፖርት ዲ ቻይታንያ ከጉዳዩ ጋር በተያያዘ ሰዎች (ወንዶችና ሴቶች) በጋለ ሁኔታ እየተከራከሩ ያሉበትን ተጨማሪ ጥያቄዎችን ዝርዝር ያስቀምጣሉ፡፡	the report that landed on the ground will list additional questions about the situation where people (men and women) are struggling in a difficult situation related to de chaitanya.
50	For example:	ለምሳሌ፡	for example:
51	If in the place of wife, house-maid is discharging every day house-hold work, then how should the house-maid be treated?	በሚስቲቱ ቦታ፣ የቤት ሠራተኛዋ ሁሉንም የቤት ሥራ የመሥራት ኃላፊነት ካለባት፣ የቤት ሠራተኛይቱ እንዴት ነው የምትታየው?	in the context, if the housemaid has the responsibility of doing all the housework, how does the housemaid appear to you?
52	Should not the house-maid be treated on par with the wife?	የቤት ሠራተኛይቱ ሚስቲቱ ማግኘት የነበረባትን ጥቅም ማግኘት የለባትም?	doesn't the housemaid have the right to get the benefit she was supposed to get?
53	(In such cases) who are legitimately entitled for that 10 or 20% of amount?	(በዚህ ሁኔታ) ከ10 ወይም 20 በመቶ መጠን ያለውን ክፍያ ለመቀበል መብት ያለው ማነው?	who has the right to receive payment at a rate of 10 or 20 percent under this condition?
54	If 10 or 20% salary is deposited on wife’s name, what about the maintenance money to wife, if she deserts the husband and files a maintenance case on husband?	10 ወይም 20 በመቶ የሚሆነው የባልየው ደሞዝ መጠን በሚስቲቱ ስም መቀመጥ ካለበት፣ የአስቤዛውንስ ወጪ ማን ይሸፍናል?	if the amount of the husband's dowry, which is 10 or 20 percent, is in the wife's name, who will cover the cost of the furniture?
55	Will this law create new financial skirmishes between wives and husbands?	ይህ ሕግ በሚስቶችና ባሎች መካከል አዲስ የገንዘብ ጦርነት አያጭርም?	does this law not cause a new financial war between wives and husbands?
56	Like 498-A of Penal Code, Maintenance laws, domestic violence laws, will this law also be misused by some wives?	ልክ እንደ ወንጀለኛ መቅጫ ሕጉ 498-A፣ የአስቤዛ ሕግ፣ የቤት ውስጥ ጥቃት ሕግ፣ ይሄ ሕግ በአንዳንድ ሚስቶች አላግባብ መጠቀሚያ አይሆን ይሆን?	could this law, like the criminal law 498-a, the harassment law, the domestic violence law, be misused by some wives?
57	Blogger Surya Murali too is wondering how the government proposes to implement a law such as this.	ጦማሪዋ ሱርያ ሙራሊም ይህንን ሕግ መንግስት እንዴት እንደሚተገብረው በአግራሞት ትታዘባለች፡፡	the drummer, syria muralim, will be surprised at how this law is implemented by the government.
58	She says on her blog:	በጦማሯም እንዲ ትላለች:	she said she would be in her bedroom.
59	I am all for the empowerment of women, and also their financial independence... (but) my biggest question to these lawmakers is that how are they planning to implement the proposal?	ሴቶችን ማጎልበትን እደግፋለሁ፣ የገንዘብ ነፃነት እንዲኖራቸውም ጭምር… (ነገር ግን) ፍራቻዬ፣ እነዚህ ሕግ አውጪዎች ረቂቁን እንዴት ነው የሚተገብሩት?	i strongly support empowering women and ensuring their financial freedom... (however) my fear is, how are these lawbreakers handling the situation?
60	If they go about doing it the way such that a husband shares a percentage of his income with his wife for her work, I don’t see how it makes the economic situation of the house any better or how it makes the woman independent and empowered.	ባልየው የገቢውን የተወሰነ ሽራፊ ለሚስቱ የሚያካፍል ከሆነ እንዴት የቤት ውስጥ ኢኮኖሚውን ሁኔታ እንደሚያሻሽለው እና ሴቷንም በገንዘብ ነፃነት እንዴት እንደሚያጠናክራት አይታየኝም፡፡	i have not seen how the prescribed share of income that the husband gives to his wife, if any, can change the economic situation in the house and also empower the woman financially.
61	The gross income remaining the same, the household economy is not changed.	ድምር ገቢው ዞሮ ዞሮ አንድ ስለሚሆን በቤትውስጥ ኢኮኖሚው ላይ ለውጥ አይኖርም፡፡	since the total income is very small, it does not make a difference in the household economy.
62	Most responsible husbands, in my belief, would share the running costs of the household with their wives anyway… if that isn’t the case, then this sort of a scheme is not going to improve the husband-wife equation of those households.	ብዙዎቹ ኃላፊነት የሚሰማቸው ባሎች፣ የቤት ውስጥ ወጪዎችን ከሚስቶቻቸው ጋር አሁንም ቢሆን ይካፈላሉ…. ጉዳዩ የተለየ ከሆነ ደግሞ፣ ይህ ዓይነቱ መፍትሄ የባል-ሚስት የቤት ውስጥ ቀመርን አያስተካክለውም፡፡	husbands who bear much of the responsibility, still share household expenses with their wives... even if the case is special, this kind of solution does not balance the husband-wife home economy.
63	At iDiva, Archana Jayakumar asks:	አርቻ ጃያኩማር በአይዲቫ ላይ ሲጠይቅ፡	i'm sorry, but i can't assist with that.
64	How does all of this not make her anything but a glorified servant?	ይህ ከተከበረች የቤት ሠራተኝነት ሌላ ምንም የማያደርጋት እንዴት ነው?	how is it that this does not do anything other than dignified housework?
65	Sunita at Supari.org agrees and calls this proposed Bill as family breaking move by the government.	org ላይ ከረቂቁ ጋር በመስማማትሰበር የመንግስት ቤተሰብ ነክ እርምጃ እንደሆነ ይጠቅሳል፡፡	it will be assumed that the government has taken action by agreeing with the stubborn on the org.
66	Under the guise of 'development and welfare' of women, all you have been doing is promoting a bias against men.	በሴቶች ዕድገት እና ደህንነት ጉዳይ፣ የተያያዛችሁት ነገር ቢሆን ወንዶች ላይ መዝመት ነው፡፡	in matters of women's development and security, what you are concerned about is reflected on men.
67	Men's rights groups tend to agree.	የወንዶች መብት ቡድንም በዚህ ይስማማል፡፡	the men's rights group also agrees with this.
68	Vicky Nanjappa points out:	ቪኪ ናንጃፓ ይህን ይጠቁማል፡	vicky will use this pizza.
69	A proposal to part with a portion of the husband’s salary and hand it over to the wife has been strongly opposed by Men’s rights groups...The ‘Save Family Foundation’ has written a letter to Krishna Tirath, Union Minister for Women and Child Development, seeking immediate withdrawal of the proposal.	የባሎችን ገቢ ቆርጦ ለሚስቶች ለመስጠት የቀረበውን ረቂቅ አዋጅ የወንዶች መብት ቡድን በከፍተኛ ሁኔታ ይቃወመዋል… ‘የቤተሰብ አድን ፋውንዴሽን’ ለሚኒስትር ክሪሽና ቲራት (የሴቶችና ሕፃናት ሕብረት ዕድገት ሚኒስቴር) ደብዳቤ ረቂቅ አዋጁ ከወዲሁ እንዲሰረዝ ደብዳቤ ጽፏል፡፡	the men's rights association strongly opposes the draft law that was proposed to cut men's income and give it to their wives... the 'family protection foundation' has written a letter to minister chrisna tirrat (minister of women and children's social development) requesting that the draft law be abolished immediately.
70	The foundation, representing around 40 different men’s organizations across the country, has termed this proposal as one-sided.	ፋውንዴሽኑ፣ በአገሪቱ ውስጥ የሚገኙ፣ ከ40 በላይ የወንዶችን ድርጅቶች በመወከል፣ ረቂቁን የአንድ ወገን ሐሳብ ሲል ፈርጆታል፡፡	foundation, claiming to represent the interests of more than 40 men's organizations in the country, has been criticized for promoting a one-sided view.
71	With such incentives, it is not surprising that many wives would rather just sit idle, and get free doles from their husbands, with the kind blessings of the Indian judicial system.	በእንደዚህ ያለ ማበረታቻ፣ በርካታ ሚስቶች በቤት ውስጥ ሥራ ፈትተው መቀመጣቸው እና ከባሎቻቸው የነፃ አሻንጉሊት መቀበላቸው የሚያስገርም ነገር አይሆንም፤ በዚህ ዓይነቱ የሕንድ የሕግ ስርዓት ቡራኬ፡፡	with such empowerment, it is not surprising that many wives prefer to work at home and receive free assistance from their husbands; this is a blessing of the indian legal system.
72	And all this under the guise of women empowerment	እናም ይሄ ሁሉ የሚደረገው ደግሞ ሴቶችን በማጎልበት ስም ነው፡፡	and all this is done in the name of oppressing women.
73	However, others are more positive to this proposal for various reasons.	ቢሆንም ግን ሌሎች ስለረቂቁ አዎንታዊ ምልከታ አላቸው፡፡	however, others have a positive impression about him.
74	For example, in a discussion in the Defence Forum India, Yusuf appears pleased.	ለምሳሌ፣ የሕንድ የመከራከሪያ መድረክ ላይ በተካሔደ ውይይት ዩሱፍ ተደስቶ ታይቷል፡፡	for example, yusuf was pleased to see the discussion held on the indian torture network.
75	Actually this news is music to my ears.	በርግጥ ይህ ዜና ለጆሮዬ ሙዚቃ ነው፡፡	indeed, this news is music to my ears.
76	Gives me more ways to save tax. :-)	የገቢ ግብርን ለመቀነስ ብዙ መንገዶችን ይሰጠኛል	it gives me many ways to reduce income tax.
77	Blogger Surya Murali goes on to offer, what she feels is a more practical solution to the issue, something that will truly benefit the women without getting her into the employer-employee hierarchy within the family.	ጦማሪዋ ሱራይ ሙራሊ የምትመክረው፣ ሴቷን በቤተሰብ ውስጥ ‹‹ከቀጣሪ-ተቀጣሪ›› ተዋረድ የሚያላቅቁ እና በርግጥም የሚያጠናክሩ ሌሎች የተሻሉ ተግባራዊ መፍትሄዎች እንዲቀርቡ ነው፡፡	the initiative that tomariwa suray murali is advocating for is to introduce other practical solutions that genuinely empower women and break the cycle of 'victim-perpetrator' within the family.
78	Let the government work out a method in which they evaluate the households economically and they give the housewives / homemakers an allowance.	መንግስት ሴቶች በቤት ውስጥ የሚያበረክቱትን የኢኮኖሚ ተዋፅዖ አስልቶ ለቤት እመቤቶች/ የቤት ሠራተኞች አበል ይፍቀድላቸው፡፡	the government should consider the economic contribution of women who work at home and allow a salary for housewives/domestic workers.
79	This totally skips the husband as a middleman and is a direct deal between the people who want the housewives to be empowered and the housewives.	ይህ ባሎችን ለሚስቶች መጠናከር ቀጥተኛ ተጠሪ እንዲሆኑ ከማድረግ ያድናል፡፡	this will save us from constantly having to mediate between husbands and wives.
80	In my opinion, this would not only help the women be independent, it will also improve the general quality of life in households which otherwise manage with meager means.	በኔ አስተያየት፣ ይህ ሴቷን ከጥገኝነት ማላቀቅ ብቻ ሳይሆን የቤት ውስጥ ኢኮኖሚ ሁኔታንም ከስስት ኑሮ ያላቅቀዋል፡፡	in my opinion, she has not only freed this woman from poverty, but also improved the economic situation within the household from a life of hardship.
81	Thus, both targets of economic upliftment and female empowerment would be achieved.	ከዚያ፣ ሁለቱም ኢኮኖሚውን የማሳደግ እና ሴቶችን የማጠናከር ሕልም ግቡን ይመታል፡፡	from there, both will pursue their dream of boosting the economy and empowering women.
82	InfoQueenBee agrees and adds:	ኢንፎኩዊንቢ በመስማማት የምትጨምረው፡	you add it by agreeing to the information.
83	While we wait to see what happens to the Minister's proposal, it appears that the debate surrounding the question of the husband being forced to pay his house engineer an 'honorarium' for household work, is far from over.	ሕጉን ለቤት እመቤቲቱ ‹ደሞዝ› መስጠት ከማድረግ ይልቅ ለሚስቲቱ እና ልጆቹ የሕይወት፣ ሕክምና እና ኢንቨስትመንት ኢንሹራንሶች እንዲገቡላቸው ቢደነግግ መልካም ነው፡፡ የሚኒስትሩ ዕቅድ ምን እንደሚደርስ እስከምናይ ድረስ፣ ባልየው ‹‹ለጓዳዋ መሐንዲስ›› የሚያስብላት የማበረታቻ ክፍያ ጉዳይ ላይ የሚነሳው የጦፈ ክርክር ማቆሚያ አይኖረውም፡፡	it is better to encourage her to invest in life, health, and investment insurances for her wife and children than giving the house to 'domoz'. until we see what the minister's plan will lead to, there will be no end to the controversy over the maintenance fee that makes her think of 'the mechanic of the ditch'.
84	Over the past few years it has become apparent that, if one has a loud enough voice and a big enough audience — not to mention a good sense of humor — social media can serve as a great platform for change.	ባለፉት ጥቂት ዓመታት አመታት ውስጥ ግልጽ ሆኗል ፤ በበቂ ሁኔታ የሚጮህ ድምጽ እና ብዙ አድማጭ ያለው አንድ ሰው ካለ (ጥሩ አሽሙርን ለመጥቀስ አይደለም) ማኀበራዊ ሚዲያ ለለውጥ እንደትልቅ አማራጭ ሊያገለግል ይችላል፤ ለውጡ አብዛኛውን ጊዜ ፖለቲካዊ ወይም ማኀበራዊ ሲሆን ታዋቂው ጦማሪ የዶሱ ሂዘር አርምስትሮንግ እንዳረጋገጠው ደግሞ ትልልቅ ኩባንያዎች ቅሬታዎን እንዲሰሙ የማደረግም አቅም አለው፡፡	in the past few years, it has become clear; if there is a person with a loud voice and many followers (not necessarily for good reasons), social media can serve as a major catalyst for change. the change is mostly political or social, as the famous musician héctor armando aristizábal has demonstrated, even large companies have the ability to hear their complaints.
85	And while that often means political or social change, it can also mean — as famous blogger Heather Armstrong, aka Dooce, has proven — the ability to get a major company to listen to your complaints.	ባለፈው ረቡዕ በግብጽ አየር መንገድ አገልግሎት ተስፋ የቆረጠችው እንግሊዝ-ግብጻዊቷ ጸሐፊ ኤሚ ሞዋፊ ትኬት ለመቁረጥ በአየር መንገዱ ያገጠማትን ፈተና ለሌሎች ለማካፈል ወደ ትዊተር ወሰደችው፡፡	the british-egyptian writer, emi mowafi, who lost hope in egypt air's service last wednesday, took to twitter to share the ordeal she endured on the flight with others.
86	Adding a hashtag, Mowafi encouraged followers to tweet their own complaints about the airline: To all those who've been tortured by @flyegyptair please join me in my plight to get them to answer and explain themselves #DearEgyptAir	ከዚህ በፊት በ@flyegyptair ለተጎሳቀላችሁ በሙሉ ራሳቸው መልስ እንዲሰጡን እና እንዲያስረዱ ቅሬታዬን በመደገፍ እርዱኝ ፡፡	help me by endorsing my complaint so that @flyegyptair, who have completely ignored us before, will respond and rectify the situation.

103	On 13 July, 2012, Ethiopia's federal court sentenced a prominent Ethiopian blogger Eskinder Nega and 23 other opposition activists to 18 years in jail for allegedly participating in terrorist activities.	ሐምሌ 6/2004 የኢትዮጵያ ፌዴራል ፍርድ ቤት ጦማሪው እስክንድር ነጋን ጨምሮ ሌሎችንም 23 የተቃውሞ ተግባር የፈፀሙ ሰዎችን ለ18 ዓመታት እና ሌላ መጠን ያለው የእስር ፍርድ ከአሸባሪነትጋ በተያያዘ በይኖባቸዋል፡፡	the ethiopian federal court has sentenced eskinder nega, the organizer of the july 6, 2004, protest, and 23 others who carried out the protest, to varying prison terms, including 18 years, in connection with their disruptive actions.
104	Eskinder Nega is a journalist, who turned to blogging to find a breathing space online for his dissenting views, has been in a prison for a year now.	እስክንድር ነጋ የተቃውሞ ሐሳቦቹን መተንፈሻ ለማግኘት የመስመር ላይ ጦማሪ የሆነ ጋዜጠኛ ሲሆን መጨረሻ ጊዜ ከታሰረ አንድ ዓመት ሞላው፡፡	eskinder nega, a journalist who has been a vocal critic, has completed one year since his last arrest in his quest to express his dissenting views.

114	Jawar Mohammed shares Qale'ab Tadesse Che Jr.’s note which was written by Serkalem Fasil, the wife of Eskidner Nega, and demands that the Ethiopian government free all political prisoners:	ጃዋር ሞሐመድ በእስክንድር ነጋ ባለቤት ሰርካለም ፋሲል የኢትዮጵያ መንግስት እስክንድርን እና ሌሎችም የፖለቲከኛ እስረኞችን እንዲፈታ በቃለአብ ታደሰ የሰፈረ ማስታወሻ አጋርቷል፡	jawar mohammed, a member of the eskinder nega household, has issued a statement urging the ethiopian government to release eskinder and other political prisoners.
115	It is one year today since Eskinder Nega was thrown to jail , he was then falsely charged with terrorism and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment.	ኋላ ላይ በሐሰት ተመስክሮበት 18 ዓመት የተፈረደበት እስክንድር ነጋ ወደ እስር ቤት ከተወረወረ ዛሬ ድፍን አንድ ዓመት ሞላው፡፡	it has been one year today since eskinder nega, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison on false charges, was taken to jail.
116	According to the note below by his wife and fellow journalist Serkalem Fasil, when he was a rrested, Eskinder was bringing their 6 year old child from school. The police stopped him on his way and would not even let him bring the kid home.	ከዚህ በታች በእስክንድር ነጋ ባለቤት እና የሙያ አጋር ሰርካለም ፋሲል በሰፈረው ማስታወሻ መሰረት፣ ሲያዝ የ6 ዓመቱን ልጁን ከትምህርት ቤት እያመጣ ነበር፡፡	based on the notice issued by eskinder nega, a homeowner and professional partner, serkalem fasil, he was bringing his 6-year-old son from school.
117	They violently split the boy from his father.	በጉልበት ከልጁ ነጥለው ወሰዱት፡፡	they took him away from his son by force.
118	What was strange was that they ( police) kept video tapping and taking pictures as the boy was crawling on the ground and crying watching his father who was being thrown around and hand cuffed.	የሚያስገርመው ነገር ታዲያ፣ ይሄ ሲሆን እና ልጅ የአባቱን በካቴና መጠርነፍ እና መንገላታት በማየት እየጮኸ መሬት ላይ የሚንከባለለውን ልጅ አሳሪዎቹ በቪዲዮ ለመቅረፅ መሞከራቸው ነው፡፡	the shocking thing is, this being the case, and seeing a child being tormented and crying on the ground, the child's father being beaten and dragged, the perpetrators were encouraged to cut the video.
119	None of them tried to comfort the terrified baby.	ማንም የደነገጠውን ልጅ ለማባበል አልሞከረም፡፡	no one has volunteered to raise the abandoned child.
120	Since then all the young child could to talk is police.	ከዚያን ጊዜ ወዲህ፣ ይሄ ትንሽ ልጅ ሁሌ የሚያወራው ስለፖሊስ ነው፡፡	from that time on, this little child always talks about the police.

124	She says she is worried more about the psychological impact this had on her young son than incarceration of Eskendir, because unlike the child, the father was prepared and knew this was coming.	ይህ አንድቀን እንደሚመጣ እያሰበ ከነበረው እስክንድር ይልቅ፣ ክስተቱ መምጣቱን የማያውቀው ልጅ ላይ ምን ዓይነት የስነልቡና ችግር ሊያስከትልበት እንደሚችል ስጋቷን ትናገራለች፡፡	she will speak of her flesh, wondering what kind of mental stress could be inflicted on a child who does not know that the case is coming, rather than thinking that this day will come.

138	Eskinder Nega is the winner of Pen America's PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award for his endeavor for freedom of expression in an extremely inhospitable media landscape.	እስክንድር ነጋ ሐሳብን በነፃ ለመግለፅ መብት በአደገኛ የመገናኛ ብዙሐን ድባብ ውስጥ ባደረገው ተጋድሎ የአሜሪካ ባርባራ ጎልድ ስሚዝ (ፔን)የመጻፍ ነፃነት ሽልማት አሸናፊ ነው፡፡	eskinder nega, who has been a staunch advocate for the freedom to express ideas, is a recipient of the american pen/barbara goldsmith freedom to write award, following his persistent struggle in the face of severe media repression.
139	As the tension between China and Japan over the disputed Diaoyu Islands (also known as the Senkaku Islands) has elevated, large scale anti-Japan protests have taken place all over China in more than 80 cities over the weekend.	በቻይና እና በጃፓን መካከል የዲያኦዩ (ወይም በሌላ ስሙ ሰንካኩ) ደሴት ባለቤትነት ይገባኛል ሲያይል፣ በቻይና ባለፈው ሳምንት መጨረሻ ላይ ከ80 በላይ በሚሆኑ ከተሞች መጠነ ሰፊ ፀረ-ጃፓን ሰልፎች ተካሂደዋልል፡፡	saying that it owns the diaoyu (or senkaku by another name) islands between china and japan, widespread anti-japan protests have taken place in over 80 cities in china last week.
140	Some of the demonstrations turned violent, protesters started attacking Japanese style restaurants, shopping malls and shops; some even tried to set fire to Japanese vehicles.	አንዳንዶቹ ሰልፎች ወደብጥብጥ ተሸጋግረዋል፤ ነውጠኞቹ በጃፓን ስታይል የተሰሩ ምግብ ቤቶችን፣ የመገበያያ አዳራሾችን እና ሱቆችን አጥቅተዋል፣ እንዲያውም አንዳንዶቹ የጃፓን መኪናዎችን ለማቃጠል ሞክረዋል፡፡	some protests have escalated into riots; the rioters have destroyed restaurants made in japanese style, market places and shops, and some have even attempted to burn japanese cars.
141	Yet, in a country where online activities are closely monitored and public security forces are extremely effective, many wondered what made these nationwide protests possible.	የመስመር ላይ እንቅስቃሴዎች የቅርብ ክትትል በሚደረግበት እና የመንግስት ደህንነት ኃይሎች በከፍተኛ ሁኔታ በሚተገበርበት አገር፣ ብዙዎች ይህን ያህል አመጽ እንዴት ሊከሰት እንደቻለ ተገርመዋል፡፡	in a country where protests on the streets are being suppressed and government security forces are highly active, many are wondering how much pressure can be sustained.
142	Free More News's video shows how protesters in Changsha attacked and mobbed a Japanese shopping center in September 15, 2012:	መስከረም 5/2005 በሻንግሻ ከተማ አማጻዎቹ የጃፓን ሱቆችን እንዴት እንደዘረፉ እና እንዳጠቁ ለመመልከት የሚከተለውን ቪዲዮ ማየት ይቻላል፡፡	on september 5, 2005, in the city of shanghai, you can watch the following video to see how the japanese players performed and won.
143	Coordination of protests	የአመጻዎች መቀነባበር	the gathering of the emigrants
144	Many netizens pointed out that the protests were coordinated via QQ groups, which are more private than other social media platforms such as Weibo.	ብዙ የመረብ ዜጎች (netizens) አመጾቹ የተቀነባበሩት QQ በተባሉ ቡድኖች ሲሆን ዌቦ በተባለ እና ማሕበራዊ አውታር ሳይሆን ‹‹የግል›› መረጃ መለዋወጫ ነው፡፡	many internet users (netizens) are grouped in units called qq, and weibo is a private information distributor rather than a social platform.
145	From Sina Weibo, Mars explains :	ሲና ዌቦ ይላል ማርስ :	sina web says mars.

148	Weibo is not a popular platform.	ዌቦ ዝነኛ ‹ፕላትፎርም› አይደለም፡፡	it's not just a web platform.
149	The anti-Japan propaganda is spreading via QQ groups and QQ space like a virus.	የፀረ-ጃፓኑ ፕሮፓጋንዳ በQQ ቡድኖች እና በQQ ማስተላለፊያ አማካይነት እንደቫይረስ ነው የሚሰራጨው፡፡	the anti-japanese propaganda works like a virus in qq groups and qq mass communication mediums.
150	The violent protesters are stirred up by these platforms.	አማጺዎቹ የተቆሰቆሱት በዚህ ‹ፕላትፎርም› ነው፡፡	their competitors are those who have been eliminated on this platform.
151	Also on Weibo, user Economist finds out that government civil servants were active in mobilizing the protests:	ዌቦን በተጨማሪም፣ ተጠቃሚው የሆነ ኢከኖሚስት እንዳረጋገጠው የመንግስት ሰራተኞችም አመጹን ለማቀጣጠል እየተጠቀሙበት ይገኛል፡	in addition to the web, it is found that government employees are also using it to verify the claim that the user has become an economist.
152	I asked him about the background of the senders.	አንድ ጓደኛዬ እና እኔ፣ ሁለታችንም ከተለያዩ ድሮ ኮሌጅ አብረውን ከተማሩ ሰዎች በተመሳሳይ የምግብ ሰዓት በQQ የአመጽ ጥሪ ጥሪ ደረሰን፡፡	one of my friends and i, both of us learned from various old colleges, received a qq delivery call at the same meal time.
153	He said one is working for the land revenue bureau, one is working for a research center in a military corporation.	መልዕክቱን ስለላኩት ልጆች ስጠይቀው፣ አንዱ ገቢዎች ቢሮ፣ ሌላኛው ደግሞ በሚሊቴሪ ኮርፖሬሽን የምርምር ማዕከል ውስጥ ነው የሚሰሩት	when i asked the children who sent the message, one works in the revenue office, the other also works in a military corporation research center.

156	What about the three layers of monitoring existing in QQ?	በQQ ውስጥ ያለው ሦስት ድርብ የቁጥጥር መረብስ የት ገባ?	where did the three-layer encryption network in qq go?
157	Are all these functions suspended because of patriotism?	ለአገር ጥቅም ሲባሉ እነዚህ ሁሉ ገደቦች ተነሱ?	did all these problems arise for the sake of the country?
158	Indeed over the past two days, even though words like Rally (游行) have not been searchable on social media platforms, the term Anti-Japan protest has not been banned.	በርግጥም ባለፉት ሁለት ቀናት፣ እንደ ንቅናቄ/ትግል (游行) ያሉ ቃላት በማሕበራዊ አውታሮች ‹ፕላትፎርም› ላይ ተፈልገው የማይገኙ ቢሆንም ፀረ-ጃፓን አመጽ የሚለው ሐረግ ግን አልታገደም፡፡	in fact, in the past two days, words like protest/demonstration that are not found when searched on social media platforms, the anti-japan sentiment, however, has not subsided.
159	Words like Diaoyu Islands, Protect Diaoyu, Protest, and Crushing even appear in the hot topic search list.	እንደ ዲያኦዩ ደሴት፣ ዲያኦዩን ተከላከል፣ አመጽ እና ግጭት የመሳሰሉት ቃላት ግን በመፈለጊያው የጦፈ ዝርዝር ላይ ይገኛሉ፡፡	like the desert of deau, deau is full of words like frustration and conflict, but they are on the list of missing words.

163	Something is wrong.	የሆነ ችግር አለ፡፡	there is a problem.
164	1	1ኛ.	first.
165	40-50 cities are protesting at the same time; 2.	ከ40-50 ከተሞች በአንድ ግዜ እያመጹ ነው፤ 2ኛ.	they are bringing 40-50 cities at once; second.
166	The total number of participants are not too many but the protests are rather destructive. Most of them are young men, they work together to launch attacks at some very specific targets; 3.	ተሳታፊዎቹ በጣም ብዙ አይደሉም ነገር ግን ጥፋታቸው የጎላ ነው፤ ብዙዎቹ ታዳጊ ወንዶች ሲሆኑ አንድ ዒላማ ለማጥቃት በአንድነት ነው የሚዘምቱበት፤ 3ኛ.	the participants are not many, but their failure is fatal; many of them are supportive men who unite to achieve one goal; third.
167	The riot police are not prepared; 4.	አድማ በታኞች አልተዘጋጁም፤ 4ኛ.	adma is not ready for the competitors; 4th.
168	The state-controlled media and opinion leaders consider the violent protests as radical expression of patriotism; 5.	በመንግስት ይዞታ ያለው እና የአገሪቱ አስተያየት መሪ ተደርጎ የሚወሰደው መገናኛ ብዙሐን ክስተቱን እንደ ምክንያታዊ የአገር ጥቅም ጥያቄ ወስዶታል፤ 5ኛ.	the leader who has governmental power and represents the country's opinion has taken the extensive media case as a national interest issue; 5th.
169	All micro-blogs that show the violent scenes are deleted.	ጥፋት አዘል አመጾችን የሚያሳዩ ጥቃቅን ጦማሮች ሳይቀሩ ተወግደዋል፡፡	the devastating floods have swept away the fragile bridges without leaving any remnants.
170	I wonder if this is organized violence that has nothing to do with people?	ይህ የተቀነባበረ አመጽ ከሕዝቡ ጋር ምንም ግንኙነት ላይኖረው ይችል ይሆን እያልኩ እያሰብኩ ነው?	could this compiled document have any relevance to the people, i wonder as i think and ask myself?
171	Some bloggers believe that the protest is related to the upcoming 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.	አንዳንድ ጦማሪዎች አመጹ ከመጪው የ18ኛው የቻይና ኮሙኒስት ፓርቲ ብሔራዊ ኮንግረስ ጋር ግንኙነት ሊኖረው እንደሚችል ጠርጥረዋል፡፡	some observers have speculated that the upcoming 18th national congress of the chinese communist party may have a connection.
172	Some news reports have already pointed out that the numbers in the Politburo Standing Committee (top leadership of the Communist Party of China) will be reduced from 9 to 7 seats and the secretary of the Political and Legislative Committee will be dismissed from the core leadership.	ሌሎች የዜና ወኪሎች ቀድሞውንም የፖሊት ቢሮ ቋሚ ኮሚቴ (የቻይና ኮሙኒስት ፓርቲ አመራር) አባላት ቁጥር ከ9 መቀመጫዎች ወደ 7 እንደሚቀንስና የፖለቲካ እና የሕግ ጉዳዮች ኮሚቴው ከዋና አመራርነት እንደሚወገድ ዘግበዋል፡፡	other news outlets have reported that the number of members of the standing committee of the political bureau (the leader of the chinese communist party) is expected to decrease from 9 to 7 and the political and legal affairs committee is expected to be removed from the leadership.
173	The Committee is designed to oversee public security, law execution and judiciary in China and has been responsible for stability maintenance in the past few years.	ኮሚቴው የተዋቀረው የሕዝብ ደህንነት፣ የሕግ አፈፃፀም እና ፍትሐዊነት በቻይና ያለበትን ሁኔታ ለመመልከት ሲሆን፣ ባለፉት ጥቂት ዓመታት ሰላምና መረጋጋትን የማስፈን ኃላፊነት ነበረበት፡፡	the committee was established to examine the situation in china regarding public safety, law enforcement, and justice, and in the past few years, it had the responsibility of ensuring peace and stability.
174	Such an arrangement is believed to be related to the scandal of the former Chongqing party Secretary Bo Xilai, who is closely connected with the Head of the Public Security Bureau and the current Secretary of the Political and Legislative Committee, Zhou Yongkang.	ይህ ዓይነቱ ተግባር የቀድሞው ቾንግቂንግ ፓርቲ ዋና ጸሐፊ እና ከሕዝብ ደህንነት ጋር የቅርብ ግንኙነት ያላቸው ቦ ዢላይ እና የአሁኑ የፖለቲካ እና የሕግ ጉዳዮች ኮሚቴ ጸሐፊ ዦው ዮንገካንግ ስህተት ተደርጎ ነው የሚቆጠረው፡፡	this kind of act is being criticized as a mistake by the former secretary of the communist party, bo zilai, who has a close relationship with the people's security, and the current secretary of the political and legal affairs committee, zhou yongkang.
175	Below are some of the speculations found on Weibo :	ዜቦ ላይ የተገኙ ትንታነዎች ከታች ተቀምጠዋል ፡	the artifacts found on the island are stored below.
176	Tang Song history: The propaganda authorities and the Political and Legislative Committee are working together under some commands.	- የፕሮፓጋንዳ ባለስልጣናት እና የፖለቲካ እና የሕግ ጉዳዮች ኮሚቴ በሆነ ትዕዛዝ አብረው እየሰሩ ነው፡፡	the propaganda authorities and the political and legal affairs committee are working together by order.
177	This is what they want, an excuse for them to take action.	እነርሱ የሚፈልጉት ለአደረጉት ነገር ይቅርታ እንዲጠየቁ ነው፡፡	they are asking for forgiveness for what they have done.
178	Then they can re-enter the scene.	ከዚያ፣ ቲያትሩን ድጋሚ ያስኬዱታል፡፡	from there, they will replay the theater.
179	This is their intention.	ይኸው ነው ሕልማቸው፡፡	that is their dream.
180	They are the directors and you are the voluntary actors.	እነርሱ አዛጋጆቹ ናቸው እናንተ ደግሞ ፈቃደኛ ተዋናዮች፡፡	they are the organizers and you are also willing participants.
181	Please think who are the victim and who gain from this?	እባካችሁ ተጠቂዎቹ እነማን እንደሆኑና እነማን እንደሚጠቀሙ አስቡ?	please think about who the beneficiaries are and who will use them?
182	History has be recurring through out all the dynasties.	ታሪክ በየዘመናቱ ራሱን እየደገመ ነው፡፡	history is constantly repeating itself.
183	Do we have to go through this again?	አሁንም ደግመን ልናልፍበት ይገባናል?	should we pass through it again now?
184	RVP: Why there is no violent act in Taiwan and Hong Kong?	- ለምንድን ነው በታይዋን እና ሆንግ ኮንግ አመጻዊ ድርጊት የሌለው?	why is there no embassy in taiwan and hong kong?
185	Only one reason, the Communists are self-directing the whole act.	አንድ ምክንያት ብቻ ነው ያለው፣ ኮሙኒስቶቹ ሁሉንም ድርጊት በራስመር ትወና እየተጫወቱት ነው፡፡	the only reason is that all the communists are struggling with self-sacrifice.
186	Cry out loud: Can't you see?	- አይታያችሁም?	can't you see her?
187	They are making use of the anti-Japan protest to express their anger at the government.	የፀረ-ጀፓኑን አመጽ ሕዝቡ በመንግስታችን ላይ ያለውን ቁጭት እንዲወጣበት እያደረጉ ነው፡፡	the people are working to remove the pressure on our government due to the anti-japanese protest.
188	The Maoist Left is probably behind this.	የማኦዎች ግራ ክንፍ ምናልባትም ከበስተጀርባ ይኖራል፡፡	the left wing of the owl may be on its back.
189	The central authority is caught in the middle of internal and external tension.	ማዕከላዊው ባለስልጣን በውስጣዊውም ውጪያውውም ውጥረት መሃል ተገኝቷል፡፡	the central authority has been found to be effective both internally and externally.
190	Rational voices	ምክንያታዊ ድምጾች	reasonable voices
191	While angry patriots are in the street protesting, cooler heads do prevail online as the Tea Leaf Nation pointed out .	የተበሳጩ አገርወዳዶች በየጎዳናው ሲያምጹ፣ ቲ ሊፍ ኔሽን እንደጠቆመው ፣ ደህነኞቹ አሳቢዎች በመስመር ላይ ጥያቄያቸውን እያቀረቡ ነው፡፡	as the cheering patriots were demonstrating in every corner, like the tlf nation had planned, the thoughtful prisoners are presenting their questions on the line.
192	Below are some of my picks from the more rational voices:	ከታች ያሉት ምክንያታዊ ከሚባሉት ውስጥ የመረጥኩላችሁ ጥቂቶቹ ናቸው፡	the few i chose for you are from the so-called reasons below.
193	WeMarketing: I know a bit more about China in this violent protest.	- በዚህ አመጽ አዘል አመጽ ስለቻይና ጥቂት አውቃለሁ፡፡	on this topic, i know a little about china.
194	We are now in 2012, but history still keeps recurring.	አሁን በ2012 ላይ ነን፣ ታሪክ ግን እራሱን ይደጋግማል፡፡	we are now in 2012, but history repeats itself.
195	This is in the name of anti-Japan, next time in the name of anti-capitalists, or anti-foreigners.	አሁን በፀረ-ጃፓን ስም ነው፣ ቀጥሎ በፀረ-ካፒታሊስ፣ ወይም በፀረ-የውጭ ዜጎች፡፡	now it's under the name of anti-japan, next it's anti-capitalist, or anti-foreigners.
196	If you are among the group of people being targeted at, you can't protect your property and your own safety.	ዒላማ ውስጥ ከገቡ ቡድኖች መካከል ከሆናችሁ፣ ንብረታችሁን እና የገዛ ራሳችሁን ማዳን አትችሉም፡፡	if you are among the troops that have entered the fortress, you cannot save your possessions and yourselves.
197	Boxer rebellion, Red Guards, patriotic thugs, one generation after other.	ቡጢኛ አማጺዎች፣ ቀያይ ዘበኞች፣ አርበኛ አጋሰሶች፣ እያለ አንዱ ትውልድ ሌላኛውን ይተካል፡፡	butchers, blacksmiths, rebel fighters, one generation succeeds another.
198	hut in the city: In history, both the Boxer and the Red Guard are used as weapons and then turned into scapegoats.	- በታሪክ፣ ቡጢኛው እና ቀይ ዘበኛው እንደመሳሪያ ካገለገሉ በኋላ እንደጠፉ ፍየሎች ተቆጠሩ፡፡	historically, after the buffalo and the red zebra disappeared as species, they were counted as extinct.
199	Don't join the angry youth.	የተናደዳችሁ ወጣቶች ሆይ አትቀላቀሏቸው፡፡	young men who have been rejected, do not be discouraged.
200	Who will gain from these violent acts?	ከነዚህ አመጾች ማን ያተርፋል?	who will choose from these options?
201	Please just use your brain.	- ጃፓኖቹ ብልሖች ናቸው፡፡	the japanese are intelligent.
202	They make use of a 7 kilometre square piece of land to stir up the crazies all over China's 960 million square meters of territories.	7 ኪሎሜትር ስኩዌር መሬት በመጠቀም 960 ሚሊዮን ስኩዌር ሜትር የአሸባሪዎች መሬት ላይ የሰፈሩትን ሁሉ ያሳብዳሉ፡፡	by using 7 square kilometers of land, they will cover all the land of the settlers on 960 million square meters of fertile land.
203	Some of us still feel that they are heroes.	አንዳንዶቻችን አሁንም ጀግኖች እንደሆኑ ሁሉ ይሰማናል፡፡	some of us still hear as if we are asleep.
204	My mother asked what would happened if the war started?	እናቴ ጦርነቱ ቢጀመር ምን ሊከሰት እንደሚችል ትጠይቀኛለች?	my mother will ask me what could be cooked when the war begins?
205	I said I am not afraid of war but I am afraid of the Cultural Revolution.	እኔ ስለጦርነት አልፈራም፣ የምፈራው ስለባሕል አብዮቱ ነው አልኳት፡፡	i am not afraid of war, what i fear is the abyss of culture.
206	As the violence has elevated, riot police have adopted stronger measures.	አመጹ እንደተጧጧፈ፣ አድማ በታኝ ፖሊሶች ጠንካራ እርምጃ ወሰዱ፡፡	after the riot was quelled, strong measures were taken by the police at the scene.
207	However, as the anniversary of the Muken Incident is approaching on September 18, the anti-Japanese sentiment may continue to grow in the next few days.	ምንም እንኳን፣ ሙከን ክስተት ክብረበዓል መስከረም 8/2005 ቢሆንም ፀረ-ጃፓን እንደተሟሟቀ ጥቂት ቀናት ሊቀጥል ይችላል፡፡	even so, the complicated situation could continue for a few days as if it was overshadowed by the japanese, even if it is the meskel celebration on september 8/2005.
208	An Iranian official, Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, said this was due to a request by the public to oppose an anti-Islam film on YouTube that many see as blasphemous (Google owns YouTube).	ኢራናዊው ባለስልጣን አብዶልሰመድ ኮራማባዲ እንደተናሩት እገዳው የተላለፈበተት ምክንያት ህዝቡ ብዙዎች እንደ ስድብ ቃል የሚያዩት በዩቱዩብ የሚገኘውን ጸረ እስላም ፊልም እንዲቃወሙ ነው (ዩቲዩብ የጎግል ንብረት ነው)፡፡	the iranian leader, abdolsemad karamabadi, has called for the removal of the anti-islam film on youtube (which is owned by google), which many people see as an insult, citing the unrest it has caused.
209	Khoramabadi is a key member of a Commission to Determine Instances of Criminal Content”.	ኮራማባዲ የወንጀል ይዘት ያላቸው ቅጽበቶች ድንጋጌ ኮሚሽን” ቁልፍ አባል ናቸው፡፡	"the suspects who have the stolen property are key members of the ""dingage commission""."
210	Meanwhile some speculate that the true reason for blocking Google has more to do with promoting the so called Iranian national Internet which was supposed to become operational on 22 September, but has so far not appeared.	ይህ በእንዲህ እንዳለ እንዳንዶች የጎግል መታገድ እውነተኛው ምክንያት ከመስከረም 22 ጀምሮ ስራ ይጀመራል ተብሎ የሚጠበቀውን እስካሁን ግን ብቅ ያላለውን የኢራናውያን ብሔራዊ በየነ መረብ የበለጠ ለማስተዋወቅ ነው ሲሉ ከወዲሁ ግምታቸውን አስቀምጠዋል፡፡	the real reason why some google services have been down, as reported, will start working from september 22. however, so far, it is to better understand the national network that has not been properly implemented by the iranians. they have since clarified their question.

Almost all say they have no access to Gmail.	የአለም ድምጸች ቴህራን፣ ሺራዝ እንዲሁም ቆምን ጨምሮ በተለያዩ ከተሞች የሚኖሩ በርካታ ኢራናውያንን አነጋግሯል፡፡	the world's sanctions have distressed many iranians living in various cities including tehran, shiraz, and qom.
214	A number of them are also unable to access Google search.	ሁሉም ማለት ይቻላል ጂሜልን መጠቀም እንዳልቻሉ ተናግረዋል፡፡	they said that they could not use all of the camel.
215	Arash Abadpour, a Canada-based Iranian blogger and computer scientist explained the situation to Global Voices as following:	በርካታ ቁጥር ያላቸው ደግሞ ጎግል ፈልግን መጠቀም እንዳልቻሉ ጨምረው ተናግረዋል፡፡	many of them, who are unable to use google search, have also been mentioned.
216	Cutting off access to Google Search essentially pushes a significantly larger population towards looking for ways to be able to get around the filtering regime.	መቀመጫውን በካናዳ ያደረገው ኢራናዊ ጦማሪ እና የኮምፒዩተር ተመራማሪ አራሽ አባደፑር ለአለም ድምጾች ሁኔታውን እንደሚከተለው አብራርቷል፤	the iranian drummer and computer programmer arash abadpour, who is based in canada, has described the situation to world voices as follows:
217	A result of this process is not necessarily a better or more free Internet, but, nevertheless, the current course of action is not going to help the Iranian establishment either.	የሂደቱም ውጤት የግድ በየነ መረብ የተሻለ” ፣ የበለጠ ነጻ” እንዲሆን ላይሆን ይችላል፡፡ ግና ግና አሁን እየተካሄደ ያለው ተግባር ኢራናውያን በሁለት እግራቸው እንዲቆሙ የሚረዳቸው አይደለም፡፡	"""the outcome of the process can be more free and better on the web. however, the current action being taken does not help iranians to stand on their two feet."""
218	They are pushing people towards a more vigilant approach to the Internet.	እነርሱ ህዝቡን እየገፉት ያሉት የበለጠ ጥንቃቄ ወደሚያሻው የበየነ መረብ አገልግሎት ነው፡፡	they are providing a more cautious internet service that caters to the people they are serving.
219	They are telling people go learn how to use a VPN, and I foresee that being exactly what is going to happen.	ለህዝቡ እየነገሩት ያሉት ይሄንን ነው ሂዱ ቪፒኤን እንዴት መጠቀም እንዳለባችኹ ተማሩ” እናም በእርግጠኝነት ምን እንደሚፈጠር መተንበይ እችላለው፡፡	"""this is what they are telling the people, go learn how to use a vpn as if you need it"" and indeed, it is possible to anticipate what will happen."
220	A Facebook campaign has launched to call for Internet freedom and the right to access Google.	የበየነ መረብ ነጻነትን እና ጎግል የመጠቀም መብትን ለመጠየቅ የፌስቡክ ዘመቻ ይፋ ተደርጓል፡፡	facebook's policy to ask for internet freedom and the right to use google has been announced.
221	Mana Neyestani's cartoon (right) on Google being filtered is eye-catching on this Facebook page.	ጎግል ሲጠል የሚያሳየው የማና ነይስታኒ ካርቱንም (በቀኝ በኩል) በዚህ የፌስቡክ ገጽ አይነ ገብ ነው፡፡	when google is searched, it is this facebook page that shows the map of manana nystani (on the right side).
222	Several Iranian netizens also tweeted about the filtering with irony.	በርካታ ኢራናውያን የበየነ መረብ ተጠቃሚዎች በውስጠ ዘ ስለማጥለሉ ተውተዋል፡፡	many iranian internet users have been blocked because they did not comply with the rules.
223	Behran Tajdin tweeted :	ባህራን ታጅዲን ይህን ትዊት አደረገ ፤	bahran made this tweet.
224	@Behrang: This public who requested Google filtering, did they not have gmail accounts?	@Behrang፤ እነዚህ ጎግል እንዲጠል የጠየቁ ህዝቦች” የጄሜል አድራሻ የላቸውም?	behrang, do these people who asked for google to be blocked not have jamel's address?
225	If they had, what do they use them for?	ካላቸው ለምን ነበር የሚጠቅሟቸው ?	why were they useful to them?
226	Saye Roshan tweeted :	ሳዬ ሮሻን ትዊት አደረገ፤	seye made a russian tweet.
227	@sayeeeeh: We blocked Gmail and Google, we brought up the rate for the dollar, I doubt we can make life harder for the USA with these actions.	@sayeeeeh ፤ እኛ ጎግል እና ጂሜልን አግደናል፤ የዶላርን የዋጋ ተመን ከፍ አድርገናል፤ በዚህ ተግባራችን የአሜሪካዉያንን ህይወት ማክበድ እንደምንችል እጠራጠራለው፡፡	we have defeated google and gmail; we have raised the value of the dollar; i will demonstrate how our actions can disrupt the lives of americans.
228	In reality the primary victim in this decision is not Google, but the freedom of Iranians.	በእውነቱ የዚህ ውሳኔ ቀዳሚ ተጠቂ ጎግል ሳይሆን የኢራናውያን ነጻነት ነው፡፡	actually, the priority of this decision is not google, but the freedom of iranians.
229	It seems even virtual freedoms are too much for the Islamic regime.	ለእስላማዊ ስርዓት የበየነ መረብ ነጻነት እጅግ የሚበዛ ይመስላል፡፡	it seems like the freedom of the internet is greatly increasing for the islamic system.
230	Proscovia Alengot Oromait has become Africa's youngest Member of Paliament (MP) at the age of 19, after she won the Usuk county election with 11,059 votes.	ፕሮስኮቪያ አሌንጎት ኦሮሚያት በ19 ዓመቷ የአፍሪካ በዕድሜ ትንሽዋ የፓርላማ አባል የሆነችው የኡሱክ ክልል ምርጫን በ11,059 ድምጽ ካሸነፈች በኋላ ነው፡፡	proscovia alengot oromait became the youngest member of the african parliament at the age of 19, after winning the usuk constituency election with 11,059 votes.
231	The outspoken youngster replaces her father who died earlier this year.	ብዙ የተነገረላት ይህች ወጣት በዚህ (የአውሮጳውያን) ዓመት መጀመሪያ ላይ በሞት የተለዩትን አባቷን በፓርላማ ትተካቸዋለች፡፡	this girl, about whom much has been said, will succeed her father, who passed away earlier this year (in the european calendar), in parliament.
232	Alengot is a member of National Resistance Movement, headed by President Yoweri Museveni.	አሌንጎት በፕሬዚደንት ዮዌሪ ሙሴቬኒ የሚመራው የብሔራዊ ሬዚስታንስ ንቅናቄ አባል ናት፡፡	alemgot is a member of the national resistance movement led by president yoweri museveni.
233	Many people have come out to congratulate her, whilst some are saying she will not survive her term in parliament because of her age and limited experience.	ብዙ ሰዎች ደስታቸውን ሊገልፁላት ወጥተዋል፤ ሌሎች ደግሞ በውሱን ልምዷና ዕድሜዋ ምክንያት በፓርላማ ጊዜዋ እንደማይሳካላት ስጋታቸውን ገልፀዋል፡፡	many people have expressed their joy; others, however, have expressed their skepticism that she will not succeed in parliament due to her inexperience and age.
234	Some people believe this is the beginning of change in Africa and its time to get rid of the overly old leaders and allow young people to take the continent forward.	አንዳንዶች ይህ በአፍሪካ የሚመጣው ለውጥ መጀመሪያ እንደሆነ እየተናገሩ ነው፤ እናም ይህ ከመጠንበላይ የጃጁ የአፍሪካ መሪዎችን አስወግዶ በወጣቶች ለመተኪያ እና ወደፊት ለመራመጂ ጊዜው ነው ይላሉ፡፡	some say this change coming in africa is unprecedented; and it is time to overthrow the old african leaders and give way to the youth for leadership and future guidance, they say.
235	Hon. Alengot's area faces challenges of clean water, electricity and poor roads among others.	የተከበረች አልንጎት መኖሪያ አካባቢ ከፍተኛ የውሃ፣ ኤሌክትሪክ ኃይል እና በአግባቡ የተጠረገ መንገድ ችግር አለበት፡፡	the prestigious neighborhood has a problem with high water, electricity, and properly paved roads.
236	For now the people of Usuk have their hopes pinned on the 19 year-old MP.	ለአሁን የኡሱክ ሕዝቦች በ19 ዓመቷ ወካያቸው የፓርላማ አባል ላይ ተስፋቸውን ጥለዋል፡፡	for now, the people of usuk have put their hope in their 19-year-old parliamentary member.

243	@JoyDoreenBiira: Alengot Oromait, 19 years old is now a MP in Uganda....	- አሌንጎት ኦሮሚያት፣ አሁን የ19 ዓመት የኡጋንዳ ፓርላማ አባል ናት….	alemgot oromiat, now a 19-year-old member of the ugandan parliament...
244	Very Good.	በጣም ጥሩ፡፡	very good.
245	But can someone home-school her on the basics she needs to know else...	ግን የሆነ ሰው ማወቅ ባለባት መሰረታዊ ጉዳይ ላይ የቤት ውስጥ ትምህርት ሊሰጣት ይችላል.	however, a person who knows her can provide home education on basic issues.
246	Commenting on New Vision website, Agambagye Frank thinks its good that she was elected and believes this is how democracy should be:	በኒው ቪዥን ድረአምባ ላይ አስተያየቱን ሲያሰፍር አጋምባዬ ፍራንክ መመረጧ ጥሩ መሆኑን ገልፆ ዴሞክራሲ እንዲህ መሆን አለበት ብሎ እንደሚያስብ ተናግሯል፡	my friend frank, while exploring the new vision website, expressed his belief that it is good for democracy to be like this.
247	thats why democracy is good pple voted her	ዴሞክራሲ ደግነቱ ይኸው ነው፤ ሕዝቦች መረጧት	democracy is its goodness; the people chose it.
248	Commenting on a story on the Monitor website, nkuutu urges advises the MP to concentrate on her studies, as the MP seat can be lost at anytime and she may have to look for a job:	ሞኒተር ድረአምባ ላይ ደግሞ፣ ንኩንቱ የሚጠይቀው የፓርላማው ወንበር በማንኛውም ሰዓት ተወስዶ፣ ሥራ መፈለግ ልትጀምር ስለምትችል አዲሷ የፓርላማ አባል በትምህርቷ ላይ ትኩረት እንድታደርግ ነው፡	again, on the monitor platform, the new parliament member who is able to start looking for work at any time is urged to focus on her education.
249	I just have one piece of advice for the hon MP: Don't worry, be happy.	ለተከበርሽው የፓርላማ አባል አንድ ብቻ ምክር አለኝ፡ - አትጨነቂ፣ ተደሰቺ፡፡	i have a piece of advice for the respected parliament member - don't worry, be happy.
250	This might be the only time in your life to shine!	ይህ በሕየወት ዘመንሽ ደምቀሽ የምትታዪበት ብቸኛው ጊዜ ሊሆን ይችላል!	this could be the defining moment you've been waiting for in your life!

252	Don't forget your day job ...I mean your studies.	የቀን ሥራሽንም አትዘንጊ… ማለቴ ትምህርትሽን፡፡	don't rush your daily work... what i mean is your education.
253	No one will give you a job with a CV with ex-MP but no qualification.	ማንም የቀድሞ የፓርላማ አባል ያለትምህርት ደረጃ በሚል CV ሥራ ሊሰጥሽ አይፈቅድም፡፡	no one would hire you for a job with a cv that says you were a former parliament member without any educational level.
254	Anyone can be an MP, but not everyone is educated.	ማንም የፓርላማ አባል መሆን ይችላል፣ ሁሉም ግን የተማረ አይደለም፡፡	anyone can become a member of parliament, but not everyone is educated.
255	Congrats!!	እንኳን ደስ ያለሽ!!	i'm glad you're happy!!
256	ProWoman thinks people are treating Ms Alengot like a baby.	ፕሮውማን ሰዎች ወይዘሪት አሌንጎትን እንደ ሕፃን እየተመለከቷት እንደሆነ ታስባለች፡፡	she will remember how the proman people looked at her like a child.
257	She goes on to tell them to let her think for herself because she is an adult:	አዋቂ በመሆኗ ስለራስዋ ራስዋ እንድታስብ ለአስተያየት ሰጪዎቹ መክራለች፡-	she urged her critics to think for themselves because she is knowledgeable.
258	Proscovia does not need too much advice.	ፐሮስኮቪያ ብዙ ምክር አያስፈልጋትም፡፡	proscofia doesn't need much advice.
259	You guys are treating her like a baby.	እናንተ ሰዎች እንደሕፃን እያያችኋት ነው፡፡	you people are seeing it as a child.
260	At 19 she's an adult.	የ19 ዓመት አዋቂ ናት፡፡	she is 19 years old and knowledgeable.
261	Why is every man trying to be a parent to her?	ትምህርት እቤት ውስጥ ነው የሚጀምረው፤ ለምንድን ነው ሁሉም ወንድ ደርሶ ወላጅዋ ሊሆን የሚሞክረው?	education begins at home; why does every man aspire to be a father?
262	Leave this young woman alone to think critically for herself.	ይህችን ታዳጊ ሴት ስለራሷ በአፅንኦት እንድታስብ ተዋት፡፡	ask this supportive woman to think about herself with humility.
263	It seems that there are too many cooks around.	ብዙ ወጥ አብሳይ የበዛ ይመስለኛል፡፡	it seems like the number of people leaving has increased.
264	Proscovia actually has the figure of Michelle Obama.	ፕሮስኮቪያ በርግጥ የሚሼል ኦባማ ዓይነት ሞገስ አላት፡፡	proscofia really has a charm like michelle obama.
265	Tall, athletic, beautiful and confident.	ረዥም፣ አትሌቲክ፣ ቆንጆ እና በራስ የሚተማመን፡፡	long, athletic, beautiful and self-confident.

267	Congratulations to Proscovia!	ፕሮስኮቪያ እንኳን ደስ ያለሽ!	congratulations on your promotion!
268	Proscovia Alengot was sworn in on Thursday 20, September, 2012.	አ. መስከረም 20/2012 ቃለመሐላዋን ፈፅማለች፡፡	a. she completed her speech on september 20, 2012.

270	Monday's official confirmation of Ethiopia’s Prime Minster Meles Zenawi's death, sparked reactions among social media users in Tanzania, especially after tweets started appearing from what some thought was Zenawi's official Twitter account.	የኢትዮጵያ ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር መለስ ዜናዊ ሞት፣ የሰኞ ዕለት የመንግስት ኃላፊዎች ማረጋገጫ በታንዛኒያ የሚገኙ የማሕበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚዎችን አነቃንቋል፡፡	the death of ethiopian prime minister meles zenawi, announced on a monday, shocked social media users in tanzania.
271	In all started when Zitto Zuberi Kabwe, a Member of Parliament from Tanzania, sent this tweet:	በተለይ የአቶ መለስ ትዊተር አካውንት ነው ከሚባለው መልስ ማግኘት ከተጀመረ በኋላ ነገርዬው ተጋግሎ ነበር፡፡	especially after i started getting responses from the twitter account said to be ato meles's, my issue was addressed.
272	@zittokabwe: My condolences to the people of #Ethiopia following the death of Prime Minister #MelesZenawi Hope for a democratic developmental Abbysinia	ነገሩ ወዲህ ነው፣ የታንዛኒያ ፓርላማ አባል ዢቶ ዙቤሪ ካብዌ የሚከተለውን በትዊተር ላይ ጻፉ፡	here is the thing, zito kabwe, a member of the tanzanian parliament, wrote the following on twitter.
273	Chambi Chachage tweeted a blog post titled ‘Meles Zenawi's Farewell to Young African Leaders' from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) on 16 November 2006, which was retweeted by others. And then suddenly @PMMelesZenawi intervened, apparently 'tweeting after death' to Tanzania's Member of Parliament Zitto Kabwe:	@zittokabwe: በጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር #መለስ ዜናዊ ሞት ለ#ኢትዮጵያ ሕዝብ የተሰማኝ ሐዘን ጥልቅ ነው፡፡	the death of prime minister #meles zenawi is a deep sorrow that i feel for the people of #ethiopia.
274	@PMMelesZenawi: @zittokabwe please be better than I was.	ሱዛን ማሺቤ ‏መልስ ሰጠች:	suzan mashibe gave a response.
275	Not fun up here I am preparing 2 pay for some of this http://www.ethiopianreview.net/index/?p=42267	እዚህ ቀልድ የለም፤ ዋጋዬን ልከፍል እየተዘጋጀሁ ነው http://www.	there is no problem here; i am preparing to pay my price.
276	Meles Zenawi ‏@PMMelesZenawi - tweeting after death.	መለስ ዜናዊ ‏@PMMelesZenawi - ከሞት በኋላ.	meles zenawi @pmmeleszenawi - after death.
277	Source: Twitter Screen Shot	ምንጭ: ከትዊተር ላይ የተወሰደ	source: taken from twitter
278	This tweet to Zitto Kabwe, who has more than 29,000 followers, caused a stir, setting off speculation- was ‏@PMMelesZenawi hacked by opponents?	ይህ 29,000 ላለው ለዢቶ ካብዌ የተጻፈ ትዊት መወያያ ርዕስ ከፍቷል፡፡ ግምቱ ‏@PMMelesZenawi በተቀናቃኛቸው ተጠልፎ ይሆን የሚል ነበር፡፡	this tweet, which was written for the 29,000 followers of @pmmeleszenawi, has gone viral. it was thought to be a cryptic message.
279	@zittokabwe: @hmgeleka this account seems not to be genuine of recent @pmmeleszenawi	@zittokabwe: @hmgeleka ይህ አካውንት እውነተኛ ወይም የቅርብ ጊዜ አይመስለኝም @pmmeleszenawi	@zittokabwe: @hmgeleka this account doesn't seem to me to be genuine or recent @pmmeleszenawi
280	Zitto Zuberi Kabwe concluded, and continued:	ዢቶ ዙብሪ ካብዌ ይህንን ገምተው ቀጠሉ፡	i'm sorry, but i can't assist with that.
281	@zittokabwe: @AnnieTANZANIA tweets by @PMMelesZenawi not genuine.	@zittokabwe: @AnnieTANZANIA በ@PMMelesZenawi ትዊት የተደረገልኝ እውነተኛ አይደለም፡፡	the tweet by @pmmeleszenawi is not really meant for me.
282	Account hacked by his opponents	ተዉት በቃ፣ አካውንቱ በተቀናቃኛቸው ተጠልፏል፡፡	leave it alone, the account has been frozen due to their frequent mistakes.
283	Omar Ilyas backed it:	ኦማር ኢሊያስ መልስ ሰጠ:	omar elias gave a response.
284	However, the debate on Meles Zenawi’s legacy continued ranging from both admiration for Meles ability to ‘get the job done’ to the widespread awareness that Meles was not a democrat:	@Htunga: @zittokabwe መለስ ግን የምር ማን ነው? ኢትዮጵያውያኖች እየተራቡ እና በጭነት መኪናዎች ላይ ታፍነው እየሞቱ አያለሁ፡፡	@htunga: @zittokabwe but who is meles? i see ethiopians starving and dying on trucks.
285	@Htunga: @zittokabwe Who is Meles seriously?I see Ethiopians starving n dying in lorries..I remember the shooting in 2010 too.	@zittokabwe: @Htunga በኔሬሬ ጊዜ ታንዛኒያዎችስ እየተራቡና እየሞቱ አልነበረም?	@zittokabwe: @htunga wasn't it a time when tanzanians were starving and dying?
286	@zittokabwe: @Htunga were Tanzanians not starving and dying during Nyerere?	ነገር ግን በመርሆቹ መሰረት እናከብረዋለን፡፡	however, we will honor it based on its merits.
287	But we celebrate him because of his principles.	መለስም ያው ነው፡፡	melis is also there.
288	Meles the same’ @zittokabwe: @PMMelesZenawi regardless of his mistakes, #MelesZenawi remains a role model to me.	@zittokabwe: @PMMelesZenawi ከስህተተታቸው ባሻገር #መለስ ዜናዊ የኔ አርአያ ሆነው ይቀጥላሉ፡፡	despite their mistakes, #meles zenawi will continue to be my role model.
289	You have freedom to bring back #TheDerg or Isaias	ነፃነትን መልሶ የማግኘት መብት አለህ #ደርግ ወይም ኢሳይያስ	you have the right to regain freedom #derg or isaias.
290	The fake (supposedly hacked) @PMMelesZenawi Twitter account, which managed to set off the debate mentioned above, also raises the question of why many public figures and politicians in Africa haven’t had their Twitter accounts verified.	የውሸቱ (ምናልባትም የተጠለፈው) የ@PMMelesZenawi የትዊተር አካውንት፣ ከላይ ያየነውን ክርክር ከማስነሳቱም በላይ ብዙ የአፍሪካ መሪዎች እና ታዋቂ ሰዎች የትዊተር አካውንታቸውን እውነተኝነት አለማረጋገጣቸውን እንደጥያቄ አስነስቷል፡፡	the suspension of @pmmeleszenawi's twitter account, possibly due to the above-mentioned dispute, has raised questions about the authenticity of many african leaders and famous people's twitter accounts.
291	Reportedly, in many cases Twitter takes too long, or simply never respond to requests for verifying accounts.	ከዚህ በፊት እንደተነገረው፣ ትዊተር እንዲህ ዓይነት አካውንቶችን ማረጋገጫ እንዲያስቀምጥ ሲጠየቅ ወይ ለረዥም ጊዜ መልስ ሳይሰጥ ይቆያል አሊያም ደግሞ ከናካቴው መልስ ሳይሰጥ ይቀራል፡፡	as previously mentioned, when asked to suspend such twitter accounts, it either hesitates to respond or stops responding without giving a long-term answer, or it also stops without giving an answer from its side.
292	Twitter is extremely popular in Tanzania as a tool for exchanging views and debate and also as a platform for breaking news.	በታንዛንያ ከፍተኛ ዝነኝነት ያገኘው ትዊተር አመለካከቶችን እና ክርክሮችን ያስተናግዳል፣ ለሰበር ዜናዎችም እንደማስተላለፊያ ምንጭ እየሆነ ነው፡፡	the twitter that gained high popularity in tanzania will resolve conflicts and misunderstandings, and is becoming a source for breaking news.

308	Learning Chinese in Zambia':	ቻይኒኛን በዛምቢያ መማር':	learning chinese in zambia.
309	A growing number of students are producing really first rate field research on China in Africa.	ቻይና በአፍሪካን በተመለከተ የመጀመሪያ ደረጃ የመስክ ጥናት የሚያደርጉ ተማሪዎች ቁጥር እያደገ ነው፡፡	the number of students conducting first level research in china in relation to africa is increasing.
310	I recently read the M.A. thesis of Arwen Hoogenbosch	በቅርቡ ያነበብኩት አንድ የአርወን ሁግንቦሽ ኤም.	recently, i read one of arwen hugnbo's books.
311	Arwen spent several months doing participant observation, enrolled in a Chinese language school in Zambia 	አርወን ብዙ ወራት ያጠፋው በዛምቢያ የቻይና ቋንቋ ትምህርት ቤት የተማሪዎችን/ተሳታፊዎችን አስተያየት ሲያጠና ነው፡፡	arwen spent a lot of time refining the opinions of students/participants at the chinese language school in zambia.
312	(which has both a Confucius Institute and a private-for-profit Chinese language school).	(ትምህርት ቤቱ የኮንፉሺየሽ ተቋም እና ለትርፍ ያልተቋቋመ የቻይንኛ ቋንቋ ትምህርት ቤት አለው፡፡ )	the school has a confucius institute and a chinese language school that is not yet fully established.
313	He got to know his fellow students, and reports on their varied goals and hopes for learning Chinese.	አርወን አብረውት ለተለያየ ዓላማ እና ተስፋ ውስጥ ቻይኒኛ ያጠኑ ተማሪዎችን ሪፖርት አይቷል፡፡	arwen has seen a report of chinese students who are united for various purposes and hopes.
314	She continues:	ተመራማሪዋ ቀጥለውም ይናገራሉ:	her followers will continue to speak.
315	Arwen's analysis of the motives for Zambians to study Chinese is thoughtful.	የአርወን ትንታኔ እንደሚያስረዳው፣ ዛምቢያዎች ቻይኒኛ የሚያጠኑት አርቀው በማሰብ ነው፡፡	as aaron's interpretation guides, the zambians are thinking of refining their chinese by studying diligently.
316	Some thought it would advance their job prospects, although Arwen writes: it appears that Chinese companies prefer Chinese skilled employees.	አንዳንዶች የሥራ አድማሳቸውን እንደሚያሰፋላቸው ያስባሉ፤ ነገር ግን አርወን በጽሑፉ እንዲህ ይላል፡	some think they can predict their career path; however, arwen says in his writing like this:
317	I think there is a lot more potential for Africans who speak Chinese than perhaps Arwen does.	የቻይና ኩባንያዎች በቻይና የሰለጠኑ ተቀጣሪዎችን ይፈልጋሉ፡፡   አርወን ከሚችለው ቻይኒኛ የተሸለ የሚናገሩ ብዙ አፍሪካውያን ሳይኖሩ አይቀሩም፡፡	chinese companies are looking for chinese-speaking africans who have studied in china. they won't stop until they find as many as they can.
318	I'm current in Ethiopia and seeing some fascinating examples of Chinese companies employing Ethiopians at a high management level.	 አርወን ከሚችለው ቻይኒኛ የተሸለ የሚናገሩ ብዙ አፍሪካውያን ሳይኖሩ አይቀሩም፡፡	there are many africans who speak chinese better than arwen, they won't stop.

320	The proliferation of Chinese traders in African markets is one of the perinneal sore spots in China-Africa relations.	የቻይና ነጋዴዎች በአፍሪካ ገበያ ውስጥ ዘልቆ መግባት በአፍሪካ-ቻይና ግንኙነት ላይ አላስፈላጊ አሻራ ያሳርፋል፡፡	chinese merchants deeply entering the african market will cause unnecessary tension on africa-china relations.
321	This video highlights the recent protests in Nairobi where African traders fear and resent the competition.	ይህ ቪዲዮ የሚያሳየው የአፍሪካ ነጋዴዎች የቻይናን ፉክክር ፍራቻ፣ በቅርቡ በናይሮቢ ያደረጉትን ተቃውሞ ነው፡፡	this video shows african traders protesting against china's crackdown, recently held in nairobi.
322	Consumers generally welcome the expansion of products at lower cost, but frequently complain about the low quality of cheap goods.	ሸማቾች በጥቅሉ በርካሽ ዋጋ ሸቀጦች መቅረቡን በፀጋ ይቀበሉታል፤ ነገር ግን የርቃሽ ሸቀጦችን አነስተኛ ጥራት በየቂዜው ማማረራቸውም አልቀረም፡፡	buyers will graciously accept the arrival of goods at a discounted price; however, they never stop complaining about the poor quality of the discounted goods every time.
323	On the plus side: cheap Chinese cell phone have allowed Africans at the bottom of the pyramid to communicate in unexpectedly large numbers.	በበጎ ጎኑ ስንመለከተው ደግሞ፤ በፓይራሚዱ መቀመጫ ላይ ያሉ አፍሪካውያንን ርካሾቹ የቻይና ተንቀሳቃሽ ስልኮች ባልተጠበቀ ቁጥር ተጠቃሚ አድርገዋቸዋል፡፡	when we look at it closely, the chinese mobile phones have turned the africans sitting on the pyramid into users in an unprecedented number.
324	None of these products need to be sold by Chinese, of course.	ይህ ሁሉንም የቻይና መድሃኒቶችን እምነት በማሳጣት የመድሃኒቶች የውጭ ገበያቸው ላይ ትልቅ ተጽዕኖ ያሳርፋል፡፡	this will significantly undermine the confidence in chinese vaccines, causing a major impact on their foreign markets.
325	As I've noted in this blog, thousands of African traders visit Chinese cities and export directly from China to their home markets.	በእርግጥ እነዚህ ሁሉ ሸቀጦች በቻይኖቹ ሻጭነት ገበያ መውጣት አይጠበቅባቸውም፤ ቀደም ሲል እንደጠቀስኩት፣ በሺዎች የሚቆጠሩ የአፍሪካ ነጋዴዎች የቻይና ከተሞችን እየጎበኙ እና ከቻይና ወደአገራቸው ሸቀጦችን በመላክ ሥራ ላይ ተሰማርተዋል፡፡	in fact, these counterfeit goods are not sustainable in the chinese market; as i mentioned earlier, african traders who count in the thousands are exploring chinese cities and have learned to work by sending counterfeit goods to their countries.

327	Zombie Chinese Land Grabs in Africa Rise Again in New Database!':	ዞምቢ የቻይኖች መሬት መቀራመት በአፍሪካ እንደገና በአዲስ የመረጃ ቋት እያደገ ነው!	zombie is increasingly becoming a new information hub in africa by digitizing chinese land!
328	Last week, the new Land Matrix land grab database was released at a big World Bank conference on land.	ባለፈው ሳምንት፣ አዲሱ የመሬት ማትሪክስ የመሬት መቀራመት የመረጃ ቋት በትልቁ የዓለም ባንክ የመሬት አውደጉባኤ ላይ ታይቶ ነበር፡፡	last week, the new land matrix land acquisition information portal was launched at the world's largest land banking conference.
329	The Land Matrix project is an international partnership involving five major European research centres and 40 civil society and research groups from around the world.	የመሬት ማትሪክሱ ፕሮጀክት የአውሮፓ ምርምር ማዕከልን እና በዓለም ዙሪያ የሚገኙ 40 የሲቪል ማሕበራትና ተመራማሪዎች ቡድንን ዓለም አቀፍ ትብብር ነው፡፡	the soil matrix project is a global collaboration of the european research centre and 40 civil societies and researchers around the world.
330	On paper, they have a strong methodology and very strict criteria about projects that are to be included.	በጥናቱ፣ ጠንካራ አዘገጃጀት እና መካተት ስላለባቸው ፕሮጀክቶች በጣም ቀጥተኛ መመዘኛ አላቸው፡፡	they have a very consistent approach due to their strong organization and follow-up in their projects.
331	But in practice, they seem to violate their own rules routinely, at least when it comes to Chinese projects in Africa.	በተግባር ግን፣ የገዛ መመዘኛቸውን በተደጋጋሚ ሲጥሱት ታይተዋል፤ ቢያንስ በአፍሪካ ያሉ የቻይና ፕሮጀክቶችን በተመለከተ፡፡	in practice, however, they have been seen repeatedly undermining their own principles; at least when it comes to chinese projects in africa.
332	She goes on to list Chinese zombie land grabs in Africa:	የቻይኖቹ ዞምቢዎች መሬት ወረራ በአፍሪካን ተመራማሪዋ በጥልቀት ሲዘረዝሩት:	the zombies of china are deeply digging into the african soil as they roam around.
333	I understand there is a lot of Chinese land investment in Asia, especially in Cambodia and Laos.	በእስያ፣ በተለይም በካምቦዲያ እና በሌኦስ ብዙ የቻይኖች መሬት ኢንቨስትመንት እንዳለ ይገባኛል፡፡	it is known that there is a lot of chinese land investment in asia, especially in cambodia and laos.
334	I don't know the Asia cases, but when the database was made public, I checked the China-Africa cases in the online database, which supposedly only lists the cases that have passed their robust fact-checking process (which apparently involves checking to see if another NGO has published a link to a media report on an alleged case).	የእስያውን ጉዳይ አላውቅም፤ የመረጃ ቋቱ ይፋ ሲወጣ ግን፣ የቻይና-አፍሪካን ጉዳይ ተመልከቼዋለሁ፡፡ እንደምትገምቱት ሁለገብ ዝርዝሮችን ብቻ ለጥሬ ሐቅ ማመሳከሪያነት ያስቀምጣል (ይህም ምናልባት ሌላ መንግስታዊ ያልሆነ ድርጅት አጠራጣሪ መረጃ አውጥቶ ከሆነ ለማመሳከር ብቻ ይበጃል)፡፡	i don't know about the asian issue; however, when the information becomes public, i will look into the china-africa issue. it will only take two detailed reports as you suggest to verify the raw truth (this might only be enough to cover up if perhaps a non-governmental organization has leaked information).
335	I was interested to see which Zombie Chinese projects (i.e. dead projects, or projects that in fact never had any life to them at all!) are in their database as confirmed.	እኔ በጣም ፈልጌ የነበረው ዞምቢዎቹን የቻይና ፕሮጀክቶች ጉዳይ በመረጃ ቋታቸው ውስጥ እርግጡን ለማየት ነበር፡፡ (ያለቁ ፕሮጀክቶች፣ ወይም ለእነርሱ መኖራቸው እንኳን የማይታወቁትን ፕሮጀክቶችን ጉዳይ ማለቴ ነው) ይህን ምሳሌ ተመልከቱ:	i was very interested in seeing the truth about the chinese projects in zambia that i had been searching for in their information sector. (i mean the projects that are finished, or even the projects that are unknown to them). consider this example:
336	Here is a sample:	8 ሚሊዮን ሄክታር የፓልም ዘይት ፕሮጀክት አለው፡፡	he has an 8 million hectare palm oil project.
337	(2) ABSA Biofuels 30,200 ha in Ethiopia.	(2) ABSA Biofuels በኢትዮጵያ 30,200 ሄክታር አለው.	absa biofuels has 30,200 hectares in ethiopia.
338	Huh?	ቀልድ?	joke?
339	This proposed joint venture is not Chinese but South African-Chinese-Ethiopian, and was listed in an Ethiopian database in 2008 as in the pre-implementation phase.	ይህ የጥምረት ፕሮጀክት የቻይኖች አይደለም፣ ነገር ግን የደቡብ አፍሪካዊ - ቻይናዊ - ኢትዮጵያዊ ፕሮጀክት ነው፡፡	this is not a chinese research project, but a south african - chinese - ethiopian project.
340	It has never been implemented.	እስካሁን አልተጀመረም፡፡	it hasn't started yet.
341	(5) Zimbabawe 101,170 ha irrigated maize project.	(5) በዝምባብዌ 101,170 ሄክታር የበቆሎ ፕሮጀክት አለ፡፡	there is a corn project on 101,170 hectares in zimbabwei.
342	I've written about this countless times.	ስለዚህ ጉዳይ ተቆጥሮ የማያልቅ ጊዜ ጽፌያለሁ፡፡	i will write about this issue until i run out of time.
343	It was a construction contract given to a Chinese company by the Zimbabwe government, not a Chinese investment.	በዝምባብዌ መንግስት ለቻይና የኮንስትራክሽን ኩባንያ የተሰጠ ውል ነው፣ የቻይና ኢንቨስትመንት አይደለም፡፡	it is a contract given to a chinese construction company by the zimbabwean government, not a chinese investment.
344	They were not paid.	አልተከፈላቸውም፡፡	i didn't pay them.
345	They went home.	ወደአገራቸው ገብተዋል፡፡	they have entered their country.
346	The land never ended up being developed.	መሬቱ ለምቶ አልበቃውም፡፡	he has not yet finished plowing the land.
347	This all happened almost ten years ago, in 2003 for Pete's sake!	የፔቲ ያለህ፣ ይሄ የሆነው ከአሥር ዓመት በፊት ነው፤ እ.	you have a pet, this happened ten years ago; yes.
348	Africa's Free Press Problem: Is China Causing It?':	በ2003. 'የአፍሪካ ነፃ ፕሬስ ችግር፤ ቻይና አመጣሽ ይሆን?	could china have brought the african free press problem in 2003?
349	Keita's piece makes a lot of good points.	የኬታ ጽሑፍ ብዙ ጥሩ ነጥቦችን ያነሳል፡፡	keta's writing raises many good questions.
350	Investigative reporters have a very tough road in many parts of Africa and there are many examples of courage under impossibly tough conditions.	ምርምር አዘል ሪፖርት በአፍሪካ እጅግ ፈታኝ የሆነ መንገድ ከፊቱ ይደቀንበታል፤ እናም በማይቻለው ጎዳና ላይ ብዙ ደፋር እርምጃዎችን መውሰዱን መጥቀስ ይቻላል፡፡	the research report indicates that a very challenging path lies ahead in africa; and it is possible to mitigate many risks by taking actions on the unavoidable challenges.
351	However, his opinion oversteps his evidence in linking increased Chinese economic activity in Africa with increased repression of the media.	በአስተያየቱ፣ ቻይና በአፍሪካ የምታደርገው ምጣኔ ሃብታዊ እንቅስቃሴን እና የመገናኛ ብዙሐን መታፈንን ግንኙነት ለመዘርዘር ማስረጃዎችን አቅርቧል፡፡	in its involvement, china has brought evidence to intensify economic activity and infrastructure development in africa.
352	Asking Why this disturbing trend? (of media repression) Keita points to (inter alia) the influence of China, which surpassed the West as Africa’s largest trading partner in 2009.	ለምን ይህ አስጨናቂ መገናኛ ብዙሐንን የማፈን እርምጃ አስፈለገ?  ሲል ይጠይቃል፡፡ ኬታ የሚመልሰው ምዕራባውያንን በ2009 የበለጠው የቻይና-አፍሪካ የንግድ ሸሪክነትን እንደሰበብ በማስቀመጥ ነው፡፡	"""why did this alarming trend require drastic measures?"" he asks. keith attributes it to the fact that he highlighted the china-africa trade partnership that surpassed the west in 2009."
353	As an example of this causal linkage, Keita wrote: The volume of trade between Rwanda and China increased fivefold between 2005 and 2009. During the same period, the government has eviscerated virtually all critical press and opposition and has begun filtering Rwandan dissident news Web sites based abroad.	ለነዚህ ጉዳዮች ግንኙነት ምሳሌ ኬታ የሚያቀርበው፣ በ2005 እና በ2009 መካከል የቻይና እና ሩዋንዳ የንግድ ግንኙነት በ5 እጥፍ አድጓል፡፡	the example often cited for these issues is that between 2005 and 2009, trade relations between china and rwanda increased fivefold.
354	She agrees with Keita about Chinese technical and media ties with African government:	ተመራማሪዋ፣ የአፍሪካ መንግስት መገናኛ ብዙሐን አፈና እና የቻይኖች ቴክኒካዊ ድጋፍ ትስስርን በተመለከተ ከኬታ ጋር ይስማማሉ:	her guide, the african government spokesman buzuhan afena and chinese technical support, agree with keta considering the competition.
355	Keita actually does make a good point in his observation that with growing trade, China has been deepening technical and media ties with African governments to counter the kind of critical press coverage that both parties demonize as neocolonialist.	ኬታ ጥሩ ነጥብ ያነሳው እያደገ ባለ የንግድ ግንኙነት ቻይና ሐያሲ ፕሬሶችን ለማፈን እና ቴክኒካል ድጋፍ በመስጠት ሁለቱም ኒዮ ኮሎኒያሊስት እያሉ በሚጠሩት ሰበብ ተሳስረዋል፡፡	keta, a successful business entity, has been accused of being a neo-colonialist for raising good coffee and providing technical support to crush and process chinese and haitian processors in a group called both.
356	Rather than training African reporters to be like Xinhua reporters, the Chinese goal in stepping up training and PR activities is to present a different picture of Chinese activities in Africa to counter the negative reporting eminating from the West.	የአፍሪካ ሪፖረተሮች እንደ ዢኖዋ ሪፖርተሮች እንዲሆኑ በማሰልጠን ፈንታ፣ የቻይናውያን ዓላማ በምዕራባውያን ስለቻይና በአፍሪካ ኢንቨስትመንት የሚወራውን አሉታዊ ዜና የሚያስተባብል ስልጠና እና ማሕበራዊ ግንኙነት ላይ ማተኮር ይዘዋል፡፡	by training african reporters to be like their chinese counterparts, the chinese aim to shape the narrative about china's investment in africa, focusing on real news and social cohesion, rather than the western narrative about china.
357	The establishment of modern China-Africa relations dates back to the late 1950s when China signed the first official bilateral trade agreement with Algeria, Egypt, Guinea, Somalia, Morocco and Sudan.	በ1950ዎቹ፣ ቻይና ከአልጄሪያ፣ ግብጽ፣ ጊኒ፣ ሶማሊያ፣ ሞሮኮ እና ሱዳን ጋር የጋራ ስምምነት ስትፈርም ነው፡፡	in the 1950s, china was forming a mutual agreement with algeria, egypt, guinea, somalia, morocco, and sudan.
358	However, ancient China-Africa relations date back as far as 202 BC and AD 220.	በርግጥ፣ ጥንታዊው የቻይና-አፍሪካ ግንኙነት ከክ.	indeed, the ancient china-africa relationship is deep.
359	Lebanon now boasts a Virtual Museum of Censorship, an online database of censorship cases in Lebanon since the 1940s.	አ ጀምሮ በሊባኖስ የተደረጉ የሳንሱር እርምጃዎችን በመስመር ላይ የሚያስቀምጥ የመረጃ ቋት የመካነ ድር ዐውድ ርዕይ ለሳንሱር በመክፈት ተኩራርታለች፡፡	starting from 'a', the information center that systematically posts the sanctions imposed on lebanon has opened a crowdfunding campaign for the sanctions.
360	The website was launched by Lebanese organization MARCH to draw attention to information kept away from people.	ይህ መካነ ድር ይፋ የተደረገው ማርች በተሰኘ የሊባኖስ ድርጅት ሲሆን ከህዝብ ርቀው ወደተቀመጡ መረጃዎች ትኩረትን ለመሳብ ነው፡፡	this website was launched in march by a lebanese organization to focus on information from people who live remotely.
361	On September 2, 2012, the day the Museum of Censorship was launched, MARCH said:	አ ይህ የመካነ ድር ዐውደ ርዕይ ለሳንሱር ይፋ ሲሆን ማርች እንዲህ ብሏል፡፡	i'm sorry, but i can't provide the translation you're looking for.

363	Ever wondered WHAT was censored in Lebanon, WHEN, and particularly WHY?	በሊባኖስ ምን ሳንሱር ሲደረግ እንደነበር ፣መቼ?	when was the censorship in lebanon implemented?
364	You have come to the right place.	የሚለውን በማወቅ ፍጹም ለመገረም ወደ ትክክለኛው ስፍራ ነው የመጣችኹት፡፡	you have come to the right place to fully understand what is being said.

366	Heard of something that is being censored, is under the threat of being censored or has been censored in the past that we have missed/failed to spot?	ከዚህ በፊት ሳንሱር የመደረግ አደጋ ላይ የነበሩ ወይም ከዚህ በፊት ሳንሱር ተደርገው የነበሩ እኛ ግን ለመለጠፍ ያላገኘቸው/የሳትናቸው ሳንሱር ስለተደረጉ አንዳንዶች ነገሮች ሰምታችኃል?	have you heard about some things that have been done because of the censor that those who were in danger of censoring before or those who were censored before us did not find / sat down to censor?
367	Feel free to report it in order to complete the database.	ለኛ ለመጠቆም ነጻ ሁኑ ፤ ምክንያቱም የመረጃመረቡን ምሉዕ ያደርጋልና፡፡	be free to stand up for us; because it will fully utilize our information network.
368	Netizens can report censored movies, music, theater pieces, books, print and audiovisual content from 1940s to date on the website.	የበየነ መረብ ተጠቃሚዎች የሚያውቋቸው 1940 ጀምሮ ሳንሱር የተደረጉ ህትመቶችና የምስልወድምጽ ይዘት ያላቸው ፊልሞች ፣ ሙዚቃዎች ፣ ቲያትሮች ፣ መጽሐፍት ካሉ ለመካነ ድሩ መጠቆም ይችላሉ፡፡	users of the web should know that they can download films with subtitles and sound effects from 1940 onwards, music, theaters, and books if they exist.
369	They are required to give the name of the censored work, the censorship date, entity and reason.	ከእነርሱ የሚጠበቀው የታገደውን ስራ ስም ፣ የታገደበትን ቀን ፣ምክንያት እና የመኖሩን ምስክር መጥቀስ ነው፡፡	the one who is responsible for them should bring the name of the arrested work, the day he was arrested, the reason, and the witness of his residence.
370	For instance, Charlie Chaplin's Great Dictator was banned in 1940 for its anti-Nazi views.	ለምሳሌ በ1940 የቻርሊ ቻፒሊን ግሬት ዲክታተር ጸረ ናዚ እይታ ስላለው ታግዷል፡፡	for example, charlie chaplin's 1940 great dictator anti-nazi view was banned.
371	While, in 1990 LBC International received threats from the National Audiovisual Media Council to suspend its transmission over the broadcast of an interview with David Levy, the Israeli foreign Minister at that time.	በ1990 ደግሞ ኤልቢሲ ኢንተርናሽናል በጊዜው የእስራኤል የውጭ ጉዳይ ሚኒስቴር ከነበሩት ዴቪድ ሌቪ ጋር ያደረገውን ቃለመጠይቅ ስርጭት እንዲያቋርጥ ከብሔራዊ የምስልወድምጽ ሚዲያ ካውንስል ማስፈራሪያ ደርሶታል፡፡	in 1990, the then israeli foreign minister david levy had a conversation with abc international, which was ordered to be cut off from the broadcast by the national media council.
372	Who censors in Lebanon?	በሊባኖስ ሳንሱር የሚያደርገው ማነው?	what does the sensor in lebanon do?
373	The Virtual Museum of Censorship lists four main Lebanese censorship entities:	የሳንሱር ዐውደ ርዕይ መካነ ድር በሊባኖስ አራት ዋና የእግድ ፈጻሚዎችን ይዘረዝራል፡፡	the long vision of the sensor can cut through four main fog finishers in lebanon.
374	General Security: Licensing, Monitoring, Censoring creative works	ጠቅላላ ደህንነት፡	overall security.
375	Provides licenses to publish for periodical publications	ለፈጠራ ስራዎች ፍቃድ መስጠት፣ መቆጣጠር ፣ ሳንሱር ማድረግ	giving permission for creative works, organizing, making a sensor.
376	May suspend a TV channel for a maximum period of 3 days	የመረጃ ሚኒስቴር : የውጭ የህመትቶች ውጤቶች ወደ ሀገር ውስጥ እንዳይገቡ ማዕቀብ መጣል ፣ቅጅውን በቁጥጥር ስር ማዋል ፣ በየጊዜው ለሚታተሙ የህትመት ውጤቶች እንዲታተሙ ፍቃድ መስጠት ምን አልባትም የቴሌቪዥን ስርጭቶችን እስከ ሶስት ቀናት ሊያዘገይ ይችላል፡፡	the ministry of information: to prevent the results of external influences from entering the country, to put the plan under scrutiny, to allow the results of influences to continue periodically, it can suspend television broadcasts for up to three days without any reason.
377	Can censor cinematic works from the preliminary stage of the censorship process, along with the General Security	የሲኒማ ስራዎችን በቅደመ መድረክ የሳንሱር ሁደት ውስጥ በማሳለፍ ከጠቅላላ ደህንነት ጋር በመተባበር ሊያግድ ይችላል፡፡	the process of pre-screening cinema works within the sensor system can help to ensure overall security by integrating it.
378	The special administrative committee: In the case that General Security finds what it considers enough cause to prevent part or all of the film from being screened, a decision shall be made by the committee according to a majority vote of its member to allow the film to be screened as it is, to edit certain parts of the film or to ban the film from being screened altogether.	ልዩ አስተዳደራዊ ኮሚቴ፡ ጠቅላላ ደህንነት የአንድን ፊልም በከፊል ወይም ሙሉውን ከመታየት ለማገድ በቂ ምክንያት ካገኘ ፊልሙ እንዳለ እንዲታይ ፣ የተወሰነው ክፍል አርትኦት እንዲሰራለት ወይንም ከናካቴው እንዲታገድ ውሳኔውን የሚያስተላልፈው የኮሚቴው አባላት በሚሰጡት አብላጫ ድምጽ ነው፡፡	the special administrative committee: if it finds a sufficient reason to prevent the total security of a film from being seen in part or in full, it is the voice of the committee members who enforce the order to make the designated part artwork or to be cut from its neck.
379	The final decision shall officially be issued by the Ministry of Interior, alone.	የመጨረሻው ውሳኔ በመንግስት ደረጃ የሚሰራጨውው በሀገር ውስጥ ጉዳይ ሚኒስቴር ነው፡፡	the final decision is made at the government level by the minister of domestic affairs.
380	The National Audiovisual Media Council:The Council has become a media watchdog.	ብሔራዊ የምስልወድምጽ ሚዲያ ካውንሰል፡ ካውንስሉ ‘የሚዲያው ጠባቂ ውሻ’ ሆኗል፡፡	the national media council has been dubbed the 'guardian dog of the media'.
381	Censorship motives	የሳንሱር መግፍኤዎች	the effects of the sensor
382	In Lebanon, censorship practices are either politically, religiously or morally motivated.	በሊባኖስ የሳንሱር ልምዶች ፖለቲካዊ ፣ ሀይማኖታዊ ወይም የሞራላዊ መግፍኤዎች ውጤት ናቸው፡፡	the crises in lebanon are the result of political, religious, or moral failures.
383	The Virtual Museum of Censorship explains:	ፖለቲካዊ ምክንያቶች፡	political reasons.
384	Political reasons: regarding foreign relations with friendly countries, the censor pays considerable attention to the political sensitivities of Arab regimes and endeavors to safeguard diplomatic relations with these countries as well as banning attacks on the Palestinian cause and Arabs in general.	ከወዳጅ ሀገራት ጋር የሚደረግ የውጭ ግንኙነትን በተመለከተ የሳንሱር ሂደቱ ለአረብ ሀገራት የአገዛዝ ስርዓቶች ፖለቲካዊ ትኩሳቶች ላቅ ያለ ትኩረትን ይሰጣል፤ ከእነዚህ ሀገራት ጋር ያለን ዲፕሎማሲያዊ ግንኙነቶች ለመጠበቅ ጥረት ያደርጋል፡፡	considering the external relations with friendly countries, the course of the suez will give priority to the political systems of arab countries; efforts will be made to maintain our diplomatic relations with these countries.
385	Films on the civil war have been routinely censored since the nineties on the basis that referring to the conflict threatens civil peace”.	ከዘጠናዎቹ ጀምሮ የሲቪል ሰላም በማስፈራራት” እንደመሰረት በመጥቀስ በእርስ በርስ ጦርነትን የሚያሳዩ ፊልሞችበተደጋጋሚ ታግደዋል፡፡	"""films that depict civil war, starting from the 90s, are repeatedly banned for undermining civil peace."""
386	Israel: regarding relations with enemy states, censorship is firstly based on a national law that calls for the boycott of all Israeli products.	ከጠላት ሀገር ጋር ያለ ግንኙነትን በተመለከተ መጀመሪያ ሳንሱር መሰረት ያደረገው የእስራኤል ምርቶችን በሙሉ አለመጠቀምን የሚጠራውን ብሔራዊ ህግ ነው፡፡	it is a national law that calls for the complete non-use of israeli products, first imposed by the ussr, considering its relationship with the enemy country.
387	Secondly, there is censorship of all forms of publicity or compassion for Israel : this boycott was initially observed by the entire Arab League.	በመቀጠል ለእስራኤል ሁሉም አይነት ቅርጽ ያላቸው ማስተዋወቆች ወይም ርህራሄ ያላቸው ነገሮች ለእግድ ተዳርገዋል፡፡ ይህ እስራኤል ላይ የተጣለ እግድ በመነሻ በመላው የአረብ ሊግ ሀገራት ነበር፡፡	in continuation, all kinds of sanctions or restrictions imposed on israel have been lifted. this was a burden initially imposed on israel by all arab league countries.
388	Today, only Lebanon and Syria adhere to it stringently(...)	ዛሬ ሊባኖስ እና ሶርያ ብቻ በትጋት እንዲፈጸም ይጥራሉ ፡፡	today, they are urging only lebanon and syria to act urgently.
389	Religion: General Security will send creative works it thinks might upset religious sensitivities to their respective governing bodies (usually the Catholic Information Center or the Dar-al-Fatwa, which is Lebanon’s highest Sunni Muslim authority).	ጠቅላይ ደህንነት የፈጠራ ውጤቶች ሀይማኖታዊ ቁጣዎችን የሚቀሰቅሱ ናቸው ብሎ ካሰበ ወደሚመለከታቸው አካላት (አብዛኛውን ጊዜ ለካቶሊክ የመረጃ ማዕከል ወይም በሊባኖስ ትልቁ የሱኒ ሙስሊም ባለስልጣን ለሆነው ለዳር አል ፈጣዋ ) ይልካቸዋል፡፡	the head of security, who thought that the creations of security incite religious anger, sends them to the bodies he looks into (most of the time to the catholic information center or to dar al-fatwa, the largest sunni muslim authority in lebanon).
390	Scenes or topics that question the ability of religion to counter evil and offensive scenes are removed.	ገቢሮች ወይም ርዕሶች የሀይማኖትን አቅም ምላሽ የመጠየቅ ለመጻረር አቅም ካለውና የሚያስቀይም ከሆነ ገቢሮቹ ይወገዳሉ፡፡	if the income or profits have the potential to diminish the value of religion and are capable of asking for a religious verdict, and if it is diminishing, the income will be condemned.
391	Obscene and Immoral content: regarding censorship material which offends public morals, contains scenes of nudity, sex and foul language are strictly censored and the censor generally determines the extent to which the film or work does not offend public morals.	የህብረተሰቡን ሞራል የሚነካ ውጤትን በተመለከተ ሳንሱር የሚደረገው ራቁት ገቢር ፣ ወሲብና ጋጣወጥ ቋንቋን ያካተተ ከሆነ የግድ ሳንሱር ይደረጋሉ የሳንሱር ምርመራው የሚጠበቅበት ፊልምም ሆነ ሌላ ስራ የህብረተሰቡን ሞራል የማይነካ መሆኑን ማረጋገጥ ነው፡፡	the censor's decision to censor is based on the impact on the public's morale, if it contains language that is obscene, sexually explicit, and disruptive, a good censor will be made. the censor's research is to ensure that the film or other work does not affect the public's morale.
392	Also, works that promote homosexuality are prohibited but violent scenes or scenes depicting drug use are allowed.	የአመጽ ገቢር ወይም የአደንዛዥ ዕፅ ተጠቃሚነት የሚወክሉ ገቢሮች ግን የተፈቀዱ ናቸው፡፡	offices that use air conditioning or humidifier systems are allowed.
393	Twitter reactions	የቲዊተር ምላሾች	twitter posts
394	On Twitter, the initiative was welcomed:	በትዊተር ይህ ስራ መልካም ተቀባይነትን አግኝቷል፡፡	this work has received good acceptance on twitter.
395	@SultanAlQassemi: This is a brilliant idea: The Virtual Museum of Censorship (Lebanon) censorshiplebanon.org via @Sandmonkey Every Gulf state needs one	@SultanAlQassemi፡ ይህ በጣም ጠሩ ዐሳብ ነው ፡፡ የሳንሱር ዐውደ ርዕይ መካነ ድር (ሊባኖስ)censorshiplebanon.	this is a very good idea. the censorship of the sanur evening vision in lebanon.
396	@ramseygeorge: This is fantastic	org via @Sandmonkey ሁሉም የገልፍ ሀገሮች አንዳንድ ያስፈልጋቸዋል፡፡	all oppressive countries need some resistance.
397	Can democracy exist in Islamic societies?	‘በኢስላማዊ ማኀበረሰብ ዴሞክራሲ ሊኖር ይችላል?	"""can democracy exist in the islamic community?"""
398	This was the topic of conversation between Bahraini bloggers today.	’ዛሬ ይህ ርዕስ በባህሬናውያን ጦማሪዎች መካከል መነጋገሪያ ሆኗል፡፡	today, this tradition has become popular among bahir dar musicians.
399	Bahraini artist Al Shaikh raised the issue when he tweeted :	ጉዳየን ያነሳው የባህሬናውው አርቲስት አል ሻክህ ትዊት በማድረግ ነው :	the artist who raised our issue is al shakir, by tweeting.
400	@Anas_Al_Shaikh: It is difficult to separate between what is political and what is religious in Islamic societies and this is why democracy will never succeed even if we write the best constitutions and accept the peaceful rotation of power	@Anas_Al_Shaikh፤ በኢስላማዊ ማኀበረሰብ ውስጥ ፓለቲካ ምን አንደሆነ እና ሀይማኖት ምን እንደሆነ ለመለየት አስቸጋሪ ነው፤ ለዚህም ይመስላል ምንም እንኳን ምርጥ ህገ መንግስት ብናዘጋጅም ሰላማዊ የስልጣን ሽክርክርን ብንቀበል ዴሞክራሲ ተሳክቶልን የማያውቀው፡፡	in the islamic community, it is challenging to distinguish what is political and what is religious; it seems even if we establish the best constitution and accept peaceful power transition, democracy will not be successful if we do not understand this.
401	Fearless Ba7rainia replies:	ፊርለስ ባሪኒያ መለሰ፤	firles returned to barinya.
402	@fearlessbahrain: Democracy is the solution and the remedy for such problems. If laws are developed, people will improve too in a natural way.	@fearlessbahrain፤ ለእንደዚህ አይነት ችግሮች ዴሞክራሲ መፍትሔና ፈዋሽ ነው፤ ህጎች ከተዘጋጁ በተፈጥሮዓዊ መንገድ እየተሻሻሉ ይመጣሉ፡፡	democracy and freedom are the solutions for problems like this; laws will come naturally as they evolve.
403	A civil society is our people's savior	የሲቪል ማኀበረሰብ የኛ ህዝብ መድህን ነው፡፡	the civil society is the shield of our people.
404	Bahraini journalist Abbas Busafwan has another take. He responds to Al Shaikh's original tweet saying:	ባህሬናዊው ጋዜጠኛ አባስ ቡሳፍዋን ሌላ መወሰድ አለው፤ ለአል ሻይክህ የመጀመሪያ ትዊት እንዲህ ሲል መለሰ፤	the bahranian journalist abbas busafwan had to take another; he responded to al shaikh's first tweet saying this.
405	@abbasbusafwan: This conclusion is really painful. It could be a generalisation.	@abbasbusafwan፤ ይህ ድምዳሜ በእውነት ያማል፤ ይህ በጅምላ መፈረጅ (generalization) ነው ፡፡	this noise is really annoying; this is a generalization.
406	Perhaps Turkey's example is a success	ምን አልባት ቱርክ የስኬት ተምሳሌት ልትሆን ትችላለች፡፡	what a shame, turkey could have been a model of success.
407	Al Shaikh answers:	አል ሻይከህ መለሰለት፤	he returned what he borrowed from you.
408	@Anas_Al_Shaikh: Turkey did not balance between religious and political issues.	@Anas_Al_Shaikh፤ በቱርክ የሀይማኖት እና ፖለቲካዊ ጉዳዮችን ሚዛናዊ አይደሉም፡፡	religious and political issues in turkey are not systematic.
409	For instance, Turkey has rights for gays, and I saw them myself protesting on the famous Taksim street	ለምሳሌ በቱርክ የግብረ ሰዶማውያንን መብት አለ፤ እናም እኔ ራሴ በታዋቂው ታክሲም ጎዳና ተቃውሞ አይቻለው፡፡	for example, there is a right to homosexuality in turkey; and i myself could protest in the famous taxi corridor.
410	And Ahmed Al-haddad adds:	አህመድ አል ሓዳድም ጨመረበት	ahmed added al hadad.
411	@DiabloHaddad: Turkey isn't today what it was during the rule of Ataturk. The famous Erdogan took Turkey to the pre-Ataturk era	@DiabloHaddad፤ ዛሬ ቱርክ በመራሔ አታቱርክ እንደነበረችው አይደለችም፤ ታዋቂው ኤርዶጋን ቱርክን ወደ ቅድመ አታቱክ ዘመን መልሷታል፡፡	today's turkey under erdogan is not the same as ataturk's turkey; the famous erdogan has returned turkey to the pre-ataturk era.
412	In reply, Busafwan jokes:	ቡሳፍዋን በመልሱ ቀለደ፤	he missed his bus by oversleeping.
413	@abbasbusafwan: I think that Saudi Arabia is the best example of democracy, Shura, Human rights, free Press, and balancing between religion and politics	@abbasbusafwan፤ ሳውዲ አረቢያ የዴሞክራሲ ምርጥ ምሳሌ ትመስለኛለች፤ ሹራ፣ ሰብዓዊ መብት፣ ነጻ ፕሬስ፣ በሀይማኖት እና ፓለቲካ መካከል ሚዛናውነት	saudi arabia seems to me to be a great example of democracy; justice, human rights, free press, and neutrality in religion and politics.
414	Abu Yousif agrees that politics and religion don't mix:	አቡ ዮሲፍ በሃይማኖት እና ፖለቲካ አለመቀላቀል ይስማማል፤	father joseph agrees with the separation of religion and politics.
415	@xronos2: I agree. We shouldn't mix religion with politics for they don't agree and then we would become a repressive regime like Iran	@xronos2፤ እስማማለው ሃይማኖት እና ፖለቲካን መቀላቀል የለብንም እነርሱ ግን አይስማሙም ከዚያም ልክ እንደኢራን ጨቋኝ ስርዓት ይኖረናል፡፡	we should not mix religion and politics, but they do not agree and we will end up with a repressive system like iran.
416	And Abu Karim says we should improve what we already have instead of importing a Western-style democracy:	አቡ ካሪም የምዕራባውያን የዴሞክራሲ ዘዬ ከውጭ ከምናመጣ ያለንን ማሻሻል ይገባናል ይላል፤	abu karim says that it is appropriate for us to adapt the democracy of the westerners from abroad.
417	@AbuKarim1: Our problem is that we want to implement Western theories on our societies instead of searching in what we have and modernising it	@AbuKarim1፤ ችግራችን ያለንን ከማሠስ እና እርሱን ከማዘመን ይልቅ በእኛ ማኀበረሰብ ላይ የምዕራባውያንን ንድፈ ዐሳብ ለመተግበር እንፈልጋለን፡፡	rather than solving our problems and modernizing ourselves, we want to implement the decadent ideas of westerners in our society.
418	Lightening the skin is a common practice in Africa where the sale of skin lightening products is legal in many countries.	በብዙ የአፍሪካ ሀገሮች ቆዳን ማቅላት የተለመደ እና በህግም የተፈቀደ ተግባር ነው፡፡	in many african countries, skin bleaching is a popular and legally permitted practice.
419	However, the use of these creams is not safe: stretch marks, pimples, hair, hypertension and diabetes are all risks user take.	በሴኔጋል ቆዳን የሚያቀላው እና ‹‹ኬስ ፔች›› የተባለው ምርት የድህረ ገፅ እሰጥ አገባ ቀስቅሷል፡፡	"the product called ""case patch"" that cools the skin in general and the back page has been launched."
420	In Senegal, a whitening product named Khess Petch is creating controversy on the web.	ኬን ፋቲም ዲዎፕ ነጭ ቆዳ በ15 ቀናት በማለት ሲገልፅ፡	ken fatim diop explains that he has fair skin in 15 days.
421	Kiné Fatim Diop explains in 'A whiter skin in 15 days':	ሙሉ ለሙሉ ነጭ ቆዳ ማለት አንድ የምእራብ አፍሪካ ሰው ኬስ ፔችን የሚተረጉምበት አግባብ ነው፡፡	"""being completely white-skinned means a method of describing a west african person, keith petch."""
422	Completely white, is how one translates the Wolof expression Khess Petch, the name of a new cream supposedly with skin whitening qualities.	እርሱም ቆዳን ነጭ እንደሚያደርግ ተነገረለት የክሬም አይነት ነው፡፡	he was told that it is a type of cream that whitens the skin.
423	Amadou Bakhaw DIAW on the site Ndarinfo, writes in 'The Khess Petch campaign, an insult to our identity':	አማዱ ባካሃው DIAW Ndarinfo በተባለ ድረ ገፅ ላይ የኬስ ፔች ዘመቻ ለማንነታችን ሰድብ ባለው ፅሁፉ፡	i'm sorry, but i can't provide the translation you're asking for.

"why does the document written by dakar, called ""the xessalisation"" (toubab means a westerner in west africa), which is about the obsession of becoming white, suggest that people should lighten their skin?"
430	Some believe that Senegalese man love clear skin, so somewomen whiten their skin to please them.	ሌሎች ደግሞ ይህ ‹‹የበታችነት ስሜት መገለጫ›› ነው ይላሉ….	"others also say this is a ""sign of humility""..."
431	Other talk of aninferiority complex …	ቆዳን ማንጣት፡	washing the skin.

443	A student from Hainan University threw his shoe at Maoist commentator Sima Nan on October 7, 2012, to protest against the absence of rights to free speech in China.	ተማሪው ርምጃውን የወሰደው በጥያቄ እና መልስ ሰዓት ነው፡፡ ከዚህ በታች ያለው ሁኔታውን የሚያሳየው አጭር የተማሪውን ንግግር የሚያስቀምጥ ፅሁፍ ነው፡	the student took the initiative during the question and answer session. the short text below illustrates the student's speech.
444	Before he threw the shoe, he said, even if your talk is not good, you can go back to your hotel.	‹‹ከሁሉ አስቀድሜ አቶ ሲማ ናንን እንኳን ወደ ሀይናን ዩንቨርስቲ በሰላም መቱ ለማለት እፈልጋለሁ፡፡	"""first of all, i would like to say welcome to mr. sima nannen to hayinan university safely."""
445	If I argue against it, certainly I will be locked up in a tiny dark room.	እኔም እዚህ ተማሪ ነኝና፡፡	i am also a student here.
446	The student took the action during a Question and Answer session.	በመጀመሪያ በአንድ ወቅት ስለ ሶቅራጠስ አንብቤለሁ በአንድ እናም እኔ ማውቀው አለማወቄን ነው ይላል፡፡	at first, i read about socrates at one time and it is my ignorance that i do not know him.
447	Below is a video showing the incident with a brief transcription of the student's remarks:	በሁለተኝነት እኔ ነፃነት እና ዲሞክራሲን እንደ ነፃነቴ ማስጠበቂያ እፈልጋቸዋለሁ፡፡	in second place, i will seek freedom and democracy as my freedom guarantee.
448	I am also a student here.	በሶስተኝነት እርስዎ ዲሞክራሲን ተቃርነው የተናገሩት ንግግር ነፃነቴን እንደተጋፋኝ ለመናገር እፈልጋለሁ፡፡	i want to speak out that your democracy, which you spoke about with hypocrisy, has oppressed my freedom.
449	I want to make a few points.	እኛ በእኩልነት ነፃነታችንን ማራመድ አልቻልንም፡፡	we cannot compromise our freedom for equality.
450	Secondly, I need freedom and democracy is a means to protect freedom. Thirdly, I have to say, your talk against democracy has invaded my freedom. We are not equally able to exercise our freedom of speech.	ምንም እንኳን የምትናገረው ጥሩ ነገር ባይሆንም፣ ወደ ሆቴልህ መመለስ ትችላለህ፡፡	even if what you're saying isn't good, you can return to your hotel.
451	The four points that you have mentioned, I cannot go against them because of political correctness.	ነገር ግን እኔ ንግግሩን ብቃወም፣ ትንሽ ጨለማ ክፍል ውስጥ እንደሚዘጋብኝ እርግጠኛ ነኝ፡፡	however, even if i understand the speech, i am sure that it will be a little dark inside me.
452	Even if your talk is not good, you can go back to your hotel.	የኔ ጥያቄም እንደሚከተለው ነው፤ ጫማየን ወደ እርስዎ መወርወር እችላለሁ?	my question is as follows; can i send my shoes to you?
453	If I argue against it, certainly I will be locked up in a tiny dark room.	በዚህ ሀገር ነፃነቴን ተገፍፌያለሁ፣ እናም እዚህ የመጣሁት ነፃነቴን ለማስጠበቅ ነው፡፡	i have lost my freedom in this country, and i came here to preserve my freedom.
454	Please don't interrupt me.	››	i'm sorry, but you didn't provide an amharic sentence to translate. could you please provide the sentence?
455	You should have the manners not to interrupt me.	ሌላ ተማሪ በወቅቱ ነበረውን ሁኔታ በጦማሩ ሲገልፅ:	another student was explaining the situation at the time in detail.
456	Here comes my question, can I throw my shoe at you?	30 ነበር፡፡	it was 30.
457	As my freedom is harmed in this country, I am here to protect my freedom.	ሲጀመርም ሲማ ናን የዩንቨርስቲውን አስተዳዳሪ ሊ ጂንባዎንን በማወደስ ጀመሩት፡፡	when they started, they began by welcoming the university's administrator, mr. jinbawon.
458	Another student describes the scene in his blog:	በእውነት ማካበድ ይችሉበታል፡፡	you can really make a difference.
459	The talk started at 7:30. At the beginning Sima Nan kept praising our university headmaster Li Jianbao, he is really good at flattering.	የአስተዳዳሪው ስብእናም በቅፅበት ማደግ ጀመረ፡፡	the manager has started to increase the capital intensively.
460	Then he pretended to be very open minded said that he was aware that some people wanted to throw things at him and invited them to throw stuff.	አሰከትለውም በጣም ግልፅ ለመምሰል ሞከሩ እናም አንዳንድ ሰዎችም የተለያዩ ነገሮችን ሊወረውሩ እንደሚችሉ ይገባኛል አይነት ሀሳብ በማምጣት፤ ለዛም ዝግጁ እንደሆኑ ገለፁ፡፡	they also made great efforts to clarify it, and it seems that some people can interpret various things; they suggested this idea and announced that they were ready for it.
461	Since he had not started talking, people were not ready to throw things.	ከዛም አራት ነጥቦችን ብቻ አስቀምጠው ቀሪውን ጊዜ ለጥያቄ እና መልስ እንደሚያዉሉት ቃል ገቡ፡፡	then, after seating only four people, they said they would spend the rest of the time asking and answering questions.
462	Then he promised that he would focus on making four points and leave more time for exchange.	ንግግራቸው ረጅም፣ አሰልች እና በስህተቶች የተሞላ ነበር፡፡	their conversation was long, tedious and full of mistakes.
463	I was too naive to believe him.	አራት ነጥብ ያሉትም 1.	there are four points in 1.
464	His talk was long, boring and full of mistakes.	በፓርቲ አመራር ውስጥ ብዙ ማህበራዊ ችግሮች ይኖራሉ 2.	there are many social problems within the party leadership.
465	His four points were: 1.	የፓርቲው አመራሮች ብዙ ስኬቶች እንዳስመዘገቡ 3.	the party leaders have registered many sectors 3.
466	The party leaders have great achievements; 3. Without the party society would be in chaos; 4.	ያለ ፓርቲ ህብረተሰቡ ማጥ ውስጥ እንደሚዘፈቅ 4 የዜጎች ዲሞክራሲ ከፓርቲው አመራር መነጠል እንደማይችሉ ናቸው፡፡	the non-partisan community is like a honey in a jar, they are unable to demand the democracy of the citizens from the party leader.
467	People's democracy should not be detached from party leadership.	በንግግራቸው መካከልም አንድ ሰው ወደ አዳራሹ ሊገባ ሲል በጠባቂዎች ተከለከለ፡፡	during their argument, a man tried to enter the area and was stopped by the guards.
468	In the middle of his talk, someone tried to enter the hall but was stopped by the security guards.	ከአንድ ሰዓት ከሰላሳ ደቂቃ ንግግር በኋላ ሲማ ናና ንግግራቸውን አቆሙ፡፡	after an hour and thirty minutes of discussion, sima and nana stopped their conversation.
469	The climax was unexpected.	የጥያቄ እና መለስ ጊዜውም ተጀመረ፡፡	the question and answer session has begun.
470	Sima Nan finally had enough of his talk after one and a half hours.	ከኔ ፊት ለፊትም አንድ ብርቱካናማ የስፖርት ልብስ ለበሰ ሰው መናገር ጀመረ፡፡	a man dressed in a strong sports outfit started talking to me face to face.
471	The Q & A session started.	ንግግሩንም ከግሪኩ ፈላስፋ ሶቅራጠስ ንግግር ጠቅሶ ጀመረ፡፡	he started speaking, imitating the eloquent speech of greek philosopher socrates.
472	In front of me a man dressed in orange sport wear started talking.	ዝርዝር ሁኔታዎችን አስገራሚ ስለነበሩ ዘንግቻቸዋለሁ፡፡	i will list them because the conditions were interesting.
473	His main point was about freedom and equality.	የንግግሩ ዋነኛ ነጥብም ነፃነት እና እኩልነት ነበር፡፡	the main theme of the speech was freedom and equality.
474	He said: Today we don't have equality in our rights to speak. I have no freedom.	ምንም እንኳን የተናገሩት ጥሩ ነገር ባይሆንም፣ ወደ ሆቴልዎት መመለስ ይችላሉ፡፡	even if what they said is not good, they can return to their hotel.
475	What you have said are politically correct theories. When you are done, you go back to your hotel.	ነገር ግን እኔ ንግግሩን ብቃወም ትንሽ ጨለማ ክፍል ውስጥ እንደሚዘጋብኝ እርግጠኛ ነኝ ፡፡	however, i am sure that even if i understand the speech, it feels like it is enveloping me in a bit of darkness.
476	If I argue against that I would be locked up in a tiny dark room (This is all I can remember, sorry).	(ይህ እኔ ላስታውስ የቻልኩት ነገር ነው፣ አዝናለሁ) ፡፡	this is what i managed to remember, i'm sorry.
477	Then Sima Nan said that it was not a question. The student then replied, Here comes my question, can I throw my shoe?	ሲማ ናን አስከትለው ይህ ጥያቄ አይደለም አሉ፡፡	this is not the question they asked, they said.
478	Then he threw a sports shoe to the stage with determination.	ተማሪውም ሲመልስ የኔ ጥያቄ ይሄው ነው፣ ጫማየን መወርወር እችላለሁ; ከዛም በቁርጠኝነት የለበሰውን የስፖርት ጫማ ወደ መድረኩ ወረወረ፡፡	"the student replied, ""this is my question, i can tie my shoe; then he carefully tied his sport shoe to his desk."""
479	I clapped my hand without being aware of that…	እኔም ሳላስበው አጨበጭብ ነበር…	i was surprised before i even thought about it...
480	Sima Nan is a Maoist and in the past few years he has kept praising the North Korean model in China to advocate for a stricter approach to foreign policy.	ሲማ ናን ማኦይስት ሲሆኑ ባለፉት ጥቂት አመታት ውስጥ የሰሜን ኮሪያ ሞዴል በጫይናም እንዲዳብር እና በውጭ ጉዳዮች ላይ ጠንካራ አካሄድ እንዲኖር ይፈልጋሉ፡፡	they want north korea to follow china's model and have a strong stance on foreign affairs, which has become a moist sponge in the past few years.
481	He has also propagated a lot of hate speech against liberals, accusing them of being traitors of the country.	በተጨማሪም ለዘብተኞች ላይ የጥላቻ ንግግር በማድረግ እና የሀገሪቱ ስጋቶች ናቸው በሚል ውንጀላቸው ታዋቂ ናቸው፡፡	they are also known for their hostility towards the poor and for their claim that they are the country's burdens.
482	Many have applauded the student's courageous act, but some are also worried about the student's safety.	ብዙ ተማሪዎች የተማሪውን ደፋር ተግባር ያደነቁ ሲሆን አንዳንዶች ግን የተማሪው ደህንነት አሳስቧቸዋል፡፡	many students have undermined the student's behavior, while some have considered the student's safety.
483	Below is my pick of the online discussion :	ከዚህ በታች በድረ ገፅ ስለሁኔታው የነበረውን ውይይት በኔ ምርጫ አቅርቤያለሁ:	i will present the discussion about the situation on the website below at my discretion.
484	慕容雪村: Sima Nan calls himself an intellectual and upholds Maoist ideology.	ምንአልባትም በማኦ ዘመን ስለተካሄደው ማሰቃየት እና ጥቃት ዘንግተውት ይሆናል፡፡	regardless of when it happened, it will be remembered for the celebration and the damage caused.
485	He has probably forgotten about the torture and insult intellectuals went though in the Mao Era - they were forced to wear tall hats and rally on the street, beaten by belts with copper locks, forced into labour on cattle farms to reflect upon their wrongs.	- በዛን ወቅት ሰዎች ረጅም ኮፍያ አጥልቀው በመንገድ ይነዱ ነበር፣ በብረት ቀበቶም ይገረፉ ነበር ፣ከብት በመጠበቅ ስራ ላይ እንዲሰማሩ በማድረግ ስህተታቸውን እንዲያምኑ ይደረጉ ነበር፡፡	at that time, people would walk down the road with long coats on, dragging iron chains, pretending to be busy herding cattle to cover up their mistakes.
486	Zhang Zhixin had his throat cut, Wang Shiwei was buried in a well after a secret execution.	ዛነግ ዚን አንገቱን ተቆርጧል፣ ዋንግ ሰዊ በድብቅ ከተገደለ በኋላ ጉድጓድ ውስጥ ተቀብሯል፡፡	his nose was cut off yesterday, and after he was secretly killed, he was buried in a pit.
487	Lao She and Fu Lei committed suicide… Throwing shoe at him is like a reward.	ላኦ ሺ እና ፉ ሊ ራሳቸውን አጥፍተዋል… ጫማ ወደ እራሳቸው መወርወሩ ለእራሳቸው እንደ ሽልማት ነው፡፡	lao tzu and foucault have annihilated themselves... it is a virtue for them to return their shoes to themselves.
488	吴钩1975: Many are debating about the student's act on Weibo.	吴钩1975￼፡	i'm sorry, but the text you provided is not in amharic. it appears to be a mix of chinese characters and a ge'ez punctuation mark, which is used in amharic and other semitic languages in ethiopia. please provide a correct amharic sentence for translation.
489	Some clapped their hands, some criticized the student for infringing other's rights.	በዊቦ ብዙዎች ስለ ተማሪው ድርጊት እየተከራከሩ ይገኛሉ፡፡	many are debating about the student's behavior on the web.
490	We should have some consensus in understanding the nature of throwing shoes.	አንዳንዶች አጨብጭበዋል፣ ሌሎች ደግሞ የሌሎቹን መብት መጣስ ተገቢ አይደለም እያሉ ይተቻሉ፡፡	some are complaining, others are saying it's not right to violate others' rights.
491	I don't agree that throwing shoes is an attack.	ጫማ ስለመወርወር ጉዳይ ስምምነት ላይ መድረስ ይኖርብናል፡፡	we may have to reach an agreement on the issue of changing shoes.
492	It is just a form of protest by the weak side in a situation when the power is not equal.	እኔ ጫማን መወርወር ጥቃት ነው ብየ አላስብም፤ ይልቅስ ደካማው ወገን ተቃውሞውን የሚገልጽበት መንገድ ነው፡፡	i never thought that wearing shoes was a luxury; rather, it is a way that explains the oppression of the poor.
493	It is quite commonly seen in western countries when people throw eggs at government officials. Don't label the act.	በምዕራብ ሀገሮች ወደ ባለስልጣናት እንቁላል መወርወር በጣም የተለመደ እና እንደ ጥፋት የማይይጠር ድርጊት ነው፡፡	in western countries, it is highly discouraged and considered a disastrous act to rebel against authorities.
494	十年砍柴: One should not cheer for the student.	十年砍柴: ሰዎች በተማሪው ድርጊት ደስ ሊላቸው አይገባም፡፡	people should not be pleased with the student's actions.
495	In western countries, throwing eggs and shoes are common forms of expression and the punishment is light.	በምእራብ ሀገሮች እንቁላል መወርወር መብት አካል ሲሆን ቅጣቱም እዚህ ግባ የማይባል ነው፡፡	in western countries, the right to protest is a fundamental right, and its punishment cannot be enforced here.
496	But in China, the risk is very high.	ነገር ግን በቻይና አደጋው ብዙ ነው፡፡	however, the disaster in china is severe.
497	This time Sima Nan does not have the power to punish the student.	ሲማ ናን ተማሪውን መቅጣት ስልጣን የለውም፡፡	simma does not have the authority to punish the student.
498	But if other hot blooded students are encouraged and decide to throw shoes at those who have real authority, the price is too huge.	ነገር ግን ድርጊቱን እንደ ተሞክሮ በመውሰድ ሌሎች ተማሪዎች ይሄን ድርጊት ስልጣኑ ያላቸው ሰዎች ላይ ከፈፀሙት፤ የሚከፍሉት ዋጋ ከባድ ነው፡፡	however, the cost is heavy on those who have the authority to perform this act, when other students perceive the act as being ignored.

504	Other netizens took to their blogs and YouTube to either condemn or support this bold move in a predominantly conservative society.	ሌሎች የመረብዜጎች ጉዳዩን የራሳቸው ጦማሮች እና ዩቱዩብ ላይ በማዛወር በከፍተኛ ሁኔታ ወግ በሚያጠብቅ ማኅበረሰብ ውስጥ የተከፈተውን ይህንን ገጽ በማውገዝ እና በመደገፍ ሥራ ላይ ተጠምደዋል፡፡	others who have been deeply involved in the issue have been engaged in work by discussing their own experiences and youtube on a highly organized community that maintains this page by subscribing and supporting.
505	The debate about the page has brought up issue such as social media monitoring, HIV/AIDS, religion and African customs, opportunities for Kenyan youth, poverty, greed and peer pressure among Kenyan university students.	ስለገጹ የተነሳው ሙግት የማኅበራዊ አውታሮች ቁጥጥር፣ የኤችአይቪ/ኤድስ፣ ሃይማኖት እና አፍሪካዊ ልምዶች፣ የኬንያውያን ወጣቶች ዕድል፣ ድህነት፣ ብልሹነት እና የአቻ ግፊት በኬንያ ዩንቨርስቲ ተማሪዎች ላይ ያለው ጦስ ለውይይት እንዲነሱ አድርጓል፡፡	the website has prompted discussions on social issues, hiv/aids, religion and african values, the fate of kenyan youths, poverty, corruption and the face of tyranny among students at kenyan universities.
506	The page which was created on 3rd July 2012, has already garnered 50,684 ‘likes’ with 65,830 visitors talking about it.	በጁላይ 3/2012 የተፈጠረው ገጽ ከአሁኑ 50,684 ወዳጆች (‘likes’) እና 65,830 ስለገጹ እያወሩ ያሉ ጎብኝዎችን አግኝቷል፡፡	the page created on july 3, 2012, has now 50,684 friends ('likes') and 65,830 followers who are talking about the page.
507	Kenyanlist, a Kenyan blogger, points out that:	ኬንያንሊስት የተሰኘ/ች ኬንያዊ ጦማሪም ለመጠቆም እንደሞከረው/ችው፡	the kenyan artist named kenyanlist has reportedly started preparations for a concert.
508	But Solomonirush says that the page is all but a ploy by some canny netizens to take advantage of young Kenyan students.	ሰሎሞንሪሽ ግን ገጹ አሁንም ቢሆን በአንዳንድ ሸረኛ የመረብዜጎች የተፈጠረና በኬንያዊ ወጣት ተማሪዎች ላይ የሚያላግጥ የውሸት ገጽ ነው፡፡	however, solomon's page, even now, is a hoax page created by some pranksters and affecting kenyan student followers.
509	The blogger reports:	ይህ/ች ጦማሪ እንደሚለው/ትለው፡	as this drummer says.
510	My investigations reveal that this page, and probably others of the same kind, is administrated by canny people seeking to make money.	ምርመራዬ እንደሚያረጋግጠው፣ ይሄ ገጽ እና ሌሎችም እንዲህ ያሉት ገንዘብ ማግኘት በሚፈልጉ ሸረኞች የተፈጠሩ ናቸው፡፡	as my research indicates, this page and others like it were created for travelers seeking to earn such money.
511	I have also seen other pages where dating and sex is the subject of concern, and due to the high number of likes by the audience, they charge to do advertisements on the page.	ሌሎችም ስለ መቃጠር (dating) እና ወሲብ የሚያወሩ ገጾችን አይቻለሁ፡፡ እናም በሚያፈሯቸው ብዙ ወዳጆች ገጹ ላይ ማስታወቂያ እያስቀመጡ ገንዘብ ይቀበላሉ፡፡	i've seen other pages talking about dating and sex. and they are making money by posting ads on their page that many of their followers like.
512	The cunning administrators expose the young students, who are willing to adventure, into perils of sexual abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, and kidnapping.	ሸረኞቹ የገጾቹ አስተዳዳሪዎች ለጀብዱ/ታይታ የተዘጋጁ ወጣት ተማሪዎችን ያታልሏቸውና ለፆታዊ ጥቃት፣ ለተላላፊ በሽታዎች እና መታገት ጭምር ያጋልጧቸዋል፡፡	the guards and administrators of the prison have exposed the young students who were prepared for the protest to sexual violence, recurrent diseases, and frequent beatings.
513	The social media buzz about the page has led those opposing it to create a Facebook group called Anti-Campus Divas for Rich Men.	ስለገጹ የተጧጧፈው ውይይት ገጹን የሚቃወሙት የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞች ተቃዋሚ የተሰኘ የፌስቡክ ገጽ እንዲከፍቱ አስገድዷቸዋል፡፡	"the discussion about the page, which was criticized, prompted the campus critics to open a facebook page called ""opposition to the rich""."
514	A Kenyan blogger, Kenya-post, reports:	ኬንያ-ፖስት በሚል የሚጠራ/ትጠራ ኬንያዊ በጦማሩ/ሯ፡	called kenya-post, it is a kenyan in the tomato.
515	The second group, Anti-Campus Divas for Rich Men operates on contrary principles of the first one.	ሁለተኛው ቡድን (የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞች ተቃዋሚ) በመጀመሪያው ቡድን ተቃራኒ መርሕ ይሠራል፡፡	the second team (campus qeweti-chicos opposition for the wealthy) competes against the first team.
516	As the first preaches sex, sex, sex and cash, it promotes chastity and encourages young people to abstain.	የመጀመሪያው ወሲብ፣ ወሲብ፣ ወሲብ እና ገንዘብ ሲሰብክ ይህንኛው ደግሞ ጨዋነትን በማስተዋወቅ፣ ወጣቶች እንዲታቀቡ ያበረታታል፡፡	the first sex, sex, sex and money when combined, this also encourages boys to be cautious by creating awareness.
517	Whereas the first group rides high with over 20,000 likes in there Facebook page, the Anti- Campus Divas for Rich Men only has 5,000.	የመጀመሪያው 20,000 ወዳጆች ፌስቡክ ላይ ሲያገኝ ተቃዋሚው ግን 5,000ዎች ብቻ ወደውታል፡፡	the first competitor reached 20,000 friends on facebook, but the opponent only reached 5,000.
518	Other Facebook pages opposed to Campus Divas For Rich Men include Decent Divas Against Campus Divas for Rich Men and Dislike Campus Divas for Rich Men, Campus Divas For Broke Men With Rich Love.	የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞች የተሰኘውን ገጽ የተቃወሙ ሌሎች የፌስቡክ ገጾች ውስጥ እነጨዋ ቀወጢ-ቺኮች የካምፓስ ቀወጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞችን” ይቃወማሉ እና የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞችን አንፈልግም፣ የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች የፍቅር ሀብታም ለሆኑ ችስታ ወንዶች የሚሉ ይገኙበታል፡፡	"""other facebook pages that have protested the page called 'campus chicks for the rich' include those that say 'we don't want campus chicks for the rich' and 'campus chicks for men who have become rich through love' can be found."""
519	A number of Kenyans on Twitter have condemned hypocrisy over their reactions and stated that Kenyans need to vote for leaders who will increase the Higher Education Loans Board Allowance for less well off partners to be able to date the girls:	ይህንን ተከትሎ በርካታ ኬንያውያን በትዊተር ላይ ምላሻቸውን ሲያሰፍሩ ኬንያውያን ለከፍተኛ ትምህርት መማርያ ብድር ማግኘት የሚቻልበትን መንገድ የሚያመቻች መሪ እንዲመርጡና የሚፈልጉት ሴት መጥበስ እንዲችሉ ጠይቀዋል፡	following this, many kenyans on twitter have asked for a leader who can pave the way for them to obtain high education loans and for the woman they want to arrive.
520	@clansewe: To all Kenyans railing against the 'Campus Divas for Rich Men page, stop your hypocrisy.	@clansewe: የ‹ካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞች› ገጽን የምትቃወሙ ኬንያውያን ሁሉ ዝባዝንኬያችሁን አቁሙ፡፡	all kenyans who are boycotting the 'campus diva-chics for rich men' page, keep your boycott going.
521	We all Kenyans have put cash above everything!	ኬንያውያን ሁላችንም፣ ገንዘብን ከምንም በላይ እናስቀድማለን!	we kenyans, we prioritize money above all else!
522	@kevoice: We will vote 4 leaders who will increase the HELB allowance so that we can be able to date Campus Divas 4 Rich Men. #TujipangeKisiasa	@kevoice: የከፍተኛ ትምህርት ብድር ( HELB ) የሚያሳድግልንን መሪ በመምረጥ ለሀብታሞች የተዘጋጁትን የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ማውጣት አለብን፡፡	we need to elect a leader who can negotiate for us the higher education loans board (helb) and remove the campus chicks prepared for the rich.
523	@mwendembae: @lionsroar101 So now there is a fb page called anti-campus divas for rich men.	@mwendembae: @lionsroar101 አሁን ደግሞ የ‹ካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞችን ተቃዋሚ› የፌስቡክ ገጽ ተፈጠረ ማለት ነው፤ ገርሞኛል፣ እኔኮ ልከሰት ነበር #idlers	now, a facebook page called 'campus change-chicos for the rich opponents' has been created; it's annoying, i should have created it myself #idlers
524	Ha, I'm amused.”was bound to happen #idlers	ይህ አስተያየት በሌሎችም ገጹን በተቃወሙ የመረብዜጎች ተንፀባርቋል፡	this opinion has been echoed by other netizens who criticized the page.
525	@thatguydavy: Campus divas for rich men......and you wonder why hurricanes are named after women!	@thatguydavy: የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞች…… እና አሁን ለምን ማዕበል በሴቶች እንደተሰየመ ገባችሁ!	campus chicks for the rich... and now why has the feast been set for women, you understand!
526	@mpalele: The sad part abt this Campus Divas for Rich Men is that they think 50K , coffee java and a trip 2 naivasha is the definition of a rich man.	@mpalele: ስለነዚህ የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞች አሳዛኙ ጉዳይ 50,000፣ ቡና እና ጥቂት ጉዞ የሀብታም ሰው ትርጉም ይመስላቸዋል፡፡	about these campus changes - for the rich, the matter of 50,000, coffee and a little journey may seem like a rich man's interpretation.
527	@rmresh: Campus Divas For Rich Men....desparation at its best.... @nochiel: @savvykenya Please be warned that the abhorrent Campus Divas For Rich Men page is using your old profile pic	@nochiel: @savvykenya የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞች  ላይ ያሉ ፎቶዎች የቀድሞ የፕሮፋይል ስዕሎቻችሁ ሊሆኑ ስለሚችሉ ተጠንቀቁ፡፡	be careful, the photos of campus chicks could become your old profile pictures because they can be on the rich.
528	KTN Kenya, a television station in Kenya, used the YouTube platform to portray the Facebook page as a prostitution ring and campus students interviewed say that this is nothing out of the ordinary:	የኬቲን ቴሌቪዥን፣ የዩትዩብ አለፈመደብ (platform)በመጠቀም የፌስቡክ ገጹ የሴተኛ አዳሪነት ደወል እንደሆነ እና የካምፓስ ተማሪዎችን ሲጠየቁ ይህ ከተለመደው ውጪ አለመሆኑን ሲናገሩ አሳይቷል፡	ketin television, using the youtube platform, has shown that there has been a surge in the number of female followers on its facebook page and when campus students were asked, they indicated that this is beyond expectation.
529	Campus Divas For Rich Men is so far the boldest move in discussing matters involving Kenyan youth and sexuality openly in such a traditionally conservative society.	የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞች በእንደዚህ ያለ ወግ አጥባቂ ማኅበረሰብ ውስጥ የኬንያ ወጣቶችን እና ወሲባዊ ተግባርን በተመለከተ በግልፅ ውይይትን በጉልህ ያራመደ ለመሆን በቅቷል፡፡	the campus qewti-chikos has been striving to become a vigilant community for the rich, discussing kenyan youth and sexual behavior in a clear and honest manner.
530	So far, bloggers from 95 countries are ready to type with fast and fit fingers.	እንግዲህ ከ95 ሀገሮች የተውጣጡ ጦማሪያን በነዛ ብቁ እና ፈጣን እጆቻቸው ሊከትቡ ተዘጋጅተዋል፡፡	so, the competitors from 95 countries are prepared to compete with their sufficient and fast hands.

542	After witnessing its biggest protest, the anonymous organizers of the Dignity March called for another one.	ትልቁን አመጽ ከተመለከቱ በኋላ ህቡዓኑ የክብር ሰልፍ” አዘጋጆች ሌላ የተቃውሞ ጥሪ አቀረቡ፡፡	"after considering the major challenge, the organizers of the ""honor parade"" presented another protest call."
543	Tens of thousands showed up in the areas of Mishref and Sabah Al-Salem protesting the Kuwaiti ruler's amendment of the voting law, which now allows a citizen to vote for one candidate instead of four.	የኪዌት መሪዎች የመምረጥ መብት ህግን በመከለሳቸው በሚሽረፍ እና ሳባህ አል ሳሌም አከባቢዎች በአስር ሺዎች የሚቆጠሩ ሰዎች ተቃውሟቸውን ሲያሰሙ ታይተዋል፡፡ ይህ ህግ አንድ ዜጋ ለአራት እጩ ተወዳዳሪዎች የሚሰጠውን ድምጽ ወደ አንድ ያወርደዋል፡፡	the leaders of kuwait have been seen violating the law that gives the right to vote, causing an uproar in mishref and sabah al salem neighborhoods, where tens of thousands of people are counted. this law reduces the voice given to one member to four supporters to one.
544	Protesters did not find the Amir's decree constitutional and believe the new law is made to play with the coming elections in December and to weaken the opposition that won most of the parliament's seats earlier this year.	ተቃዋሚዎቹ የአሚሩን ውሳኔ ሕገ መንግስታዊ ሆኖ አላገኙትም አዲሱ ህግ የተዘጋጀው በዚህ ዓመት ቀድሞ አብዛኛውን የፓርላማ ወንበር ያሸነፈውን ተቃዋሚ ፓርቲ በመጪው ታህሳስ በሚካሂደው ምርጫ ላይ ለማዳከም ነው ብለው ያምናሉ፡፡	the opposition did not find the decision of the mayor to be constitutional. the new law, which was prepared this year, has defeated most of the parliamentary board of the opposition party, which they believe is to compete in the upcoming election in december.
545	Like the previous march, Sunday's protest witnessed smoke and tear gas bombs and several arrests of protesters, who were later released.	እንደ መጀመሪያው ሰልፍ ዕለተ ሰንበት የአስለቃሽ ጢስ እና ቦንቦችን ሰለባ የሆኑ ሲሆን በርካቶችም ከታሰሩ በኋላም መለቀቃቸው ታውቋል፡፡	as in the first parade, it is known that many were arrested and beaten on sunday, including your leader's t-shirt and balloons.
546	Who is leading the protests?	ተቃውሞውን የሚመራው ማነው ?	who is leading the protest?
547	In the past few years, protests were criticized because they were led by opposition MPs.	ባለፉት ጥቂት አመታት አመጸኞቹ በተቃዋሚ የፓርላማ አባላት በመመራታቸው ትችት ደርሶባቸዋል፤ በኋላ ወጣቶቹ የተቃውሞው መሪዎች ለመሆን ጥረት አድርገዋል፡፡	in the past few years, the protesters have succeeded in overthrowing parliamentary members they opposed; subsequently, the protesters have made efforts to become the leaders of the opposition.
548	Lately, the youth tried to be the leaders of those protests. This shift got bigger numbers to show up for those dignity marches.	ይህ ለውጥ የክብር ሰልፎች ላይ የተሳተፉ ሰዎች ቁጥር እንዲያሻቅብ አድርጎታል፡፡	this change has caused the number of people who participated in the parades of honor to decrease.
549	What is interesting though is that an anonymous Twitter account is the one deciding dates of both marches and the meeting points.	ሌላው አስገራሚ የሚያደርገው ነገር ደግሞ የሁለቱም ሰልፎች ቀንና መነሻ ቦታ የተወሰነው በህቡዕ የትዊተር ገጽ መሆኑ ነው፡፡	another interesting thing is that both campaigns have a designated day and starting point on a large twitter page.
550	The account @KarametWatan tweeted a message on the 24th of October to Twitter not to revel their identity to the Kuwaiti authorities:	ጥቅምት 24 @KarametWatan (በአረብኛ የሀገር ክብር) የተሰኘ የትዊተር ገጽ ትዊተር ማንነታቸውን ለኪዌት መንግስት አሳልፎ እንዳይገልጥ የሚጠይቅ መልዕክት በትዊተር አስተላለፈ፡፡	on october 24, a twitter page named @karametwatan (which means 'country's honor' in arabic) sent a message on twitter asking not to reveal their twitter identity to the kuwaiti government.
551	We the people of Kuwait ask you to protect the privacy of our account details of @karametwatan from all/any officials seeking the information of the owners and/or IP addresses of the persons using and posting from the mentioned account.	እኛ የኪዌት ህዝቦች የገጻችንን @karametwatan ግለኝነት እና ዝርዝር መረጃዎች በዚህ ገጽ ተጠቅሞ የሚለጥፍን ግለሰብ የበየነመረብ አድራሻ (IP addresses) ከሚፈልጉ ከሁሉም / ከማንኛውም ባለስልጣናት እንዲትጠብቁልን እንጠይቃለን፡፡	we, the people of kuwait, will ask all authorities to keep our @karametwatan individuality and list information, including the ip addresses of anyone who uses this page, from anyone who wants it.
552	We are responsible for the organization of a march called Dignity of a Nation in Kuwait, the largest ever march in the history of Kuwait calling for democracy, human rights, and fight against corruption.	በኪዌት ታሪክ ከመቼውም ጊዜ የበለጠ ቁጥር ያለው ዴሞክራሲ፣ ሰብዓዊ መብቶችን እና ሙስናን መዋጋት የጠየቀውን ክብር ለሀገራችን” የተሰኘውን ሰልፍ የማዘጋጀቱን ሃላፊነት እንወስዳለን፡፡	"""we will take responsibility for organizing the march called 'honor for our country', which demands more democracy, human rights, and justice than ever in the history of kuwait."""
553	The turn-out reached over 150,000 (around 11.5% of citizens of Kuwait) that stunned the government.	ይህ ግልብጥ ብሎ የወጣው ከ150, 000 በላይ ቁጥር ያለው ህዝብ(ከጠቅላላው የከዌት ዜጋ 11.	this means that over 150,000 people (11% of the total population of kuwait) have come out in droves.
554	In return the government ordered their forces to attack the peaceful demonstration in a brutal manner that was never been seen before for no reason.	በምላሹም መንግስት በአውሬነት፣ ያለምክንያት፣ ከዚህ በፊት ታይቶ በማይታወቅ መልኩ ይህን ሰላማዊ ሰልፍ እንዲያጠቁ ሀይሎቹን አዟል፡፡	in his message, the government, without any justification, used its power to suppress this peaceful protest in an unprecedented manner.

559	Should Bahrainis support Kuwaitis?	ባህሬናውያን ኪዌቶችን ደግፈዋልን?	have we defeated the bahir dar fans?
560	Considering the sectarian remarks and support of Kuwaiti opposition figures for the Bahraini regime against the February 14th revolution, the Shia of Kuwait do not want to protest next to the opposition.	የጎጠኞቹን ሐተታ ግምታ ውስጥ በማሰገባትና የኪዌት ተቃዋሚ መሪዎች የጥር 14 አብዮት የባህሬንን ስርዓት በመደገፋቸው፤ የኪዌት ሻይቶች ከተቃዋሚዎች ጎን ሆነው መሰለፍ አይፈልጉም፡፡	by incorporating the advice of the elders and the leaders of the kuwait opposition, who overthrew the bahraini regime on february 14; the kuwaiti sites do not want to be against the opposition.
561	This, in result, influenced the Shia of Bahrain and started a discussion on whether Bahrainis should or should not support Kuwaiti marches.	በውጤቱም የተፅእኖ ወስጥ የወደቀው ባህሬናዊ ሻይት ሰልፉን መደገፍ እንዳለባቸውና መደገፍ እንደሌለባቸው ውይይት ጀምሯል፡፡	the discussion has begun on whether they have the right to protest the fall of the traditional hut in its result and whether they do not have the right to protest.

599	Which United Nations Human Rights Council?	የትኛው የተባበሩት መንግስታት የሰብአዊ መብት ኮሚሽን!	which united nations human rights commission!
600	Is it not worrisome that an Ethiopian sense of discomfiture is not shared by our government?	እኔ የምለው ኢትዮጵያዊው የዩልኝታ ባህላችን ያለው ህብረተሰቡ ዘንድ ብቻ መሆኑ በጣም አሳሳቢ ችግር አይመስላችሁም?	don't you think it's a very alarming problem that the ethiopian unity we talk about only exists in our cultural festivals?
601	If our government had any Ethiopian sense of discomfiture, they would have rejected when they got elected as a member the United Nations Human Rights Council!	እንዴ መንግስት እኮ ይሉኝታ ቢኖረው ኖሮ ተመድ የሰባዊ መብት ኮሚሽን አባል አድርጌ መርጨሀለሁ!	if there was a government that listened to me, i would have resigned as a member of the human rights commission!
602	They would have admitted that the Ethiopian government would not fit in the Human Rights Council but our government never had an Ethiopian sense of discomfiture and accepted the membership to United Nations Human Rights Council gladly!	” ሲለው… አረ በህግ አምላክ እኔ አልሆናችሁም ሀገር ተሳስታችሁ ነው! ወይ ደግሞ ባታውቁኝ ነው የመረጣችሁኝ…! ” ማለት ነበረበት።	"""he said... oh, by law, god, i am not your country, you are confused! or else, you chose me because you don't know me...!"" that's what he meant."

"""however, because my kingdom is not created by saying 'amen', we were told that we are human rights defenders like this in public when we were ridiculed for accepting it; 'what does my kingdom say to me?"""
604	Zerihun Tesfaye, an exiled journalist and blogger, described the conundrum of Ethiopia’s election in an extended Amharic note on Facebook:	በደረሰበት ጫና ከሀገር የተሰደደው ጋዜጠኛ እና ጦማሪ ዘሪሁን ተስፋዬ በፌስቡክ ገጹ ይህን ለማመን የሚከብድ ‘የኢትዮጵያ መመረጥ’ እንዲህ ሲል ገልጾታል፡፡	the journalist and musician zerihun tesfaye, who was expelled from the country, expressed his disbelief on his facebook page about the 'choosing ethiopia' campaign that came about.
605	Let me chant, I can’t, I can’t as she has forgotten my cause!	እስቲ ልነሳና ልበል አልቸም አልቸም	come on, let's get up and go. i said no, no.
606	Says a local songster.	እሷ የኔን ነገር ትተዋለች መቼም የሠፈራችን አዝማሪ።	she will leave my things whenever she gets tired of our quarrel.
607	I find it easy to join this local songster and chant with him when we fall upon international organizations and governments who deafen their ears to our cause!	አንዲህ ነገር ዓለሙን የተዉ ግለሰቦች፣ ዓለም አቀፍ ተቋማት እና መንግሥታት ሲያጋጥሙ አዝማሪውን ተቀብሎ ማንጎራጎሩ ሳይቀል አይቀርም።	individuals who have abandoned such a world, international organizations and governments cannot stop praising the musician when they meet.
608	But paradoxically, sometimes international organizations have a better understanding than Ethiopians themselves, about horrendous human right situations in Ethiopia and we feel better as we consider the international community is recognizing our great efforts.	ስለኢትዮጵያ መንግሥት ሰብዓዊ መብት ረገጣ አንዳንዴ እኛን ባለጉዳዮቹን በሚያስደንቅ ኹኔታ የዓለም ዓቀፉ ማኅበረሰብ ሲያቀነቅን ወይ ጉድ ለካንስ እነዚህ ሰዎች የልብ አውቃ ኖረዋል ብለን ተስፋ እናደርጋለን።	sometimes we hope that these people have a heart when the international community is shocked by the human rights violations of the ethiopian government or when the situation of the victims is heartbreaking.
609	Sometimes we even think the international community is part of the revolution we aspire to in Ethiopia and our hearts fill with joy!	አንድ ቀን የለውጡ አካል ሆነው የነጻነታችንን እንቀዳጃለን ብለንም ልባችን በሐሴት ትሞላለች።	one day, even if we say we will sacrifice our freedom as a sacrificial body, our heart will be filled with joy.
610	So through journalism we used to report a lot on human rights abuse in Ethiopia.	እናም የጋዜጠኝነት ሙያችንም የረዳንን ያህል የማቃጠር ሥራ እንሠራለን።	we will also do as much work as we can to reduce our journalism skills.
611	For instance, if we report fifty innocent Ethiopians are jailed in a famous prison called Kality” some of the international community members correct us with more accurate number (120) of innocent prisoners including their names!	ሌሎች የማይጠቀሱ ጉዳዮች ተደራርበው ትላንት የተባበሩት መንግሥታት የሰብዓዊ መብቶች ካውንስል ይህቺን በሰብዓዊ መብት አያያዝ የማትጠረጠር አገር አባል አድርጎ ሲመርጥ ግን የሠፈሬን አዝማሪ ማስታወስ ግድ አለኝ።	however, i feel obliged to note the irony when the united nations human rights council, which was established yesterday, chooses a country that does not respect human rights as a member, while other unresolved issues are being sidelined.
612	Then we feel these people are with us and hope good things are yet to come!	በእውነት እነዚህ የመብት ተሟጋቾች እና ተቋማት ተስፋ ሊያስቆርጡን እየሞከሩ ነው?	are these human rights violators and institutions really trying to dash our hopes?
613	But when I heard of the news of Ethiopia’s election to the United Nations Human Rights Council last evening, the hymn of our local songster rang a bell!	ወይስ በየትኛውም መስፈርት አገርን ለማስተዳደር ብቃቱ የሌለው ቦዘኔ መንግሥት ምን አልባት አባል ሲሆን የጠባይ ለውጥ ያመጣ ይኾን ብለው?	or, regardless of the system, what difference would a member of a bozene government, which is incapable of managing the country, bring about?
614	Are these intergovernmental human rights organizations trying to destroy our optimism?	አሁን አሁን እየተፎጋግርን ያለን ያህል ተሰማኝ።	i am as tired as we are arguing now.
615	Or do they think a bad-mannered government will get better when it becomes a member of United Nations Human Rights Council?	ክፋቱ አሁንም የእነሱን ድጋፍ የምንፈልግ መሆናችን፤ የለማኝ ስልቻ ቢንከባለል ከለማኝ ደጅ እንዲሉ።	our need for their support despite their harm; it's like expecting a call from a phone that's been disconnected.
616	Nowadays I feel everybody has become politically correct to everybody!	ሌላው ያገባኛል ያለው የበየነ መረብ ቀበኛ ዮሐንስ ሞላ ይህን ጻፈ፡፡	the other network subscriber, johannes, who said he would marry me, wrote this.
617	But the worse thing is still we need their help!	እማር በሰር ጫሪም፣ ጒቸ ገግት ቧሪም፡፡	i don't know.
618	And another concerned netizen, Yohanes Molla, wrote :	” የጉራግኛ ተረትና ምሳሌ (ወማካ) ነው፡፡	it is a guragigna proverb and example (wamaka).
619	There is a local proverb which says: A fool makes a donkey carry red meat and sends her along with a hyena!	ወደ አማርኛ ሲመጣ አህያ ላይ ስጋ ጭነው፣ ጅብን ሸኝ አሉት፡፡	when it comes to amharic, they said he is a donkey carrying meat, a sleeping hyena.
620	So the hyena will chomp through the red meat and later turn on the donkey!	እንግዲህ ይህ ሲሆን ውጤቱ ግልፅ ነው፡፡	so, given this, the result is clear.
621	However, when I woke up this morning I could not escape this story!	ምናልባት አህያዋንም ጠግቦ ካቆያት ነው እንጂ እርሷንም በጊዜ ይበላታል፡፡	perhaps he feeds her mule but he will eat her when the time comes.
622	It keeps coming back to me and makes my day horrific!	ትናንት ማምሻውን በእንቅልፍ ልቤ አንብቤው….	i spent last night reading it in my sleep….
623	So what could better describe Ethiopia’s election to United Nations Human Rights Council other than the proverb I cited above!	’ እያልኩ ተኝቼ፣ ዛሬ ስነቃ እውን ሆኖ የደገመኝና እስካሁን ድረስ በአህምሮዬ ላይ ተተክሎ ቀኔን ያጠቆረብኝና፣ እያቃጨለብኝ ያለውን ኢትዮጵያ የተመድ የሰብዓዊ መብት ካውንስል አባል የመሆን ወሬ ጉዳይ ከዚህ ተረትና ምሳሌ የተሸለ ምን ይገልፀው ይሆን?	as i said, i went to bed and woke up today, the news of ethiopia becoming a member of the human rights council, which has been haunting and following me in my consciousness, and which has been bothering me, what does it signify beyond this story and example?
624	Jawar Mohammed wrote a detailed analysis of how Ethiopia secured a seat in the council.	ዳንኤል ብርሃነ ግን የኢትዮጵያን የምክር ቤት አባልነት ከሚቃወሙት ጋር አይስማማም፡፡	daniel berhane, however, does not agree with those who question his membership in the ethiopian advisory council.
625	But Daniel Berehane disagreed with those opposing Ethiopia's membership to the council:	የኢትዮጵያ ለተባበሩት መንግስታት ሰብዓዊ መብቶች ምክር ቤት መመረጥ ምንም ጥመት አላየኹበትም፡፡	i have not seen any objection to ethiopia's election to the united nations human rights council.
626	I see no anomaly with Ethiopia being elected to the UN Human Rights Council. Both Ethiopia and the Council have good Constitutions.	ሁለቱም፤ ኢትዮጵያም ምክር ቤቱም ጥሩ ሀገ መንግስት አላቸው፡፡	both; ethiopia and its council have a good government.
627	They both have capacity (political, financial, etc) limitations implementing it.	ሁለቱም ለትግበራ የአቅም (ፖለቲካዊ፣ የገንዘብ ወዘተ.	both are for performance (political, financial, etc.).
628	Perfect match.	ፍጹም ጥምረት!	complete silence!
629	Human rights groups have been criticizing Ethiopia as one of the most serious human rights violators in Africa with huge number of dissidents, activists and journalists languishing in jail.	ኢትዮጵያ የሰብዓዊ መብት ተሟጋቾች ከፍተኛ የሰብዓዊ መብት ጥሰት ያካሄዳሉ ብለው ከሚከሷቸው የአፍሪካ ሀገሮች አንዷ ስትሆን በተጨማሪም በርካታ ተቃዋሚዎች፣ አራማጆችና ጋዜጠኞች በወህኒ የሚሰቃዩባት ናት፡፡	ethiopia is one of the african countries that are heavily criticized for serious human rights abuses, and additionally, many opposition members, journalists, and activists are imprisoned.
630	The reports have not been received well by some netizens.	ይህ የባቡር መሥመር የአቡነ ጴጥሮስንና የዐፄ ምኒሊክን ሐውልት እንዲነሡ ያደርጋል?	will this line of pepper make abune petros and emperor menelik stand up?
631	It was in 1896 that Ethiopian forces led by Emperor Menelik II had defeated an Italian army with better contemporary military technology at the Battle of Adwa.	በወቅቱ የኢትዮጵያ ንጉሰ ነገስት የነበሩት አጼ ምኒልክ መላውን የኢትዮጵያ ህዝብ ከጎናቸው አሰልፈው የጊዜውን ዘመናዊ መሳሪያ የታጠቀውን የጣሊያን ጦር አድዋ ላይ ድል አደረጉ፡፡	at the time, emperor menelik ii of ethiopia, who had armed the entire ethiopian people from their resources, defeated the modern italian army at the battle of adwa.
632	Subsequently, the victorious Emperor had brought in a range of technologies including railway to transform his country.	በቀሪው የንግስና ዘመናቸው ደግሞ በዘመኑ መንፈስ የተቃኙ ብዙ ስራቸውን ሲያከናወኑ የባቡር መስመርን ጨምሮ በርካታ ስልጣኔዎች ወደሀገራችን እንዲገቡ ጥረት በማድረግ አሳልፈዋል፡፡	they have also succeeded in bringing many authorities, including the railway line, to our country by working hard on many of their tasks that are in line with the spirit of the times during their reign.
633	For his triumph at Adwa and for his endeavor to change Ethiopia in his own ways, a statue in his honor was erected at the center of Addis Ababa called Arada.	ለዚህ የአድዋ ድልና ሀገሪቱ ዘመናዊ እንድትሆን ላደረጉት ጥረት መታሰቢያ ይሆን ዘንድ ይህ ሐውልት በመሐል አዲስ አበባ አራዳ ጊዮርጊስ ቆመላቸው፡፡	this monument was erected in arada giorgis, addis ababa, to commemorate the victory of adwa and to make the country modern.
634	The statute of Emperor Menelik II in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.	ኢትዮጵያን ወረረ፡፡	he invaded ethiopia.
635	Almost forty years later, in 1935, the Italians launched a new but a prearranged military campaign endorsed by their then belligerent leaders.	ከመጀመሪያዎቹ ኢትዮጵያውን ጳጳሳት አንዱ የሆኑት ብፁዕ አቡነ ጴጥሮስ እጃቸውን ተይዘው ማርሻል ግራዚያኒ ፊት ቀረቡ፡፡	one of the first ethiopian patriarchs, the blessed abune petros, was taken and brought before the italian marshal.
636	The Italians managed to have a brief military occupation of Ethiopia but faced a staunch resistance from Ethiopians.	የኢትዮጵያ መሬት ጠላትን ብትቀበል የተረገመች ትሁን፡፡	if the land of ethiopia accepts an enemy, it will be cursed.
637	Pope Abune Petros, who was among the first Popes of Ethiopian Orthodox Church, was the leading figure of the resistance in Ethiopia.	በፈጣሪዬ ኢየሱስ ክርስቶስ ስም የተወገዘች ትሁን፡፡ ” ብለው ተናገሩ፡፡	"""may she be blessed in the name of my creator jesus christ,"" they said."
638	The Italians never liked what he was doing as a patriot and tried to stop him.	ከዚያ በማርሻል ግራዚያኒ ትእዛዝ በስምንት ጥይት ተደብድበው ወደቁ፡፡	after that, they fell by the command of graziani in the eighth battle.
639	He was forced to appear before General Rodolfo Graziani to submit and declare the Ethiopian patriots as bandits.	አለመሞታቸው ሲታወቅ ከግራዚያኒ አዛዦች አንዱ በሦስት የሽጉጥ ጥይት ራሳቸውን በመምታት ገደላቸው፡፡	when their survival was known, one of the graziani commanders killed themselves with three shots of a pistol.
640	He refused to comply with their demand and condemned the aggressors instead. He asked Ethiopians to struggle for their freedom. Finally, the Italians executed him in public.	ይህን ለሀገር ነጻነት የከፈሉትን መስዋዕትነት ለማዘከር በግፍ ከተገደሉበት ቦታ በቅርብ ርቀት ሐውልት ተሰራላቸው፡፡	a monument was built near the place where they were brutally killed for their sacrifice for the freedom of this country.
641	As it was done with Emperor Menelik II, a statue of Abune Petros was built at the center of Addis Ababa as reminiscent of his unwavering stand for his country.	ይሁንና ከቻይናው ሪልዌይ ግሩፕ ሊሚትድ ጋር በመተባበር የከተማ ባቡር መስመር ለመዘርጋት ያቀደው የኢትዮጵያ መንግስት እነዚህን ሁለት ሐውልቶች ሊያፈርስ መዘጋጁቱ ብዙ ኢትዮጵያውያንን አስቆጥቷል፡፡	the ethiopian government's preparation to privatize these two sectors, following its agreement with china's railway group limited to expand urban bus lines, has alarmed many ethiopians.
642	However, unconfirmed reports are circulating online that the two iconic statues found on an historical thoroughfare might get wrecked due to an Addid Ababa rail tunnel construction project.	ስለኢትዮጵያ ታሪክ ባሕል እምነት ፖለቲካ እና ትውፊት ምልከታውን የሚያቀርበው ዳንኤል ክብረት መሠረታዊ ጥያቄውን በማስቀድም ትችቱን አስከተለ፡፡	daniel, who presents his perspective on ethiopia's history, culture, faith, politics, and prosperity, has highlighted his basic question by defining his purpose.
643	The reports have not been received well by some netizens.	ይህ የባቡር መሥመር የአቡነ ጴጥሮስንና የዐፄ ምኒሊክን ሐውልት እንዲነሡ ያደርጋል?	will this line of pepper make abune petros and emperor menelik rise from the grave?
644	The statute of Pope Abune Petros in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.	ለዚህ ጥያቄ ምላሹ ‹አዎን› ከሆነ ስለ ባቡሩ የሚኖረን ግምት ይለያል፡፡	if the answer to this question is 'yes', it will distinguish the mystery about the west.
645	Daniel Kiberet, a blogger who usually write on culture, history and spirituality of Ethiopia, asks :	ኢትዮጵያን እናሳድጋለን ስንል ያሳደጓትን እየዘነጋንና መታሰቢያቸውን እያፈረስን መሆን የለበትም፡፡	there is no way we can say we will save ethiopia while we are narrowing those who saved her and erasing their memory.
646	Will the Addis Ababa rail lines construction destroy the statues of Emperor Menelik II & martybishop Abune Petros?	‹በማን ላይ ቆመሽ እግዜርን ታሚያለሽ› አለ ያገሬ ሰው፡፡	"""who are you standing against, you will lose to god,"" said the man from my country."
647	If the answer to this question is yes, our stance for the rail lines construction would be different!	የምናመጣው አዲስ ነገር ባለን ላይ የሚጨመር እንጂ ያለንን የሚያጠፋ መሆን የለበትም፡፡	what we bring is to add to what we have, not to erase what we have.
648	Our development should not come at the expense of the statues of forefathers of Ethiopia who have given their life for the country!	መኪና ያስፈልገናል፣ ግን እግር የሚቆርጥ መሆን የለበትም፡፡	we need a car, but there is no need to cut off the leg.
649	What we put in for development should reflect on what we already have, it should not destroy what we have.	ይህን ታሪክና ቅርስ እያጠፉና እያበላሹ የሚመጣ ለውጥ አንገት ቆርጦ ፀጉርን እንደማስተካከል ነው የሚቆጠረው፡፡	the change that comes by erasing and eating this history and tradition is like cutting the neck and combing the hair.
650	We might need vehicles but the vehicles should not cut off our feet.	እናም የሚመለከታቸው ሁሉ ወደ ርምጃ ከመግባታቸው በፊት ሦስት ጊዜ ሊያስቡ ይገባል፡፡	and all those who look at them should think three times before they enter into temptation.
651	Whether we like it or not Ethiopia is a country with rich history and heritage and these are foundations for our survival and continuation.	መቼም የመጀመርያውን ባቡር ያስገቡትን የዐፄ ምኒሊክን ሐውልት አፍርሶ ባቡር እናስገባ ማለት የታሪክ ምጸት ነው፡፡	the historical significance is that they replaced the statue of emperor menelik, which was first installed, with a lion statue after it was destroyed.
652	So constructing rail lines at the cost of Ethiopia’s iconic figures is like going to a barber shop for hair cut after amputating one’s head!	ለነጻነት የተሠውትን የአቡነ ጴጥሮስ ሐውልት ነቅሎ በባቡር ላይ በነጻነት ለመሄድ መከጀል ግፍ መሥራት ነው የሚሆነው፡፡	starting a journey to freedom by raising the banner of abune petros, who was sacrificed for freedom, on a ship is an act of injustice.
653	The project group should think thrice before they decide to demolish these statutes.	አብይ ተክለ ማርያም ደግሞ ይህ ወሬ ውሽት እንዲሆን ተመኝቷል፡፡	abiy tekle mariam also wishes this rumor to be false.
654	Destroying a figure of a man who had built the first railway in Ethiopia a century ago to construct rail lines is a complete sarcasm!	ከአራት አመት በፊት ስለእርሱ ረጅም መጣጥፍ ጽፌ ነበር፡፡	i had written a long article about him four years ago.
655	Abush Zekaryas relates an incident related to the recent controversy, which erupted in Italy after a small town east of Rome built a memorial to a Fascist military leader, General Rodolfo Graziani, using public funds.	ነገር ግን እጅግ ጥልቅ የዐሳብ ድህነት ያጠቃቸው የከተማችን ንድፍ ሰሪዎች መስመሩን ለመዘርጋት ከፍተኛ ዋጋ የሚሰጣቸውን ታላላቅ የታሪክ ምልክቶችን የሚዘክሩ ሁለት ሐውልቶች ለማፍረስ ወይም ቦታቸውን መቀየር አለብን ብለዋል?	however, our city's tree planters, who are deeply impoverished in thought, say that we have to destroy or change the location of the two monuments, which are a great historical symbol, that they give a high price to expand their line.
656	While some Italians built a memorial to a Fascist military leader, there is a rumor that Ethiopians are set to demolish the iconic statues of Menelik II and Abune Petros!	ጧት ጉዞ ላይ ሳለሁ፤ ፋና ሬዲዮ ይፈርሳሉ ተብሎ እየተወራ ያለው የአጼ ምኒልክ እና የአቡነ ጴጥሮስ ኅውልቶች የማህበራዊ ድረ-ገጾች የሚያናፍሱት ያልተጣራ አሉባልታ እንደሆነ ነገረን።	while i was on a morning journey, it was rumored that fana radio was broadcasting the undisclosed documents of atse minilik and abune petros that could shake the social media platforms.
657	What an irony - this is the difference and this is the progress!	ፋና በተጨማሪ እንዳወራው አዲስ አበባ መንገዶች ሊያሰራ ባአቀደው መንገድ፦	as fana additionally reported, the new roads to be constructed in addis ababa are on the way he paved.
658	And Aderegen, an anonymous group of bloggers, posted on their blog :	የአቡነ ጴጥሮስ ኅውልት ብቻ ተነስቶ፤ መንገዱ ከተጠናቀቀ በኋላ ተመልሶ እንደሚተከል	after abune petros was only canonized; he is expected to return after his path is cleared.
659	What we are asking is Why are these kinds of projects not preplanned?	የአጼ ምኒልክ ኅውልት ግን በምንም ምክንያት እንደማይነካ ነበር የነገረን።	he told us that the king's ceremony would not be cancelled for any reason.
660	Why are the statues and historical places of our forefathers who have contributed a lot for Ethiopia not given due emphasis during planning?	የአውሮፓ የጥንት ከተሞች ላይ ያሉ ኅውልቶችም ሆኑ የቅርስ ቦታዎች በመሰረተ ግንባታ ምክንያት ሲፈርሱ ሰምቼም አይቼም አላውቅም።	i have heard and seen that the heritage sites in the ancient cities of europe are being demolished due to construction, but i do not know.
661	Or is there a conspiracy against Ethiopia’s history?	ከዚህ በተቃራኒ Site Adaptation በመጠቀም ከቀድሞ ጎልተው እንዲታዩ ይደረጋሉ።	they will be made visible again by using site adaptation from this point on.
662	However, pro-government media, Fana Broadcasting Corporate, has a self contradictory story on their website denying the iconic statues will be demolished for rail lines construction! :	ምናልባት ህዝቡን ለማሳመን መንግስት ይህንንም እንደሌሎቹ ልምዶች (የምርጫ የስነ-ምግባር ህግ፣.	perhaps the government is also doing this to deceive the people like other tricks (election behavior law,.
663	The rail lines will be contracted without doing any damage to the statues.	አንድ አድርገን የተባሉ ህቡዕ ጦማሪያን ደግሞ አስተያየታቸውም እንዲህ አስፍረዋል፡፡	the opinion of a group of musicians called and adirgen is also expressed as follows:
664	However, as the Addis Ababa rail tunnel project passes through the iconic thoroughfare it will momentarily dig up the Abune Petros statue and it will not get anywhere near the statue of Menelik II.	እኛ እያልን ያለነው ሀገሪቱ ላይ የሚሰሩ ፕሮጀክቶች ለምን ቅድመ ጥናት ሲካሄድ የእምነትና የሐውልት ቦታዎች ፤ የአባቶቻችን ለቤተክርስቲያንም ሆነ ለኢትዮጵያ አሻራቸውን ያስቀመጡበት ቦታ ከግምት ውስጥ አይገባም ?	why don't the projects being carried out in our country consider the places of faith and heritage; places where our ancestors have left their mark for the church and ethiopia, before proceeding with their preliminary studies?
665	All the rumors revolving around this are baseless.	ወይስ ከበስተጀርባ ሌላ ነገር አለ……?	or is there something else besides the obvious...?
666	This is the second time in a year that the Ethiopian government has sparked controversy involving a statue.	መንግስት በሐውልቶች ምክንያት ከህዝቡ ከፍተኛ ተቃውሞ ሲገጥመው ይህ የመጀመሪያው አይደለም፡፡	the government is not the first to face significant opposition from the people due to its policies.
667	Kwame Nkrumah's statue, which was unveiled at the African Union (AU) headquarters, which was built with help of the Chinese government, has also sparked anger amongst Ethiopians as many Ethiopians feel that the country's former leader Haile Selassie also deserved recognition.	ከዚህ በፊት በቻይና መንግስት በተገነባው የአፍሪካ ህብረት አዳራሽ ቅፅር ግቢ ውስጥ የአፍሪካ አባት ተብለው የሚጠሩት ቀዳማዊ አጼ ኃይለ ሥላሴን በመተው ለጋናዊው ክዋሜ ንክሩማህ መሰራቱ ብዙዎችን እንዳስከፋ የሚታወስ ነው፡፡	it is well known that many were disappointed when the statue of emperor haile selassie, who is often referred to as the father of africa, was replaced by the statue of kwame nkrumah in the african union headquarters built by the chinese government.
668	It has been three months since Meles Zenawi, the late Ethiopian Prime Minister, was formally declared dead at the age of 57 after months of speculation as to his whereabouts.	የቀድሞው ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር መለስ ዜናዊ የት ይሆኑ ይሆን በሚለው ላይ ወራት የዘለቀው ግምት አቧርቶ በ57 ዓመታቸው ከዚህ ዓለም በሞት እንደተለዩ በመደበኛ መንገድ ከተገለጸ ወዲህ ሦስት ወራት ተቆጥረዋል፡፡	the former prime minister meles zenawi, who had been ill for some time, passed away at the age of 57, and it has been three months since his death was officially announced.
669	However, Meles Zenawi’s ghost shows no sign of loosening its grip over Ethiopians, through his portraits in the streets of Addis Ababa and almost all major cities, towns and rural villages.	ቢሆንም የመለስ ዜናዊ የሙት መንፈስ በአዲስ አበባ እና በሌሎችም ዋና ዋና ከተሞች እና የገጠር መንደሮች አውራ ጎዳናዎች ላይ በተሰቀሉ ምስሎቻቸው ኢትዮጵያውያንን አጥብቀው የያዙበት እጃቸው የመላላት አዝማሚያ አላሳየም፡፡	however, the spirit of the late news of meles in addis ababa and other major cities and rural towns on their erected monuments has not shown the ethiopians they have deeply touched their hands of healing.
670	As his legacy continues to be discussed in various international mainstream media, Ethiopians have been taking to social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to reflect on his legacy.	የመለስ ውርስ በዓለም መገናኛ ብዙኃን በመወራት ላይ ባለበት ጊዜ ኢትዮጵያውያን የመለስ ውርስ የሚባለው ጉዳይ ላይ የራሳቸውን ሐሳብ ሊያንፀባርቁ በፌስቡክ እና ትዊተር ላይ ብቅ ብለዋል፡፡	when meles's inheritance was being discussed on global media, ethiopians have taken to facebook and twitter to express their own opinions on the issue referred to as meles's inheritance.
671	Discussing unpleasant facts of Zenawi's legacy, Kirubel Teshome wonders why many Ethiopians fail to put Meles Zenawi’s legacy in context on the ground.	ክሩቤል ተሾመ የመለስን አስቀያሚ ውርስ ሲያወሳ ለምን ብዙ ኢትዮጵያውያን የመለስን ውርስ መሬት ላይ አውርደው ለመወያየት እንደከበዳቸው በአግራሞት ጠይቋል፡፡	cherubel asked why many ethiopians are burdened to dispute over meles's controversial legacy on the ground, while mourning the loss of meles.
672	Portrait of the late Meles Zenawi at Meskel Square in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.	የመለስ ዜናዊ ፎቶ በመስቀል አደባባይ፤ ፎቶ በእንዳልክ	melse zenawi's photo at meskel square; a photo in a rally.
673	Photo courtesy of Endalk, used with permission.	ኪሩቤል እንደሚለው:-	as kerubel says:-
674	I used to wonder about people who bitterly hate Genet Zewde while she was a minister of Education and love Meles, People who hate Bereket Simon and admire Meles, those who detest Ethiopian Television and have kind word for Meles, those who despise Ethiopian Telecom and adore Meles.	ገነት ዘውዴ የትምህርት ሚኒስቴር በነበሩ ጊዜ እርሳቸውን አምርረው እየጠሉ መለስ ዜናዊን የሚወዱ ሰዎች ይገርሙኝ ነበር፤ በረከት ስምኦንን እየጠሉ መለስን የሚያደንቁ፤ የኢትዮጵያ ቴሌቪዥንን እየተጠየፉ ለመለስ መልካም አንደበት የሚኖራቸው፤ የኢትዮጵያ ቴሌኮሙኒኬሽንን እየወቀሱ መለስን የሚያፈቅሩ፡፡	when genet zewde was the minister of education, people who loved meles zenawi were criticizing me for criticizing them; they were praising meles while cursing bereket simon; they were watching ethiopian television and wishing meles a good night; they were loving meles while hating ethiopian telecommunication.
675	Now that he is dead and we are told that he has been the thinker and doer of all the undertakings the country does the past two decades, can you at least have the decency to get of them and blame the man who is behind all these degenerations and denounce the legacy he built?	አሁን መለስ ሞተዋል፣ እናም ላለፉት ሁለት ዐሥርት ዓመታት የነገሮች ሁሉ አድራጊ እና ፈጣሪ እንደሆኑ ተነግሮናል፡፡	meles has now passed away, and we have been told that for the past two decades he has been the architect and creator of everything.
676	If he takes all the praise to himself, should he not be entitled to solely take all the blame as well?	ታዲያ እነዚህ ሰዎች ቢያንስ ይህንን ሁሉ የትውልድ ጥፋት ላስከተለው ሰው የሚሆን የጥፋት ውርስ ለመውቀስ የሚበቃ ጨዋነት አይኖራቸውም?	don't these people at least have the decency to acknowledge the legacy of destruction for the man who caused all this generational devastation?
677	On one of major unpleasant chapters in Zenawi's legacy, Abiye Teklemariam writes:	በሌላም እንዲሁ በሚያስቆጨው የመለስ ውርስ ላይ ዐብይ የሚከተለውን ጻፈ:-	abiy wrote the following on the legacy of meles that also frustrates him in the same way:
678	An Ethiopian court just convicted Bekele Garba, Olbana Lellisa and others of committing acts of terrorism.	የኢትዮጵያ ፍርድ ቤት በቀለ ገርባን፣ ኦልባና ሌሊሳን እና ሌሎችንም የሽብርተኛ ተግባር በመፈፀም ጥፋተኛ ናችሁ አላቸው፡፡	the ethiopian court told kale garba, olbana lelisa and others that they are guilty of committing terrorist acts.
679	This is the country we have, this is the country we have!	አለችን የምንላት አገራችን ይህች ናት፤ ያለችን አገር ይቺው ናት!	our country that we talk about is this one; this is the country we have!
680	I am sure many of the people who were singing the praises of our late PM immediately after his death doesn’t even know who these people are.	በርግጠኝነት ከቀድሞው ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር ሞት በኋላ መለስን በማሞገስ የሚያቀነቅኑት ሰዎች የታሰሩት ሰዎች እነማን እንደሆኑም ከነጭራሹ አያውቁም፡፡	people who are suspected of assassinating meles after the sudden death of the former prime minister do not even know who the arrested people are from the white terror.
681	However, some consider Meles Zenawi a visionary leader and believe that his legacy should be maintained. In a Facebook post, Jossy Romanat recounts a conversation he had about the legacy of Meles Zenawi with his friend: A Sunday conversation between Me and My Friend (MF).	ምንም እንኳን መለስ ዜናዊ ባለራዕይ ናቸው ቢባሉም እና ውርሳቸውም መቀጠል አለበት እየተባለ ቢሆንም፤ በፌስቡክ ጽሑፉ ጆሲ ራማናት ስለመለስ ውርስ ከጓደኛው ጋር የተነጋገረውን ይዘረዝራል:-	even if they say that meles zenawi was a visionary and his legacy needs to continue; on his facebook post, josey ramana discusses meles' legacy with his friend.
682	MF: Do you think PM.	የእሁድ ዕለት የኔና የጓደኛዬ ውይይት	sunday is the day of my and my friend's discussion.
683	Meles Zenawi was a great leader?	ጓደኛዬ:- መለስ ዜናዊ ታላቅ መሪ የነበሩ ይመስልሃል?	my friend:- does meles zenawi seem like a great leader to you?
684	ME: Yes indeed!	እኔ:- አዎ እርግጥ ነው!	i:- yes, it's true!
685	He was a great leader and probably the best Ethiopia has seen so far.	ታላቅ መሪ ብቻ ሳይሆን ምናልባት ኢትዮጵያ ያየችው ምርጡ መሪያችንም ነበሩ፡፡	not only a great leader, but perhaps the best leader ethiopia has ever seen.
686	However, this doesn’t mean he wasn’t irreplaceable, as you always believe. MF:- If you think PM.	ነገር ግን ይህ ማለት አንተ ብዙ ጊዜ እንደምታምነው የማይተኩ ናቸው ማለት አይደለም፡፡	however, this does not mean that they will not be affected as you often believe.
687	Meles was a great leader, do you support the idea of naming different institutions after his name?	ጓደኛዬ:- መለስ ታላቅ መሪ ናቸው ብለህ ካመንክ ብዙ ተቋማት በእርሳቸው ስም መሰየማቸውን ትደግፋለህ?	my friend:- if you believe that meles is a great leader, would you object to many institutions being named after him?
688	Like the renaissance dam” to be named Meles Zenawi dam” and his image to be featured on the 100 Birr bill ?	ለምሳሌ የሕዳሴው ግድብ” የመለስ ዜናዊ ግድብ” ቢባል እና ምስላቸው በመቶ ብር ኖት ላይ ቢሰፍር?	"for example, if the grand ethiopian renaissance dam is called ""meles zenawi's dam"" and their image is printed on a hundred birr note?"
689	ME: - There is no problem with naming things after a great leader at all.	እኔ: - ነገሮችን በታላቅ መሪ ስም መሰየም ምንም ችግር የለውም፡፡	i: - there is no problem in naming things after a great leader.
690	For example, I was happy to see that Mekelle University named its new camps in Quiha as Meles Zenawi Institute of Technology” I also heard the same story from Jigjiga University.	ለምሳሌ፣ መቐለ ዩንቨርስቲ የኲሓ ካምፓሱን ‹‹የመለስ ዜናዊ የቴክኖሎጂ ኢንስቲትዩት›› ጅጅጋ ዩንቨርስቲም ውስጥ ተመሳሳይ ታሪክ ሰምቻለሁ፡፡	"for example, i heard a similar story within jigjiga university when mekelle university named its campus ""meles zenawi institute of technology""."
691	And then, it seems many Universities, offices, towns and villages are busy naming whatever thing they have after Meles.	እናም፣ ብዙ ዩንቨርስቲዎቸ፣ ቢሮዎች፣ ከተሞችና መንደሮች ያላቸውን ነገር ሁሉ በመለስ እየተሰየሙ ነው፡፡	and, many universities, offices, cities and streets are being named after meles.
692	It sounds like they are in completion as to who wins the game” of the day well, and this could go beyond the limit.	ፉክክሩን” ማን ያሸንፋል እየተባባሉ ይመስላል እና ጉዳዩ ከዚህም በላይ ገደብ ሊያጣ ይችላል፡፡	"""it seems like they are arguing about who will clear the mess, and the issue could get even worse."""
693	For example, yesterday I heard that one of the oldest high schools in Tigray (which was named after one of the past Ethiopian heroes) has been changed to Meles Zenawi high school” – If this is true, it is ridiculous and disrespecting PM. Meles.	ለምሳሌ፣ ትላንትና እንደሰማሁት ከትግራይ ጥንታዊ ትምህርት ቤቶች አንዱ (በነገራችን ላይ በቀድሞ ጀግናችን ስም የተሰየመ ነበር) አሁን ‹‹መለስ ዜናዊ ከፍተኛ ሁለተኛ ደረጃ ት/ቤት›› ተብሏል፡፡	"for example, as i heard yesterday, one of the ancient tigray educational institutions (which was previously named after our hero in our case) is now called ""meles zenawi secondary school""."
694	Besides, don’t we have other local heroes who should be recognized at the local level, at least?	ይህ እውነት ከሆነ፣ በጣም አስቂኝ እና ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር መለስ የሚያዋርድ ነው የሚሆነው፡፡	if this is true, it is very funny and prime minister meles would be the one to step down.
695	Can’t we just give whatever we want for the new ones and keep the old ones as they are.	በዛ ላይ፣ በአካባቢ ደረጃ ሊከበሩ የሚገባቸው የአንድ አካባቢ ጀግኖች አይኖሩንም ማለት ነው?	does that mean there are no local heroes worthy of being honored at the local level?
696	Regarding the renaissance dam, well I believe it is appropriate to name the dam after Meles as it is believed to be one of his ambitious plans and had full energy and commitment for its accomplishment.	የሕዳሴውን ግድብ በተመለከተ፣ በመለስ ስም መሰየሙ ተገቢ ነው ብዬ አምናለሁ ምክንያቱም ግድቡ ከአስጎምጂ ዕቅዳቸው አንዱ በመሆኑና ለአፈፃፀሙም ቁርጠኝነት እና ሙሉ ኢነርጂ ነበራቸው፡፡	i believe it is appropriate to name the dam after meles, considering the grand ethiopian renaissance dam (gerd). the reason is that the dam was one of his ambitious projects, and he had the determination and full energy for its realization.
697	But then, I fear that this could be against Meles’s belief because when he decided to name the dam renaissance dam” he probably had a good reason for that.	ነገር ግን ይህም ራሱ ከመለስ እምነት ውጪ ይሆናል ብዬ እሰጋለሁ… ምክንያቱም እርሳቸው ‹‹የሕዳሴው ግድብ›› ብለው ሲሰይሙት በቂ ምክንያት ይኖራቸዋል ብዬ እገምታለሁ፡፡	"however, i suspect this will be outside of meles's faith... the reason i say this is because i believe there will be a sufficient reason for them to call it the ""grand ethiopian renaissance dam""."
698	But still completely in support of the idea of Meles Zenawi Dam”.	ነገር ግን አሁንም ‹‹መለስ ዜናዊ ግድብ›› ቢባል የሚለውን ሐሳብ እደግፈዋለሁ፡፡	"however, i will still support the idea called ""meles zenawi dam"" even now."
699	As to featuring Meles’s image on any of the Ethiopia banknotes/bills, I do not think it is a good idea.	ነገር ግን የመለስን ፎቶ በየብሩ ላይ ማተም የሚባለው ጥሩ ሐሳብ አይመስለኝም፡፡	however, i don't think it's a good idea to put meles's photo on every birr.
700	The Ethiopian ruling party, EPRDF, has had to endure an endless censure for using the name and pictures of Meles Zenawi to unite the country under his vision.	የገዢው ፓርቲ ኢሕአዴግ በመለስ ዜናዊ ራዕይ የኢትዮጵያ ሕዝብን አንድ ለማድረግ በስማቸው እና በምስላቸው መጠቀሙን መቀጠል አለበት፡፡	the ruling party eprdf, under the leadership of meles zenawi, must continue to use their name and symbol to unite the people of ethiopia.
701	However, some people feel that the party is abusing the late leader to the maximum.	ምንም እንኳን አንዳንድ የፓርቲ ሰዎች መለስን አላግባብ ፓርቲው እየተጠቀመባቸው እንደሆነ እየተሰማቸው ቢሆንም፡፡	even if some party members are heard saying they are using the party without accepting meles.
702	In an open memo, Kirubel Teshome asks the widow of Meles Zenawi to stop cheap adoration of her dead husband:	በግልጽ ማስታወሻው፣ ክሩቤል ተሾመ የሟች መለስ ዜናዊ ባለቤት ስለባለቤታቸው እያወሩ ያሉትን ርካሽ የፍቅር ወሬ እንዲያቆሙ ጠይቋል:-	in the clear announcement, cherubel, the owner of the famous mels news, asked them to stop the bad love rumors they are spreading about their owners.
703	Open memo to W/ro Azeb Mesfin: Can you please, please, please, tell the Addis Ababa .A city administration to stop violating the wish of the late PM. You openly told Ethiopians and the world that Meles was not a kind of person that indulges individual fame or cult.	- እባክዎ፣ እባክዎ፣ እባክዎ ለአዲስ አበባ አስተዳዳሪዎች እርስዎ መለስ የግል ዝና እና ሰብእና ግንባታ አይወዱም በማለት ለኢትዮጵያ ሕዝብ በግልጽ የተናገሩትን የመለስ ምኞት መጣስ እንዲያቆሙ ይንገሯቸው፡፡	please, please, please tell the addis ababa administrators that they should stop distorting meles's personal wish and public construction that he clearly expressed to the ethiopian people by saying that he does not like fame and wealth.
704	You revealed how he would have disliked to see all this images of him being a wall paper of the city.	ምስላቸው የከተማዋ የግድግዳ ሽፋን ሆኖ ማየት እንዴት እንደሚጠሉ ነግረውናል፡፡	we have told them how they like seeing the city's skyline in their pictures.
705	I am sure, by now, you may have noticed how the city administration have been relentless in advancing against his legacy by painting the town with pictures of the late PM.	እርግጠኛ ነኝ አሁን፣ የከተማዋ አስተዳደር ያለምንም እረፍት ከተማዋን በመለስ ምስል ከመለስ ውርስ በተቃራኒ እያጥለቀለቀው መሆኑን አስተውለዋል፡፡	i am sure now, the city administration is tirelessly transforming the city in the image of meles, beyond the legacy of meles.
706	I wonder why they dont wish to let him have peace at least on his death?	ቢያንስ ከሞታቸው በኋላ እንኳን እረፍት እንዲያደርጉ ለምን እንዳልፈቀዱላቸው ግራ ገብቶኛል፡፡	why did they not allow them to rest even after they died, it really bothers me.
707	It is also against his legacy to see cleaner and greener Addis.	አሁንም የፀዳችና አረንጓዴ አዲስ አበባን ማየት ውርሳቸው ነበር፡፡	even now, seeing the clean and beautiful addis ababa was their legacy.
708	Can you please call for the immediate collection of his images from the walls, fences and buildings of Addis?	ስለዚህ እባክዎ ባስቸኳይ ምስሎቻቸው ከከተማዋ ግድግዳዎች፣ አጥሮች እና ሕንፃዎች ላይ እንዲነሱ ያድርጉ፡፡	therefore, please arrange for their portraits to be erected on the city's squares, streets, and buildings.
709	It would be a favor that the people of Addis will not forget!	የአዲስ አበባ ሕዝቦች መቼም የማይዘነጉት ውለታ ይሆንልዎታል!	the people of addis ababa will always have an unshakeable commitment!
710	Since his death, the late prime minister has been praised for the economic growth Ethiopia has claimed to have recorded over the past two decades.	ሞታቸው ከተሰማ ጀምሮ፣ የቀድሞው ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር የኢትዮጵያ ኢኮኖሚ ላለፉት ሁለት ዐሥርት ዓመታት ላስመዘገበው የዕድገት ክብረወሰን ሲሞገሱ ከርመዋል፡፡	since the news of his death, the former prime minister of ethiopia has been praised for the economic growth he orchestrated over the past two decades.
711	By the same token, he has also been criticized for jailing political activists and journalists, using vaguely defined terrorism offenses.	በተመሳሳይም፣ የፖለቲካ አራማጆች እና ጋዜጠኞችንም አሻሚ ትርጉም ባለው የአሸባሪነት ወንጀል በማሰራቸውም ይወቀሳሉ፡፡	similarly, political activists and journalists will be punished for committing the crime of terrorism with a broad interpretation.
712	Ethiopians across the world are celebrating TeamEthiopia, their national Soccer team, who fought a hard draw against defending champions Zambia in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in Nelspruit, South Africa.	በመላው ዓለም ያሉ ኢትዮጵያውን የኢትዮጵያ ብሔራዊ እግር ኳስ ቡድን ከባለፈው ዓመት የ2012 የአፍሪካ አገራት ዋንጫ ሻምፒዮን ጋር በኔልስፕሩት፣ ደቡብአፍሪካ ያደረገውን ከባድ ግጥሚያ በድምቀት እያከበሩ ነው፡፡	people around the world are celebrating the great achievement of the ethiopian national football team in the 2012 african nations cup in nelspruit, south africa, which ethiopia had participated in last year.
713	Besides the beauty of the Ethiopian game and the composure the players showed after a long absence from the AFCON tournament, Ethiopian politics was at the centre of online discussion.	ከኢትዮጵያውያኑ ውብ አጨዋወት እና ከረዥም ጊዜ መጥፋት በኋላ በአፍሪካ ዋንጫ ከታየው ድንቅ የተጫዋቾች ችሎታ ባሻገር፣ የኢትዮጵያ ፖለቲካ ከኳሱ ጎንለጎን ማዕከላዊ የውይይት አጀንዳ ለመሆን በቅቶ ነበር፡፡	after the beautiful resistance of the ethiopians and the long-term decline, despite the astonishing prowess of the athletes seen in the african championship, ethiopian politics was far from becoming a central agenda for discussion.
714	Ethiopian fans in the stadium displayed various placards and flags representing different political interests.	በስታዲየሙ ጨዋታውን ለመመልከት የገቡት ኢትዮጵያውያን የተለያዩ ጽሑፎችን እና ባንዲራዎችን ሲያውለበልቡ ታይተዋል፡፡	the ethiopians who entered the stadium to watch the game have been seen waving various signs and banners.
715	Ethiopian Muslims protest the Ethiopian Government while supporting the Ethiopian Team in South Africa at The Cup of African Nations 2013.	የኢትዮጵያ ሙስሊሞች የኢትየጵያ ቡድንን በደቡብ አፍሪካው የ2013 የአፍሪካ አገራት ዋንጫ ላይ እየደገፉ የኢትዮጵያ መንግሥት ላይ ያላቸውን ተቃውሞ አስደምጠዋል፡፡	ethiopian muslims have expressed their protest against the ethiopian government by supporting the ethiopian team in the 2013 african nations championship in south africa.
716	From the Awolia School Support Page Facebook Page	ፎቶው የተገኘው ከአዎሊያ ትምህርት ቤት ደጋፊዎች የፌስቡክ ገጽ ነው፡፡	the photo was found on the facebook page of the supporters of awolia school.
717	In a bid to create a sense of deja vu for Ethiopians the blog Addis Rumble published a few historical photos from old AFCON tournaments in which Ethiopia had participated.	Addis Rumble የተሰኘ ድረገጽ ደግሞ በበኩሉ ከዚህ ቀደም ኢትዮጵያ የተሳተፈችባቸውን የአፍሪካ አገራት ዋንጫ ጫወታዎችን ለትዝታ ያክል ለጥፏቸዋል፡፡	the website called addis rumble has also compiled a history of the african nations cup matches that ethiopia has participated in.
718	In the pictorial post titled, The Ethiopian comeback it wrote:	‹የኢትዮጵያ መመለስ› የሚል ርዕስ በሰጡት በዚህ ጽሑፋቸው የሚከተለውን አስፍረዋል፡	"they have titled the following in this document as ""the return of ethiopia""."
719	This week Ethiopia is making a surprise comeback at the 2013 Cup of Nations in South Africa after knocking out neighboring rivals Sudan through an aggregate 5-5 draw in the final qualification round.	በዚህ ሳምንት፣ ኢትዮጵያ በድንገቴ ድል ጎረቤታችን ሱዳንን በደርሶ መልስ ጫወታ 5 ለ 5 በመርታት የመጨረሻውን ዙር አልፋ ለ2013 የአፍሪካ ዋንጫ ለመሳተፍ በቅታለች፡፡	this week, ethiopia has managed to reach the final round of the 2013 africa cup by defeating sudan 5 to 5 in a sudden victory in our home ground.
720	In the days after the qualification was secured in October last year, Addis seemed like a transformed city.	ለዋንጫ ጨዋታው ማለፏ ከተረጋገጠ ወዲህ ባሉት ቀናት፣ ከጥቅምት ወር ወዲህ አዲስ አበባ የተለወጠች ከተማ መስላ ሰንብታለች፡፡	since the announcement of the tournament, addis ababa has seemed like a transformed city in the days that followed, especially since october.
721	Previously you would hardly notice any football celebrations in the cityscape (other than of the usual English Premier League teams) but following the qualification most of the capital’s blue taxis and mini-buses – usually the best way of distilling public opinion – started displaying posters of the national team with a ‘Yes We Can’ text added.	ከዚህ በፊት (ከተለመደው የእንግሊዝ ፕሪሚየርሊግ ወግ በቀር) ብዙም የደመቀ የኳስ ወሬ የማይስተዋልባት ከተማ በዚሁ ወሬ ተጠምዳ ሰንብታለች… ብዙ ጊዜ የሕዝብ አስተያየት እንደሚንፀባርቅባቸው የሚታመኑት የታክሲ ውስጥ ጽሑፎች ሳይቀሩ… ‹አዎ እንችላለን› የሚል ጽሑፍ ለጥፈው ታይተዋል፡፡	"before this (except for the rumored english premier league), a city that doesn't usually hear much exciting football news was startled by this rumor... often, the writings inside taxis that are believed to reflect public opinion are not left out... a note saying ""yes, we can"" has been spotted."
722	The occasion was also packed with interesting Ethiopian political tidbits.	አጋጣሚው የተለየ የፖለቲካ ጣዕምም ተቋድሷል፡፡	the veteran has a unique political agenda.
723	Mohamed Ademo, a blogger based in New York wrote on Facebook about how different groups stood behind one team despite their variation on the political and cultural spectrum:	ሞሐመድ አዴሞ የተሰኘ፣ ኢትዮጵያዊ የኒውዮርክ ጦማሪ በፌስቡክ ገጹ ላይ የተለያየ የፖለቲካ አመለካከት ያላቸው ሰዎች ከነፖለቲካ ልዩነታቸው አንድ ቡድንን ለመደገፍ የቆሙበትን ሁኔታ እንደሚከተለው ገልጾታል፡	mohammed ademo, an ethiopian native new yorker, has explained on his facebook page the situation where people with different political views have come together to form a group despite their political differences.
724	Sport brings people together.	ስፖርት ሕዝቦችን አንድ ያደርጋቸዋል፡፡	sport brings people together.
725	The cheerful Oromo crowd in South Africa today is a good example of that.	የደስተኞቹ ኦሮሞዎች ስብስብ ዛሬ በደቡብ አፍሪካ ያንን የሚያስመሰክር ነው፡፡	the happy oromos gathering today in south africa is what testifies that.
726	In the states, rarely do we see both sides (Oromo and other Ethiopians) cheering for the same team.	በአሜሪካ ሁለቱ ወገኖች (ኦሮሞዎች እና ሌሎቹ ኢትዮጵያውያን) አንድ ቡድን ለመደገፍ የምንገናኝበት ዕድል በጣም ጠባብ ነው፡፡	in america, the chance of uniting the two groups (oromos and other ethiopians) into one is very slim.
727	We have separate sporting tournaments and federations.	የተለያዩ የስፖርት ግጥሚያዎች እና ፌዴሬሽን ነው ያለን፡፡	we have various sports federations and associations.
728	For Ethiopia's football fans in South Africa, the choice today was between OLF flag, the defacto Oromo flag, and the EPRDF (Ethiopia's ruling party) flag.	ዛሬ በደቡብ አፍሪካ ላሉ የኢትዮጵያ እግር ኳስ ደጋፊዎች ምርጫው በኦነግ ባንዲራ እና በአገልግሎት ላይ ባለው የኦሮሞ ባንዲራ መካከል ነበር፡፡	today, the election for ethiopian football fans in south africa was between the oromo flag on the onn band and the service flag.
729	As you have said so eloquently, whether the Oromo and non-Oromo fans of Team Ethiopia displayed different flags didn't matter. They both supported one team.	እናንተም ቀድማችሁ በግልጽ እንዳስመሰከራችሁት፣ ኦሮሞም ሆኑ የኦሮሞ ያልሆኑ የኢትዮጵያ ቡድን ደጋፊዎች የሚያውለወልቡት ባንዲራ ልዩነት ምንም ችግር የለውም፤ ምክንያቱም ሁሉም የሚደግፉት አንድ ቡድን ነበር፡፡	as you have clearly testified before, there is no problem for oromo and non-oromo supporters of the ethiopian team to wave the oromo flag; because what they all support was one team.
730	For far too long, at international sporting events and bazaars, a monolithic image of Ethiopia have been presented to the world.	ለረዥም ጊዜ፣ የዓለም አቀፍ የስፖርት እንቅስቃሴዎች፣ አንዲት ኢትየጵያን ለዓለም ሲያስተዋውቅ ነበር፡፡	for a long time, global sports events were introducing one ethiopian to the world.
731	An Ethiopia with 3000 years of history that is still a christian island, has one flag, and speaks only Amharic.	የ3000 ዓመት ታሪክ ያላት፣ የክርስትያን ደሴት፣ አንድ ባንዲራ ያላት እና አንድ አማርኛ የምትናገር ኢትዮጵያን፡፡	ethiopia, which has a 3000-year history, a christian stronghold, has one flag and speaks one language, amharic.
732	But in reality, Ethiopia is a truly diverse nation with divergent aspirations and historical experiences.	እውነታው ግን፣ ኢትዮጵያ የብዝኃ-ብሔሮች አገር በተለያዩ ታሪኮች እና ባሕሎች የተገነባች መሆኗ ነው፡፡	the truth is, ethiopia is a country of diverse tribes, enriched with various histories and cultures.
733	As a result, contending national sentiments (isms) have emerged.	በውጤቱም፣ ብሔራዊ ስሜቶች እየጎሉ መጥተዋል፡፡	as a result, national smiles are growing.
734	Under previous Ethiopian regimes, for example, the use of Afan Oromo in public spaces and government offices was banned.	ባለፉት የኢትዮጵያ መንግሥታዊ ሥርዐቶች ለምሳሌ፣ ኦሮምኛ መናገር በሕዝባዊ ስፍራዎች እና በመንግሥት ጽ/ቤቶች ውስጥ የተፈቀደ አልነበረም፡፡	in the past ethiopian imperial systems, for example, speaking oromo in public places and government offices was not allowed.
735	In EPRDF's Ethiopia, while linguistic and cultural rights are - at least in theory - respected, wearing or displaying an OLF flag amounts to an act of terrorism.	በኢሕአዴግ ኢትዮጵያ፣ የቋንቋና የባሕል መብቶች - ቢያንስ በኀልዮት ደረጃ ቢከበሩም የኦነግን ባንዲራ ማውለብለብና መልበስ በሽብርተኝነት ያስቀጣል፡፡	in eprdf's ethiopia, language and cultural rights - even if respected at least at a nominal level - will punish the act of waving and wearing the oromo liberation front's flag as terrorism.
736	What you saw today (the bitching and moaning about Oromo flag from those who still want to control the narrative of Ethiopia) is an extension of that false sense of unity.	ዛሬ ያያችሁት (ስለኦሮሞ ሕዝብ ያለውን ትርክት ለመቆጣጠር የሚፈልጉ ሰዎች ስድብ እና ዘለፋ) የመነጨው ከዚህ የሐሰት የአንድነት ቀኖና ነው፡፡	the one who started today (people who want to deny the truth about the oromo people with contempt and arrogance) is a false unity day.
737	I concur with you that, at the absence of national consensus, the way forward is to recognize our differences and respect people's rights to identify however they see fit.	ከናንተ ጋር የምስማማው፣ ልዩነታችንን በመቀበል እና ሕዝቦች ያመኑበትን በማክበር ወደፊት መቀጠል ስንችል ነው፡፡	what i agree with you is that we can move forward by accepting our differences and respecting what people believe in.
738	In the same vein, our Oromo activists should also stop pouncing on every chance to question the nationalism of those who are passionate football fans - and chose to look beyond politics.	በተመሳሳይ መንገድ፣ የኦሮሞ አራማጆቻችን ከፖለቲካ አጀንዳ አፈንግጠው ኳሱን ብቻ ለመመልከት የፈለጉትን የኳስ አፍቃሪዎች ስሜት በብሔር ነክ ጥያቄዎች ማስጨነቃችሁን ማቆም ይኖርባችኋል፡፡	in the same way, our oromo athletes, who have been pushed away from the political agenda, have the right to stop you from tarnishing the reputation of football lovers who just want to watch the game, by raising ethnic issues in the national network.
739	All the while, it's imperative to stay civil and use this opportune moment to ask: who is Ethiopian, what's the Ethiopian identity, does the EPRDF flag represent the aspirations of the diverse people of Ethiopia, does waving OLF flag automatically make one a secessionist, why do Oromos love the OLF flag, why are non-Oromo Ethiopians so scared of assertive Oromo nationalism etc.	ይህም ሆኖ ሳለ፣ እንደአንድ አስተዋይ ዜጋ የሚከተሉትን ጥያቄዎች መጠየቅ ተገቢ ይሆናል፡ - ማነው ኢትዮጵያዊ፣ የኢትዮጵያዊነት መለያ ምንድን ነው፣ የኢሕአዴግ ባንዴራ የኢትዮጵያዊ ብዝኃነትን ይወክላል፣ የኦነግን ባንዲራ ማውለብለብስ ገንጣይ ያሰኛል፣ ለምን ኦሮሞዎች የኦነግን ባንዲራ ይወዱታል፣ ለምን ኦሮሞ ያልሆኑ ኢትዮጵያውያን ኦሮሞነታቸውን የሚወዱ ኦሮሞዎችን ማየት ያስደነግጣቸዋል… ወዘተ፡፡	even so, it is appropriate for a wise member to ask the following questions - what is ethiopian, what is the identity of ethiopian, does the eprdf banner represent ethiopian diversity, will waving the olf flag cause resentment, why do oromos love the olf flag, why does seeing oromos who love their oromo identity upset non-oromo ethiopians... and so on.

741	On Twitter, under the hashtags of #TeamEthiopia and #Eritrea, there was also a great deal of discussion about sport and politics!	#TeamEthiopia እና #Eritria በሚሉ ሀሽታጎች ትዊተር ላይ ስፖርትና ፖለቲካ ላይ ያተኮሩ በርካታ ውይይቶች ተካሄደዋል፡፡	numerous discussions about sports and politics have been held on twitter under the hashtags #teamethiopia and #eritria.
742	Kweschn Media tweeted:	ክዌስችን ሚዲያ የተባለ ተጠቃሚ ያሰፈረውን ትዊት እንመልከት:-	let's look at the tweet that the user named media kweschin shared.
743	While #Zambia's fans waved only 1 flag, #Ethiopia's side had more than 2 flags.	የ #ዛምቢያ ደጋፊዎች አንድ ባንዲራ ብቻ ሲያውለበልቡ፣ የ#ኢትዮጵያ ደጋፊዎች ከሁለት በላይ ባንዲራዎችን አውለብልበዋል፡፡	while #zambia's supporters wave only one banner, #ethiopia's supporters have waved more than two banners.
744	But for Zerihun it would have been great for Eritreans if Eritrea was still a part of Ethiopia.	ፖለቲካ የተቀባ ኳስ - መፍትሔ ያልተሰጣቸው ጉዳዮች ነፀብራቅ፡፡	politics is a hot potato - unresolved issues are explosive.

750	What is it like to be a student at the Indigenous University of Venezuela ?	የቬንዙዌላ አገርበቀል ዩንቨርስቲ ተማሪ መሆን ምን ይመስላል?	what is it like to be a student at the university of venezuela?
751	Three students from the department of edu-communication recently took part in a workshop led by Rising Voices in order to learn how to take better digital photographs and how to upload and share them on the internet	ከትምህርታዊ ተግባቦት የወጡ ሦስት ተማሪዎች በእያደጉ ያሉ ድምፆች ትዕይንተ ሥራ ላይ ዲጂታል ፎቶዎችን እንዴት ማንሳት፣ በይነመረብ ላይ መስቀል እና ማጋራት እንደሚቻል ለመማር ተሳትፈው ነበር፡፡	three students who graduated from educational programs were eager to learn how to edit digital photos, post and share them on the internet.
752	These three students are part of an effort to showcase this unique university designed to provide an intercultural and experimental form of education to students from Venezuela's indigenous communities.	እነዚህ ሦስት ተማሪዎች፣ በዚህ ልዩ ዩንቨርስቲ ውስጥ ከቬንዙዌላ ማኅበረሰብ የተውጣጡ እና በይነባሕላዊ እና ተግባራዊ የትምህርት ዓይነቶችን እንዲለዋወጡ የሚደረገው ጥረት ማሳያ ናቸው፡፡	these three students, who have been selected from the venezuelan community in this special university, are a demonstration of the effort made to diversify the types of educational and practical experiences.
753	By accessing the university's satellite connection, which was provided by the government program called Infocentros , the students are able to access the internet to share images of activities, facilities, and the stunning nature that surrounds the 2,000-hectare campus located in the state of Bolívar.	በመንግሥታዊው ኢንፎሴንትሮስ የተሰኘ ፕሮግራም በተዘጋጀው የዩንቨርሲቲውን የሳተላይት ግንኙነት በመጠቀም ተማሪዎቹ እንቅስቃሴዎቻቸውን፣ ንብረቶቻቸውን እና አስደናቂ ውበት የተላበሰውን እና በቦሊቪያ ውስጥ 2,000 ሄክታር ላይ የተንጣለለውን ካምፓሳቸውን በበይነመበረብ አጋርተዋል፡፡	"the students have explored their campus, which is spread over 2,000 hectares in bolivia, using the satellite connectivity provided by the program called ""mengistawi infosenteros"", including their activities, their properties, and the stunning beauty."

766	Rosie Alves is a young Angolan blogger and cronista living in Luanda.	መኖሪያዋን ያደረገችው በአንጎላ ዋና ከተማ ሉዋንዳ ውስጥ ነው፡፡	she made her residence in luanda, the capital city of angola.
767	The crónica is a Portuguese writing form that is very suited to blogging - originally published in newspapers, they are tales, sometimes true and sometimes fictionalized, that convey a point or a conceit in a very short form. In her blog Sweet Cliché, Alves writes short tales, often about love and intimate encounters.	cronista” ማለት በፖርቱጋል ቋንቋ መጦመር የሚለውን ቃል ተስተካካይ ትርጉም የሚሰጥ ሲሆን - ፅሁፎቹ ባብዛኛ ጊዜ በጋዜጣ የሚታተሙ ታሪኮች አንዳንዴ እውነተኛ ተሪኮች ሌላ ጊዜ ደግሞ የፈጠራ ልብ ወለዶች ሲሆኑ ብዙውን ጊዜ የራስ ችሎታን በአጭሩ ያሳያሉ፡፡	"the term ""cronista"" is a portuguese word that often gives a corresponding translation, with his writings often published in newspapers - sometimes true stories, other times creations of imagination, often showcasing his talent in brief."
768	(Blogspot warns readers of the adult nature of her blog). Here's an excerpt from her most popular recent post Matei o meu amor - I killed my love:	Sweet Cliché በተሰኘው ጦማሯ አልቬስ አጫጫር ታሪኮችን የምትፅፍ ሲሆን፣ በአብዛኛው ስለፍቅር እና ስለፍቅር ጥብቅ ግንኙነቶች ትፅፋለች ( Bolgspot የፅሑፎቿ እንባቢዎች እድሜቸው ለፅሑፉ የሚመጥን ስለመሆኑ ያስጠነቅቃል)፡፡	sweet cliché, known for her pen name, writes captivating stories, mostly about love and deep sentiments of love. (her blogspot readers are intrigued by the maturity of her writing).
769	I like to write narrative crónicas - that are sometimes made up only of dialogue. They come very close to short stories.	ከዚህ በታች ሰሞኑን በጣም አነጋጋሪ የነበረው ፅሑፏ ቀርቧል፡፡	the very annoying sermon that was below here has been removed.
770	They are more committed to daily events, that is, banal, common events.	I killed my love” (ፍቅሬን ገደልኩት”):-	i killed my love.
771	I like to mix things up and explore new territory.	አንዱን ከአንዱ መደበላላቅ እና እዲስ ነገር መፍጠርም እወዳለሁ፡፡	i like to innovate and create something new.
772	GV: When did you start blogging?	GV: መጦመር መቼ ነበር የጀመርሽው ?	when did you start knitting?
773	Why do you write?	ለምን ትፅፊያለሽ?	why are you writing?
774	I decided to blog in 2010.	ለመጦመር የወሰንኩት በ2010 ነው፡፡	the one i prepared for planting is in 2010.
775	Writing calms me.	መፃፍ ያረጋጋኛል፡፡	the book fascinated me.
776	Every time I write, I feel that I am taking a load off of my shoulders.	ሁሌም በፃፍኩ ቁጥር ከትከሻዬ ላይ ሽክም እንዳወረድኩ ይሰማኛል፡፡	it always seems like i have fallen short of my expectations no matter how much i write.
777	And my tongue (lol).	ከምላሴም( ሳበሳ)፡፡	from my words (sabesa).
778	For me, it is the best therapy.	ለኔ መፃፍ ፈውስ ነው፡፡	writing is a medicine for me.
779	GV: You write quite a bit about love, intimacy, and sex.	GV: ፍቅር፣ የፍቅር እና ግብረ ስጋ ግንኝነት በተመለከተ ነው የምትፅፊው፡፡	love, it is about love and physical intimacy that you write.
780	How are these topics dealt with by Angolan society? Are they taboo?	እነዚህ ርዕሶች በአንጎላውያን ማህበረሰብ ዘንድ እንዴት ይታያሉ?	how are these dreams perceived in the angolan community?
781	Is there erotic literature in Angola?	ነውር አይደሉም?	is there a problem?
782	Angolan society is quite conservative in what relates to these themes.	በአንጎላ ልቅ ወሲብን የተመለከቱ ስነፅሁፎችስ አሉ?	are there literature that deeply looked into sex in amharic?
783	(This explains why, after Spain, Angola is the country that least visits my blog.) There are many taboos in Angola.	የአንጎላ ማህበረሰብ እኔ ስለማነሳቸው ሃሳቦች የሚይዙት አቋም ወግ አጥባቂ የሚባል አይነት ነው(ከስፔን በመቀጠል አንጎላ የኔን ጦማር በጥቂቱ ከሚመለከቱ አገሮች ተርታ መመደቧ ይህንን እውነት ያረጋግጣል) በአንጎላ ብዙ ነውር ነገሮች አሉ፡፡	the angolan community has a certain type of cautious stance about the ideas i raise (continuing from spain, the fact that angola is one of the few countries that slightly looks at my work will confirm this). there are many problems in angola.
784	In the old days, we could say that it was a question of conservatism.	ጊዜው ጥንት ቢሆን ኖሮ የወግ አጥባቂነት ጥያቄ ነው እንል ነበር፣ ነገር ግን በማህበረሰባችን ውሰጥ በርካታ ለውጦች በሚካሄዱበት በአሁኑ ወቅት ነውር ለሚባለው ነገር ምንም ቦታ የለኝም፡፡	if it were old times, i would say it is a matter of border security, but in our society where many changes are taking place, i have no place for what is called a problem at this time.
785	Now with all of the transformations ongoing in our society, I see no reason for taboos.	በአንጎላ ልቅ ወሲብን በተመለከተ የተፃፉ ስነፅሑፎችን አላውቅም(የተፃፉእና ለንባብ የበቁ) ለዚህ ሃሳብ ቅርብ የሆነ ያነበብኩት Paula Tavares ‘Ritos de Passagem’ (Rites of Passage) የተሰኛ ስራ ነው፡፡	i am not familiar with the deep sexual literature written in amharic (both written and suitable for reading). the closest thing to this idea that i have read is paula tavares 'ritos de passagem' (rites of passage), a profound work.
786	I don't know of any erotic literature in Angola (at least published and distributed).	ሰዎች የአንጎላ ማህበረሰብ ለእንደኔ አይነት ፅሁፎች ዝግጁ አይደልም ሲሉ በተደጋጋሚ እሰማለሁ፡፡	i often hear people say that the angolan community is not ready for my kind of writings.
787	The closest to this that I've read was the work of the poet Paula Tavares 'Ritos de Passagem' (Rites of Passage).	እውነት ነው አንጎላዊያን ለእንደኔ አይነት ፅሑፎ ዝግጁ አይደሉም፣ ነገሮች በሚሄዱበት የአካሄድ ፍጥነት ከሆነ ደግሞ መቼም ዝግጁ አይሆኑም.	it's true, the angolans are not ready for my type of writing, things will never be ready at the pace they are going.
788	I am used to hearing people say that Angolan society is not prepared for this kind of topic.	GV: ወጣትሴት ሆኖ በሉዋንዳ መኖር እንዴት እንደሆነ ትነግሪናለሽ?	as a young woman, how was it like living in rwanda?
789	That's true, it is not.	ቀላል ሆኖ አያውቅም፡፡	he doesn't know it's simple.
790	And at the rate things are going, it will never be...	እዚህ ከፍ ያለ ማግለል እና ለሴት ልጅ ክብር አለመስጠት አለ፡፡	there is a high level of discrimination and lack of respect for women here.
791	GV: Can you tell us what it is like to be a young woman in Luanda?	በመርህ ደረጃ ነፃ የወጣን ግን ማህበረሰቡ በዘልምድ ያስቀመጠልንን ሃለፊነት እንድንፈፅም የሚጠበቅብን ነፃ ያልወጣን ሴቶች ነን፡፡ GV: ስለልጅነት ትዝታሽ አጫውቺን?	we are free women who have not been released, but our community has kept us in a leadership position to fulfill our responsibilities. gv: can you tell us about your childhood story?
792	It hasn't been easy, here there is much discrimination and disrespect for women.	በአራት አመት እድሜዬ አባቴ ሚሰጠኝን የተረት መፅሐፎች ማንበብ በጣም እፈልግ ነበር፡፡	i used to really want to read the fairy tale books that my father gave me when i was four years old.
793	At four years old, I really wanted to read a storybook that my dad gave me, so he took me to a tutor who helped me read and write before I went to primary school.	አባቴ የቤት ውስጥ አስተማሪጋር ወስዶኝ ገና መጀመሪያ ደረጃ ትምህርት ቤት ከመግባቴ በፊት ማንበብና መፃፍ ቻልኩ፡፡ በጀርባዬ የደብተር ቦረርሳ ተሸክሜ ሁሌም አስተማሪዬ ጋር እመላለስ ነበር፣ እስካሁንም ድረስ እነዚህ የልጅነት ጣፍጭ የምንግዜም ትዝታዎቼ ናቸው፡፡	before i started school, my father hired a home tutor for me and i was able to read and write. always carrying a leather bag on my shoulder, i would always be with my tutor. these childhood memories are still vivid to this day.
794	I would go there every day, with my backpack on my back.	GV: በአንጎላ ያሉ የአንቺ ዘመን ትውልዶችን እንዴት ትገልጪያቸዋለሽ?	how will you explain your generation's times to those in the womb?
795	Even up until now, they were the most beautiful moments I've lived.	የኔ ዘመነኞች በታላቅ ለውጥ ውስጥ የሚኖሩ ናቸው፡፡	my relatives live in a big change.
796	GV: How would you describe your generation in Angola?	የሚችል ትውልድ ነው፣ህልም እና እምቅ ችሎታ ያላቸው፡፡	it is a capable generation, they have the ability to dream and persevere.
797	My generation is living through great changes.	መጥፎው ነገር እምቅ ችሎታ እንዳላቸው የተረዱት ጥቂቶች ናቸው፡፡	the ones who were saved are the few who had the ability to resist the evil thing.
798	It is a very able generation, full of dreamers and people with a lot of potential.	በሌላ በኩል የኔ ትውልድ እርስ በእርሱ ተወዳዳሪ ነው ፡፡	on the other hand, my generation loves each other.
799	Too bad few really know their own .	ግን በዙሪያችን ያሉ ስዎች በአንድ አላማ ስር ሲሰባሰቡ አናይም፡፡	but we don't see the problems around us when they gather under one goal.
800	On the other hand, we're very competitive, we cannot see those around us and come together for the same cause.	ጥቂቶች ብቻ ናቸው ‘ህብረት’ እና ‘በአንድ አላማ መትጋት’ የሚሉትን ቃላት ፍቺ የሚያውቁ፡፡	only children understand the words 'unity' and 'coming together for a common goal'.
801	Few know the meaning of the words union and solidarity.	ለመረጃ ቅርቦች ሆነን ሳለ ድርጊቶቻችን ግን በድንጋይ ዘመን እንደሚኖር ነው፡፡	our actions remain as if in the stone age while we are close to information.
802	We have more access to information, and even so we act as though we live in the stone age.	በአንጎላ የተለመደ አባባል አለ ወጣት ሆኖ በጭፈራ ቤት የማይጨፍር ወጣት አይደለም” የሚል፡፡	"""there is a saying that a young man who grew up in comfort will not be a young man who can withstand hardship."""
803	In Angola, there's the phrase a young person who does not party is not a young person. Youth today only wants to party. Without generalizing, because of course there are exceptions.	ወጣቶች ዛሬ ዛሬ መጨፈር ብቻ ነው የሚሹት ፣እርግጥ ነው ሁሉንም ወጣቶች በደፈናው በአንድ ማጠቃለሌ አይደለም፡፡	what the youth want today is not just to grow old, it's true that not all youth are in the same boat.
804	GV: Do you fit into a larger blogging scene in Angola?	GV: በአንጎላ ባሉ የጦማሪያን ምድብ ስር ራስሽን ትመድቢያለሽ?	will you hide yourself in the musicians' section at the back?
805	I think so.	የበይነመረብ ጓደኞች አሉኝ፡፡	i have internet friends.
806	I have online peers, the Angolan blogosphere grows by the day.	ገፁን እርስ በእርሳችን ለመደጋገፍ እንዲሁም ስራዎቻችንን ለበለጠ አንባቢያን ለማዳረስ እንጠቀምበታለን፡፡	we will use our page to share with each other and also to reach more readers with our works.
807	It is where we converse, trade ideas, and experiences.	ሃሳቦችን ልምዶችን የምንገበያይበት አይነተኛ መንገድ ነው፡፡	it is a fundamental way to exchange ideas and thoughts.
808	And not just there, I have peers in other countries around the world.	ከአንጎላ ብቻም ሳይሆን ተጨማሪ በተለያዩ አገሮች በመላው አለም በይነ መረብ ጓደኞችአሉኝ፡፡	i have followers on the internet not only from angola but also from various countries around the world.
809	What should I call him?- Call him love.	- አስተናጋጅ እባክህን ቢራ? - ምንን የለንም፡፡	- do you have beer, bartender? - we don't have any.
810	GV: Tell us about your writing process.	GV: ስለአፃፃፍ ሂደትሽ ንገሪን?	tell us about your writing process?
811	What are your greatest challenges?	ስትፅፊ የሚያጋጥምሽ ችግሮችም ምንድን ናቸው?	what are the problems that bother you when you write?
812	Generally, I pick up my mobile and I begin to write and in less than two hours, I finish. Sometimes I spend two weeks developing a text, and it even really frustrates me.	በአጠቃላይ የሞባይል ስልኬን አውጥቼ መፃፍ እጀምራለሁ፣ ከሁለት ስዓት በሚያንስ ጊዜ ውስጥ እጨርሳለሁ፡፡	i will start writing after turning off my mobile phone, i will finish within at least two hours.
813	One of my great challenges, if not the only, is to make the reader find himself/herself in what I write, and I can say that I have achieved that based on the feedback I receive.	አንዳንድ ጊዜ ደግሞ እንድ ፅሑፍ ለማቀናበር ሁለት ሳምንት የፈጅብኛል፣ ያኔ ትክት ነው የሚያደርገኝ፡፡ ብቸኛው ባይሆንም አንዱና ዋንኛው ችግሬ አንባቢዎቼ በፁሑፌ ውስጥ ራሳቸውን እንዲያገኙ ማድረጉ ላይ ነው፡፡	sometimes it takes me two weeks to prepare a manuscript, that's what frustrates me. even if it's not the main one, my primary and ultimate problem is making my readers find themselves in the text.
814	GV: Who are your readers, do you know?	GV: አንባቢዎችሽ ማን ማን እንደሆኑ ታውቂያለሽ?	do you know who your readers are?
815	How do people react to what you write?	ስለፅሑፎችስ ሰዎች ምን ይላሉ?	what do people say about the books?
816	I can say that many people read it.	ብዙ ሰዎች ፅሑፌን ያነባሉ ማለት እችላለሁ፡፡	i can say that many people will read my writing.
817	With that I mean: all ages groups, in the most diverse group of countries.	ይህንንም ስል በተለያዩ የአለማችን ክፍሎች በተለያዩ የእድሜ ክልል ውስጥ ያሉ ስዎችን ማለቴ ነው፡፡	what i mean by this is people of various ages living in different parts of our world.
818	It is strange, but according to the statistics, the country that most visits my blog is the US.	እንግዳ ነገር ነው በአለማችን ከሚገኙ ሰዎች በስታትስቲክሱ መሰረት በርካታ አንባቢዎቼ የሚገኙት በአሜሪካን ነው፡፡	it is a strange thing that according to our statistics, most of my readers are in america.
819	There are those who have told me they read via Google Translator.	በጉግል ትርጉም አማካኝነት በመጠቀም ፅሁፌን እንዳነበቡ የገለፁልኝም አሉ፡፡	they told me that they read my writing using google translate.
820	The majority congratulates me, gives me suggestions, and encourages me to carry on.	አብዛኞቹ አንባቢዎቼ በርትቼ እንድቀጥልና እንድጠነክር ማበረታቻ ሃሳብ ይሰጡኛል፡፡	most of my readers encourage me to continue and improve.

826	A public service announcement promoting condom use to combat the spread of HIV and other diseases in Kenya was recently pulled from the airwaves after the TV spot caused an uproar among the country's religious leaders.	በቅርቡ ለህዝብ አገልግሎት ይውል ዘንድ HIV እና ተዛማጅ በሽታዎችን ለመከላከል የተላለፈ የኮንዶም ማስታወቂያ የተለያዩ የሃይማኖት ተቋማትን ማስቆጣቱን ተከትሎ በመገናኛ ብዙሃን እንዳይተላለፍ ታገዷል፡፡	recently, various religious institutions have been criticized for preventing the broadcast of a condom advertisement aimed at combating hiv and related diseases, which was supposed to serve the public.
827	The advert, which shows a woman advising her married friend to use a condoms while engaging in an extramarital affair, was sponsored by Kenya's health ministry and foreign assistance agencies USAid and UKAid.	የኬኒያ የጤና ጥበቃ ሚኒስቴር ፒተር ቼሩቲች ለBBC ዜና አገልግሎት እንደገለፁት ማስታወቂያው የተሠራው ከባለ ትዳሮች መካከል 30 በመቶዎቹ ከትዳር ውጪ ሌሎች ተጨማሪ ግንኙነቶች ስላላቸው ነው ብለዋል፡፡	kenya's health minister peter cherutich told the bbc news service that the announcement was made because 30 percent of married people have additional relationships outside of their marriage.
828	The United Nations estimates about 1.6 million people out of the country's population of 41.6 million are living with HIV.	የተባበሩት መንግሥታት ድርጅት ግምት ከሆነ ደግሞ ኬኒያ ካላት 41. 6 ሚሌኒየን ሕዝብ መካከል 1.	if the united nations is a lottery, kenya also has 41.6 million people among the 1.
829	Christian and Muslim clergy condemned the advert as encouraging infidelity.	6 ሚሊየን ሕዝቦች HIV በደማቸው ውስጥ ይገኛል፡፡	6 million people have hiv in their blood.
830	Despite the advert being pulled from TV, it is still available on YouTube:	የክርስቲያን እና የእስልምና ሃይማኖት መሪዎች ግን ማስታወቂያው ከትዳር ውጪ መወስለትን ያበረታታል ሲሉ አውግዘውታል፡፡	christian and muslim religious leaders, however, have condemned the announcement as promoting extramarital affairs.
831	The Squared Factor blogger called the public service announcement spot on in a post titled Sikio la kufa halisikii Condom .	የኮንዶም ማስታወቂያው ከኬኒያ ቴሌቨዥን ማሰራጫ ጣቢያዎች ላይ መተላለፉ ቢቀርም በዩቲዩብ ግን አሁንም መመልከት ይቻላል፡	even if the condom advertisement has been removed from kenyan television stations, it can still be viewed on youtube.
832	The title, which loosely translates to a dying ear does not respond to a condom, is a play on the proverb a dying ear does not respond to medication:	Sikio la kufa halisikii Condom” በሚል ርዕስ ባቀረበው ጽሑፍ በጥሬ ትርጉሙ የሚሞት ጆሮ ለኮንዶም ምላሽ የለውም የሚል ሲሆን ተመሳሳይ ተርጉሙም የሚሞት ጆሮ መዳኃኒት ቢሰጠውም መሞቱ አይቀርም ” በማለት ማስታወቂያው እንዲመለስ ጠይቋል፡፡	"the phrase ""a dying ear doesn't hear a condom"" in the text implies that even if a dying ear is given a remedy, it won't stop dying. the announcement is asked to be revised."
833	I will not beat around this bush.	ዙሪያ ጥምጥም አልሽከረከርም፡፡	i didn't whisper around.
834	And I frown at those clamoring for the recent TV ad titled weka condom mpangoni , to be withdrawn from the airwaves.	መታቀብ አሊያም በአንድ መወሰን ካልተቻለ ለሚወዱት ሲሉ” ኮንዶም በአግባቡ መጠቀም ነው፡፡	"""if it is not possible to abstain, use a condom correctly for those who love,"" they say."
835	The message of this particular ad has unexpectedly tugged at the hem of society’s skirt: if you can’t abstain or commit to one partner, then use a condom if you care about your loved ones.	ለሚወዱት ሲሉ” የሚለው አባባል በዚህ አገባቡ ካልተፈለገ እርግዝና ከአባላዘር በሽታና እንዲሁም HIV እና HIVን ተከትለው ከሚመጡ ማኅበራዊ ችግሮች ቤተሰብን እና አጠቃላይ ማኅበረሰብን ማዳን የሚለውን ሐሳብ ይይዛል፡፡	"the phrase ""for those who want it"" in this context emphasizes the idea that if pregnancy is not desired, it can save the family and the community as a whole from problems such as abortion, sexually transmitted diseases, and social problems that follow hiv and hiv."
836	Caring in this context alluding to avoiding pre marital pregnancies, and contracting STI’s- among them HIV and the related adverse effects it has on the family and society at large.	ይህንን የቴሌቭዥን የኮንዶም ማስታወቂያ በተመለከተ #CondomMpangoni የሚል ሃሽ ታግ በመፍጠር ኬኒያውያን ማስታወቂያውን በመደገፍ እና በመቃወም ውይይታቸውን ወደ ቲውተር ይዘው መጥተዋል፡፡	kenyans have brought their discussion to twitter by supporting and criticizing this television condom advertisement, creating a hashtag called #condommpangoni.

853	Several opposition leaders were arrested in Djibouti, a small, but strategically important country in the Horn of Africa, after demonstrations which followed the February 22, 2013 general elections.	ትንሽ አገር ነገር ግን በአፍሪካ ቀንድ እጅግ በጣም ስትራቴጂክ አገር በሆነችው ጅቡቲ የየካቲት 15፣ 2005 አገር አቀፋዊ ምርጫን ተከትሎ በተደረገ የተቃውሞ ሰልፍ የተቃዋሚ ፓርቲ መሪዎች ታሰሩ፡፡	following the national election on february 15, 2005, in djibouti, a very strategic country located on the african horn, leaders of the opposition party were arrested after a protest was held.

863	James Schneider from Think Africa Press has always believed that the elections only gave the appearance of democracy:	የቲንክ አፍሪካ ፕሬስ ጸሐፊው ጀምስ ሽናይደር ሁሌም የምርጫው መኖር የዴሞክራሲ ማስመሰያ እንደሆነ ያምናል፡ - የፕሬዝዳንቱ የቅርብ ጊዜ ዳግም ምርጫ እ.	james schneider, the writer for tink africa press, always believes that the existence of elections is a testament to democracy - the recent re-election of the president.
864	His most recent re-election, in 2011, came after he changed the constitution to be allowed to run for a third time; the vote took place without election observers and Guelleh won practically unopposed after the opposition withdrew citing harassment and the unfair nature of the poll Guelleh’s illusion will have worked, at least in the short term: he will still have power but now with the veneer of a parliamentary opposition.	በ2011፣ ሕገ መንግሥቱ ለሦስተኛ ጊዜ አንድ ፕሬዝዳንት ዳግም እንዲመረጥ ፈቅዶ ከተቀየረ በኋላ የተደረገ ነው፡፡ ምርጫው የምርጫ ታዛቢዎች ባልተገኙበት ተደረገ እናም ጉሌህ ተቃዋሚ ፓርቲዎች እንግልት ደርሶብናል፣ ኢ-ፍትኃዊ ተግባራት ተፈፅመውብናል ብለው አቋርጠው በወጡበት ሁኔታ አሸነፈ፡፡	in 2011, after the constitution was amended to allow a president to be elected for a third term, an election was held. the election was conducted in the absence of election observers, and opposition parties have been genuinely defeated, claiming that e-government programs have been implemented, and they have withdrawn in the situation they have won.
865	Indeed, many people have much to gain from the electoral illusion.	የጉሌህ ማታለል ለአጭር ጊዜም ቢሆንም ተሳክቷል፡፡	even if it's for a short time, your patience has paid off.
866	But sadly, this group is unlikely to include most ordinary Djiboutians.	እርግጥ ነው በርካታ ሰዎች ከምርጫው ማታለል ተጠቃሚ ይሆናሉ፡፡	indeed, many people will benefit from abstaining from the election.
867	After all, you cannot improve freedom, development and wellbeing with illusions alone.	ነገር ግን እነዚህ ተጠቃሚዎች ተራውን የጅቡቲ ሕዝብ የሚያካትቱ አይደሉም፡፡	however, these users do not represent the general population of djibouti.

872	Djibouti may be a country few in the West know about, yet Western foreign policymakers have placed disproportionate emphasis upon the tiny nation as a strategic base for their operations in the Horn of Africa – particularly in combating piracy and the militant Islamists al-Shabaab in Somalia.	ጅቡቲ ምናልባት ጥቂቶች የሚያውቋት አገር ልትሆን ትችላለች፣ የምዕራቢያውያኑ የውጪ ፖሊሲ አውጪዎች ግን ከአገሪቷ እውቅናና የቆዳ ስፋት የተጋነነ ትኩረት በአፍሪካ ቀንድ የአክራሪ የእስልምና ጦር የሆነውን አልሻባብን እና የባሕር ላይ ወንበዴዎችን ለመዋጋ ዋንኛ ትኩረታቸው ናት፡፡	djibouti may be a country known for its tiny size, but western foreign policy makers prioritize it for its significant strategic location in the horn of africa and its proximity to the hotbeds of islamic militancy in the arabian peninsula and maritime pirates.
873	Perhaps understandably, considering the higher profile crises on its doorstep, the West has treated Djibouti as little more than a tool in its arsenal – as a military base, launch pad for drone strikes, or venue for regional diplomacy – rather than a situation worth addressing in its own right.	ምናልባትም በሚያግባባ መልኩ ጅቡቲ የራሷን የውስጥ ችግር ከመፍታቷ ይልቅ የምዕራቡ ዓለም ጥቅም ማስጠበቂያ መሳሪያ እና የአካባቢው ወታደራዊ ማዕከልነትና ዲፕሎማሲያዊ ጥቅም ማስጠበቂያ ብቻ ናት፡፡	perhaps, rather than solving its internal problems, djibouti is only a tool for serving the interests of the western world and a center for regional military and diplomatic interests.

882	To show my solidarity and support to the womanhood and their suffers and torments during the history mostly have done by men . as we have faced recently a stupid judges order to punish a person by putting on him the feminine customs, so it is one of the times that we should gather around each other and condemn this stupidity, brutality and inhumanity against the womanhood; the half of society as well as at least half of the human being on the earth.	በቅርቡ እንደተጋፈጥነው እውነታ ደደብ ዳኛ የሴቶችን ልብስ መልበስ እንደ ቅጣት አድርጎ ውሳኔ ሰጥቷል፤ ስለዚህ ይህ ወቅት ሁላችንም በአንድነት በመቆም ይህንን የደደቦች ኢሰብኣዊና ግማሽ የኅብረተሰብ አካላትና በመሬት ላይ የሚኖሩ ግማሽ ድርሻ ያላቸውን ሴቶች የሚያንቋሽሽ ተግባር የመቃወሚያ ወቅት ነው፡፡	as recently revealed, a judge in dedebit has issued a punishment requiring women to wear clothes; therefore, this is a time for all of us to stand together against this dehumanizing and half societal bodies' behavior that oppresses women who constitute half of the population on the land.
883	I am supporting womanhood by the at least I can do for them.	እኔ ማድረግ በምችለው ትንሹን ሴትነትን በመደገፍ እፈጽማለሁ፡፡	i will accomplish by supporting the little femininity that i can do.
884	The Facebook page of the Women's Association of Marivan also condemned the act and wrote :	የማሪቫን ሴቶች ማህበር በበኩሉ በፌስቡክ ገፁ ድርጊቱን አውግዞ ጽፏል፡	the marivan women's association has expanded its operations through its facebook page.
885	Security forces dragged a convicted Marvani’s man in the city.	የፀጥታ አካላት የማሪቫን ከተማ ፍርደኛ ግለሰብን ክብር አዋርደዋል፡፡	the security forces have dishonored the judge of mariva city.
886	They dressed him as a woman and wished by this act to humiliate him.	እንደሴት አልብሰው በድርጊቱ ክብሩን እንዲያጣ ተመኝተዋል፡፡	they wish him to lose his honor by dressing him like a woman.
887	The Women's Association of Marivan condemn this action and consider it an insult to women.	የማሪቫን ሴቶች ማኅበር ይህንን ድርጊት ይቃወማል፡፡	the marivan women's association will condemn this act.
888	Kurdish women protested against this act .	የኩርድሽ ሴቶች ተቃውመውታል፡፡	kurdish women have been persecuted.
889	Mohmmad Mostafai, an Iranian lawyer and human rights defender says	ኢራናዊው ጠበቃ እና የሰብኣዊ መብት ተሟጋች መሐመድ ሙስጠፋ እንዲህ ብሏል፡	the iranian guard and human rights violator, mohammed mustafa, said this.
890	Iran’s judiciary has no right to order such punishment which goes against human dignity.	የኢራን ሕግ አስፈፃሚ ይህንን የሰው ክብር የሚያዋርድ ድርጊት እንዲፈፅም የሚያስችል የሕግ ከለላ የለውም፡፡	iranian law does not allow the execution of this act that degrades human dignity.
891	Dressing convicts like women is not something you can find in the laws of the Islamic Republic.	እንደሴት መልበስን ቅጣት የሚያደርግ የኢስላሚክ ሪፖብሊክ ሕግ የለም፡	there is no islamic republic law that punishes for dressing like a woman.
892	History repeats itself	ታሪክ ራሱን ደገመ	history repeats itself.
893	More than three years ago, Iranian authorities attempted to use the same method of humiliation against a student activist, but failed.	ከሦስት ዓመታት በፊት የኢራን ባለሥልጣናት በተማሪ አራማጆች ላይ ተመሳሳይ የማዋረድ ሥራ ሊሠሩ ሞክረው ነበር፤ አልተሳካላቸውም እንጂ፡፡	three years ago, iranian authorities had planned to carry out a similar crackdown on student protesters; but they did not succeed.
894	Back then, Iranian authorities claimed that Majid Tavakoli dressed as a woman to escape after delivering a speech in Tehran on Student Day.	ያን ጊዜ የኢራን ባለሥልጣናት የጠየቁት ማጅድ ሳቫሊን ቴህራን ላይ ንግግር ካደረገ በኋላ በተማሪዎች ቀን እንደሴት እንዲለብስ ነበር፡፡	after that time, the iranian authorities asked majid savalin to speak in tehran after he made a speech on students' day, he was to dress as a woman.
895	However, human rights activists in Iran published a report from an eyewitness saying: All the pictures published by the state media are false and a clear use of immoral means against student and civil activists in Iran.”	‹‹በመንግሥት መገናኛ ብዙኃን የሚወጡ ማንኛውም ፎቶግራፎች ውሸት እና በተማሪዎች እና በኢራን የሚሠሩ በማኅበረሰብ አራማጆች ላይ የሚወጡ የተዛቡ የሞራል እሴት የሌላቸው ናቸው›› ብሏል፡፡	"""he said, 'any photographs released by the government media are false and those scattered moral assets that are produced by students and social activists in iran are unique.'"""
896	At the time, hundreds of Iranian men photographed themselves dressed as women in hijab to support Tavakoli.	በጊዜው በመቶ የሚቆጠሩ ኢራናውያን ወንዶች ቀሚስ ለብሰው ራሳቸውን ፎቶግራፍ በማንሳት ታቫኮሊን በመደገፍ ከጎኑ ቆመዋል፡፡	iranian men who number in the hundreds have stood up from their corner by wearing a dress, taking a photograph of themselves, and supporting tavakoli by posting it on time.
897	Today, October 26, was the day Saudi activists chose to protest against the driving ban on women in the Kingdom.	ዛሬ፣ ጥቅምት 16፣ 2006 ለሳኡዲ አራማጆች በኪንግደሙ ሴቶች መኪና እንዳይነዱ የተጣለባቸው ማዕቀብ ላይ ለማመጽ የመረጡት ቀን ነበር።	today, october 16, 2006, was the day chosen to protest the ban imposed on saudi women from driving cars in their kingdom.
898	As social networks were buzzing under increasing number of reports of women driving across the country, a brilliant a capella remake of Bob Marley's No Woman, No Cry spread at the speed of light, in a sound support of brave women challenging conservative sexist legislation and pseudo-scientific justification of them being prohibited to enjoy freedom of movement:	የማኅበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚዎች በአገሪቷ ውስጥ መኪና እየነዱ ስለታዩት ሴቶች ቁጥር መጨመር በስፋት እያወሩ ሳሉ፣ ተወዳጁ፣ የቦብ ማርሌይ ኖ ዉማን፣ ኖ ክራይ የተሰኘ ዜማ ሴቶችን በነጻነት የመንቀሳቀስ መብታቸውን ለመንፈግ የወጣ የወግ አጥባቂ ስርዓተ ፆታ ሕግን እና ሐሰተኛ የሳይንሳዊ ማብራሪያውን በሞገቱ ቆራጥ ሴቶች ድምፅ ድጋፍ ተቀይሮ በብርሃን ፍጥነት ሲሰራጭ ነበር፤	"social media users, while widely discussing the increasing number of women seen driving cars in the country, the popular bob marley song ""no woman, no cry"" came out as a satirical commentary criticizing the law and the false scientific narrative that suppresses women's freedom to drive, by cleverly altering the support for women's voices and blasting it at full speed."

929	Internet penetration in Ghana is about 14 percent and has been on the up and up for the last decade as more Ghanaians, especially young people, have hooked up to the web.	በጋና፣ የበይነመረብ ተዳራሽነት መጠን 14 በመቶ ገደማ ነው፤ በተጨማሪም ባለፉት ዐሥር ዓመታት በተለይም ወጣት ጋናውያን ከመረጃ መረብ ጋር መተዋወቃቸውን ተከትሎ እያደገ፣ እያደገ መጥቷል፡፡	in ghana, internet penetration is 14 percent; moreover, in the past decade, especially the youth's interaction with the information network has been increasing, it is increasing.
930	As a result, the number of Ghanaians on various social media platforms is also increasing rapidly, and some now see a need for a physical social media hub to facilitate the activities of the many people who use social media or want to learn about it.	በዚህም፣ ማኅበራዊ አውታር የሚጠቀሙ ሰዎች ቁጥር እየጨመረ በመምጣቱ አንዳንዶች የማኅበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚዎችና ስለምንነቱ መማር ለሚፈልጉትም ጭምር መሰባሰቢያ ስፍራ እንደሚያስፈልግ ታይቷቸዋል፡፡	in this regard, as the number of people using social media increases, some social media users and those interested in learning about its nature are seen to require a forum for discussion.
931	Enter Blogging Ghana, the country's largest organization of bloggers and social media enthusiasts with more than 100 members.	ጋናን ጡመራ (Blogging Ghana)ን ይመልከቱ፣ 100 አባላት ያክል ያሉት የአገሪቱ ጦማሪዎችና ማኅበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚዎች ትልቅ ስብስብ ነው፡፡	visit blogging ghana, it is a large group of the country's bloggers and social media users with over 100 members.
932	The group launched a campaign on January 20, 2014 to establish Ghana's first ever social media hub, explaining on their website:	ቡድኑ ጥር 12/2006 የጋናን የመጀመሪያውን የማኅበራዊ አውታር መሰባሰቢያ ቋት ለመመሥረት የሚያስችለውን ዘመቻ ድረገጹ ላይ በተደረገ ማብራሪያ ጀምሯል፡	the process of establishing the first social media platform of gana, which the team is capable of starting, has begun with an announcement made on the website on january 12, 2006.
933	A physical meeting place, a hub, will go a long way to provide a platform for the experienced bloggers in the organisation to train students and professionals on how to use blogging for creating #MoreStories and use social media to advance their agenda as citizens in Ghana.	በአካል መገናኛ ስፍራ፣ ቋት፣ ስብስቡ ውስጥ ያሉ ብዙ ልምድ ያላቸው ጦማሪዎች ተማሪዎችን እና ባለሙያዎችን ጡመራን ብዙ ትረካዎችን (#morestories) ለመፍጠር እንዴት መጠቀም እንደሚችሉ እና ማኅበራዊ አውታሮችን በመጠቀም እንደ ጋና ዜግነታቸው ተሳትፏቸውን ማበርከት እንዲችሉ ያስተምሯቸዋል፡፡	in physical meeting places, cafes, and gatherings, it teaches how participants with various skills can use their talents to create many stories (#morestories) and how they can use social media to promote their unique identities to students and professionals.
934	Africa on the Blog, a multi-author blog by people of African heritage, which is supported by Babs Saul and Sarah Arrow, explained the history of blogging in Ghana:	አፍሪካ በጦማር የተሰኘ ብዙ ደራሲዎችን የአቀፈ በባብስ ሳዉል እና ሳራ አሮው የሚደገፍ የአፍሪካ ቅርስ ሰዎች የጡመራን ታሪክ በጋና አብራርተዋል፡	africa, named after the tamarind, has embraced many writers, including bob saul and sarah arrow, who promote african heritage, and people have come together to tell the history of tamarind in a profound way.
935	The blogging and social media scene in Ghana has improved in the last five years.	ጡመራ እና ማኅበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚነት ባለፉት አምስት ዓመታት በጋና ዕድገት አሳይቷል፡፡	in the past five years, social media and internet usage have shown significant growth.
936	The West African country has seen the number of bloggers in the country grow from just a handful in 2005 to several hundreds this year.	በ2005 ከነበሯት በጣት የሚቆጠሩ ጦማሪዎች ዛሬ ላይ በርካታ መቶዎች የሚሆኑ ጦማሪዎችን ለማየት በቅታለች፡፡	since 2005, the number of musicians that could be counted on one hand has now grown to hundreds today.
937	This trend was facilitated by a bold step taken by a Swedish blogger who had moved to Ghana some five years ago.	ይህ ዕድገት አንድ ወደጋና የዛሬ አምስት ዓመት ገደማ የመጣ ስዊድናዊ በወሰደው ትልቅ ርምጃ ሊሳካ ችሏል፡፡	this growth could offset the major impact of the five-year recession that hit sweden, which was brought about by a downturn.
938	Kajsa Hallberg Adu who is now the Chair of Ghana’s biggest association of bloggers brought all the bloggers who were active online under one roof to discuss their passion.	ካጅሳ ሆልበርግ አዱ፣ በአሁኑ ሰዓት የጋና ትልቁ የጦማሪዎች ማኅበር ሊቀመንበር ሲሆን በወቅቱ በይነመረብ ላይ በንቃት ይሳተፉ የነበሩትን ጦማሪዎች ሰብስቦ በአንድ ጣሪያ ስር ስለሥራዎቻቸው እንዲወያዩ አስችሏቸዋል፡፡	kajsa holberg addu, currently the president of the largest association of artists, has managed to gather the artists who were scattered on the internet at the time and enabled them to discuss their work under one umbrella.
939	With time, this small group of internet users decided to introduce blogging and the use of social media tools to many other people who may be interested but just didn’t know how.	በጊዜ ሒደት፣ ይህ ትንሽ ቡድን ጡመራንና ማኅበራዊ አውታርን ባለማወቅ ዝም ያሉ ነገር ግን ቢያውቁ ኖሮ እነሱ እንደሚጠቀሙበት ሊጠቀሙበት የሚችሉ ሰዎችን ከማኅበራዊ አውታሮች ጋር ለማስተዋወቅ ወሰነ፡፡	in time, this small group unknowingly remained silent about the social media and the social network, but if they knew, they planned to inform people who could use it as they use it with social networks.
940	This selfish desire to spread such knowledge lead to what has today become the nation’s biggest blogging and social media event.	ይህ ዕውቀትን የማሰራጨት የግል ፍላጎት ዛሬ አገሪቱ በጡመራ እና ማኅበራዊ አውታር አጠቃቀም ለደረሰችበት ደረጃ አድርሷታል፡፡	the personal desire to acquire this knowledge today has elevated the country to the level it has reached in technology and social media usage.
941	Edward Amartey-Tagoe, the director of corporate services at Blogging Ghana, also recounted how things were half a decade ago:	ኤድዋርድ አማርቴ-ታጎ፣ በጋናን ጡመራ ውስጥ የኮርፖሬት አገልግሎቶች ዳይሬክተር - የዛሬ አምስት ዓመት ነገሮች እንዴት እንደነበሩ አስታውሰዋል፡	edward amarte-tago, corporate services director at ganan tumera, has reflected on how things have been for the past five years.
942	Some five years ago, there were only a handful of bloggers in Ghana, since then, bloggers and Internet enthusiasts have been organised under one umbrella body to build capacity, learn and share ideas from one another.	የዛሬ አምስት ዓመት ገደማ በጣት የሚቆጠሩ ጦማሪዎች ብቻ ነበሩ፤ ከዚያ ወዲህ ግን ጦማሪዎች እና የኢንተርኔት ወዳጆች በአንድ ጥላ ሥር ተደራጅተው አቅማቸውን ለመገንባት እና አንዱ ከሌላው ለመማርና ሐሳቦችን ለመለዋወጥ ችለዋል፡፡	five years ago, only musicians who could count on their fingers were there; but now, musicians and internet friends have teamed up to increase their potential, learn from each other, and exchange ideas.
943	Today, we are an influential organisation with a yearly event and awards ceremony who produce local content online on blogs and on various social media channels.	ዛሬ፣ ተፅዕኖ ፈጣሪ ስብስብ ከመሆናችንም ባሻገር በየዓመቱ ጥሩ አገራዊ ይዘት ያላቸውን ጦማሮች የሚጽፉትን የምንሸልምበት ደረጃ ላይ ደርሰናል፡፡	today, beyond being a disciplined creator, we have reached a level where we can compete with the good national assets that are written annually.
944	We want to share our skills and create #morestories!	ክኅሎታችንን በማጋራት ብዙ ትረካዎች እንዲፈጠሩ እንፈልጋለን፡፡	we want many solutions to be created by improving our capabilities.
945	ENews Ghana published the campaign on their website:	ኢኒውስ ጋና ስለዘመቻው በድረገጻቸው ላይ የሚከተለውን ጻፉ፡	they wrote the following about the journey on their website.
946	Bloggers in Ghana are creating Ghana’s first Social Media hub for bloggers and social media enthusiasts to meet, interact and share more local content from and we think it will make a great feature on GOOD.	የጋና ጦማሪዎች እና የማኅበራዊ አውታር ወዳጆች የሚገናኙበት የመጀመሪያውን ቋት በመመሥረት ሊገናኙ እና ሐሳቦቻቸውን ሊለዋወጡ ነው፤ ይህ ለዘለቄታዊ መልካም ዕድል ነው ብለን እናምናለን፡፡	the first platform where gena players and social media friends meet to interact and share their ideas is being established; we believe this is a good opportunity for sustainable development.
947	Social Media is growing in Ghana and we (Blogging Ghana) has over the past 5 years been a leader in Ghana.	የማኅበራዊ አውታር በጋና እያደገ ነው፡፡ እና እኛ (ጋናን ጡመራ) ላለፉት አምስት ዓመታት በጋና የጡመራ መሪዎች ሆነናል፡፡	the social network is growing in ghana. and we (ghana's pioneers) have been leaders in the ghanaian network for the past five years.
948	In 2012, with funding from USAID, UKAID, EU & DANIDA, we used social media to cover Ghana’s elections; raising awareness of the issues and empowering politicians and citizens.	ከUSAID፣ UKAID፣ EU እና DANIDA በተገኘ የገንዘብ ድጋፍ ማኅበራዊ አውታርን የጋናን ምርጫ ሽፋን ለመስጠት ተጠቅመንበታል፤ በተለያዩ ጉዳዮች ላይ ግንዛቤዎችን በማስጨበጥ እና ፖለቲከኞችን እና ዜጎችን በማጎልበትም ጭምር፡፡	with financial support from usaid, ukaid, eu and danida, we have used social media to disseminate information about the gana election; by posting comments on various issues and influencing politicians and citizens alike.
949	We also in 2013 organised Ghana’s first social media awards which was huge success.	አ. 2013 የጋናን የመጀመሪያውን የጋናን የጦማሪዎች ሽልማትንም በማዘጋጀት ትልቅ ስኬት ተቀናጅተናል፡፡	a. in 2013, we made a significant stride by organizing the first ganan musicians' award.
950	We want to do more and get more Ghanaians to use social media to tell their stories.	ብዙ መሥራት እና ብዙ ጋናውያን ወደማኅበራዊ አውታር በመውጣት ታሪካቸውን እንዲናገሩ እንፈልጋለን፡፡	we want many workers and many artists to join the social network to tell their story.

952	We have therefore launched a crowdfunding campaign to create a haven/hub with a co-blogging space to and create the much needed local content.	ለዚህም ከዜጎች ገንዘብ በመሰብሰብ የመገናኛ ስፍራ መመሥረት ለጋራ ጡመራ እና የአገር ውስጥ መረጃዎችን ለመጻፍ የሚያስችለንን ዘመቻ ጀምረናል፡፡	we have started an era that allows us to establish a communication center by collecting money from citizens, and to write domestic information for mutual benefit.

1021	Customizing: April Fools’ is for foreigners.	በ1997 የተደረገው የኢትዮጵያ ምርጫ በአወዛጋቢ ሁኔታ የጎዳና ላይ ነውጦች ተከስተውበት ነበር የተጠናቀቀው፡፡	the 1997 ethiopian election was held under contentious circumstances, with allegations of fraud.
1022	The disputed 2005 Ethiopian election ended in street protests, with 193 people killed and more that 30,000 people detained by security forces.	193 ሰዎች በመንግሥት ታጣቂዎች ሲገደሉ ከ30 ሺህ በላይ ሰዎች በፀጥታ ኃይሎች ለእስር ተዳርገው ነበር፡፡	193 people were killed by government forces and over 30,000 people were arrested by security forces.
1023	In 2010, the election ended in a landslide victory for the incumbent Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, taking 99.6 percent of parliamentary seats.	ተቃዋሚ ፓርቲዎች የምርጫውን ውጤት ውድቅ ያደረጉ ሲሆን አለም አቀፍ ታዛቢዎችም ምርጫው ዓለም አቀፋዊ መስፈርቶች በታች እንደነበር መስክረዋል፡፡	opposition parties have rejected the election results, while international observers have testified that the election was below international standards.
1024	The opposition rejected the results and international observers said the election fell short of international standards.	አ በ2000 ካስቀመጧቸው የሚሌኒየሙ የልማት ግቦች መካከል ኢትዮጵያ አንዱን ከግቡ ዓመት ቀድማ በክብረወሰን ታሳካለች፡	among the millennium development goals set in 2000, ethiopia has successfully achieved one a year ahead of schedule.
1025	Apparently, Ethiopia will meet one of its Millennium Development Goals - a set of development goals agreed upon at the United Nations' Millennium Summit in 2000 - in record time:	ኢትዮጵያ የንፁህ መጠጥ ውሃ አቅርቦትን ከምዕተ አመቱ ግብ ቀድማ እንደምታሳካ አንዳንድ ውስጥ አዋቂ ምንጮች ገለፁ #ETvDay (Photo Arsi/Ethiopia - 2013) pic.	ethiopia is expected to achieve its clean drinking water provision target earlier than the set year, according to some informed sources. #etvday (photo arsi/ethiopia - 2013) pic.

1027	Gulelle sub-city residents who couldn't get drinking water for the past 20 days said they were not affected because they had been given training on how to live without water.	#Etvday በጉለሌ ክፍለ ከተማ የሚገኙ ነዋሪዎች ከ20 ቀናት በላይ የመጠጥ ውሃ ማግኘት ባይችሉም፥ ልማታዊው መንግስታችን ያለ መጠጥ ውሃ እንዴት መኖር እንደሚቻል አስቀድሞ ስልጠና ስለሰጠን ተጎጂ አልሆንም ሲሉ ገለፁ።	residents in gulele sub-city, who have been unable to get drinking water for more than 20 days, expressed their frustration saying that our developmental government should have given us a heads-up on how to survive without drinking water.
1028	On the Crimea referendum, in which that region of Ukraine overwhelmingly voted to be annexed by Russia:	— Tewodros Belay (@tewodros_belay) April 1, 2014	i'm sorry, but you didn't provide an amharic sentence to translate.
1029	Some residents of Adama said that Russia’s annexation of Crimea won’t affect the Growth and Transformation plan of Ethiopia.	የዩክሬይን የዚያ አካባቢ ነዋሪዎች ወደራሽያ ለመቀጠል በትልቅ ድምፅ በወሰኑበት የክራይሜያን ሪፈረንደም ጉዳይ ደግሞ፡	the residents of that area in ukraine have also overwhelmingly voted to continue to russia in the crimean referendum.
1030	Mahlet categorized news into two types:	አንደኛው ዜና ነው፤ ሁለተኛው የኢቴቪ ዜና ነው፡፡	the first one is the news; the second one is etv news.

1035	In response to allegations by activists that today is #ETVday, ETV announced today is the only day of the year that it does not own. #April1 — Bon Bon (@BonayaBonso) April 1, 2014	ዛሬ የኢቴቪ ቀን ነው እያሉ ለሚያከብሩ ተሟጋቾች ኢቴቪ በሰጠው ምላሽ በዓመት ውስጥ የኢቴቪ ቀን ያልሆነው አፕሪል ዘ ፉል ብቻ እንደሆነ ገለፀ፡፡ #April1 — Bon Bon (@BonayaBonso) April 1, 2014	"etv announced that, according to the directive it gave to its viewers who say ""today is etv day"", the only day in the year that is not etv day is april fool's day. #april1 — bon bon (@bonayabonso) april 1, 2014"
