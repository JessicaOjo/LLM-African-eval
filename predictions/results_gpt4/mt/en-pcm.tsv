214	While the Plan has earned the endorsement of many state governments, it faces significant challenges.	Many state goment don endorse am, but e dey face some kind challenge.	while plenty state governments don support the plan, e still dey face serious wahala.
215	Deficient political leadership, popular misperceptions about its purpose, budgetary constraints aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a lack of personnel with the expertise to carry it out and widespread insecurity, are all hindering progress.	Political leadership wey o dey work well, perception about hin purpose wey no korrect, budget constraints wey increase bikos of COVID-19 pandemic,  experts wey no dey to do di work and insecurity wey dey evriwer, dey block di progress	no-good political leadership, people dey misunderstand wetin e suppose be, money wahala wey covid-19 pandemic cause, no enough people wey sabi how to do am and too much wahala, na im dey slow down progress.

219	It is animated by the hope that over a period of 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists will be persuaded to move their cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, where breedingg farms and other mechanised livestock management practices are to bolster the sectors productivity.	Di movement get hope say afta 10 years,herders wey dey waka up and down mainly go get mind to dey put dey put dia cattle inside ranch and reserve for public grazin, wia breedin farms and oda mechanised livestock management go support wetin di sector go produce	e dey gingered by hope say inside 10 years time, people wey dey waka about with dia cattle go gree move dem go ranches and public grazing reserves, where dem go fit breed more cows and other kain mechanised livestock management practices go help boost the sector productivity.

222	The federal government, which has committed to funding 80 per cent of the transformation proposals submitted by participating states, has taken preliminary steps toward putting the Plan into practice, including providing technical support to help states prepare for implementation, such as help with field surveys and site mapping.	Di Federal Goment wey get mind to drop moni wey go carry like 80 percent of di Transformation proposal wey di states wey dey involve submit, don dey take di first step to practice wetin dem plan, wey go include technical support wey go help dem state prepare to start work, tins like field survey and site mappin.	federal government wey don promise to fund 80 per cent of the transformation proposals wey states wey join submit, don start small-small steps to put the plan into action, including to give technical support to help states prepare for the work wey go happen, like help with field survey and site mapping.
223	Several states have reactivated earlier demarcated grazing reserves, opened offices and set up steering committees to administer the Plan.	Plenti state don dey reactivate grazin reserve wey dem demarcate, dey open office, dey kom set up steerin committee wey go dey manage di plan join.	plenti states don reactivate before-before demarcated grazing reserves, dem don open offices and set up steering committees to dey manage the plan.

As two years don comot for di 10-year plan wey dem do, dey neva build any ranch and dia obstacles plenti	but two years don enter inside the 10-year plan, dem never still build the first new ranch, and wahala plenty well well.
226	Opposition, partly among herders, predominantly from the Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers who resent the Plans benefits to pastoralists, hinders reform efforts.	opposition wey dey kom from di herders, though na from di Fulani pipo e plenti pass, e kom still dey among di farmers wey no want make pastolist dem enjoy di benefit of di plan sef, dey spoil di reform effort	opposition, small small from herders, wey mostly na fulani ethnic group, but also from farmers wey no like the benefits wey the plans dey give to pastoralists, na im dey slow down reform efforts.
227	Distrust is widespread in the Middle Belt, which has been the scene of violent disputes over land between herders and farmers, notwithstanding peacemaking and military efforts that since 2018 have reduced the bloodshed.

228	Federal and state budgets are pinched, partly due to the pandemics economic fallout, and the country lacks sufficient technical expertise for managing ranches and grazing reserves.	Shortage don dey federal and state goment budget, small part na bikos of di economy wey spoil bikos of di pandemic, and bikos di kontri no get technical experts wey know how dem take dey manage ranch and grazin reserve	federal and state budgets dey tight, part of am na because of the wahala wey dis pandemic bring for economy, and our country no get enough sabi people wey fit manage ranches and grazing reserves.
229	In many states, especially in the North-West, the proliferation of criminal gangs and other armed groups is cutting off access to grazing reserves and scaring away potential investors.	For many states, especially for North-West, di way wey criminal gang and group dem wey get arm dey grow dey spoil access to grazin reserves and e dey make pipo wey wan invest before no do am again	for plenty states, especially for north-west, the way wey criminal gangs and other people wey carry gun full everywhere dey stop people from reaching where dem dey keep animals for grazing and e dey fear people wey wan invest money.
230	Unless addressed, these and other problems could delay or even scuttle the Plan, leaving the country vulnerable to an escalation of herder-farmer conflict, which could degenerate into wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.	unless dey do somethin about am, dis kasala and oda ones fit delay or make e spoil di plan, wey go make di kontri dey helpless wen di fight between farmers and herders dey serious pass before own, wey fit kom turn fight between ethnic group, region and religion	if dem no address am, dis and oda wahala fit delay or even scatter the plan, leave the country open to more wahala of herder-farmer fight, wey fit turn to big ethnic, regional and religious violence.
231	Tackling these challenges requires a concerted effort by federal and state authorities, with help from donors and investors.	To tackle dis kasala,e go dey important make Federal and State authority join hand make effort, wit donors and investors help.	to face these wahala need join body work from federal and state authorities, with help from people wey dey give and investors.
232	First, Abuja and supportive state governments should provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispel misgivings and misperceptions about the Plan.	First, make Abuja and oda states wey dey support am provide political leadership wey strong pass before, make dey kom increase dia communication wit public, so dem go fit spoil pipo doubt and wrong understanding of di plan	first, abuja and state governments wey dey support suppose provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to clear doubt and wrong understanding about the plan.
233	These are especially prevalent among pastoralists, who will be asked to change a centuries-old nomadic lifestyle, and who legitimately doubt the Plans promises about available pasture.	Dis one dey common pass for pastoralists dia side, wey go ask dem make dem change dia nomadic lifestlye wey dey wit dia pipo for centuries, wey still get serious doubt say di plan promise about pasture na lie.	dem dey see dis kind thing wella for people wey dey rear cattle, wey dem go ask make dem change their way of life wey don tey, and wey dem get correct reason to doubt whether the plans promises about place to rear their cattle dey true.
234	But many farmers are fearful too, that they may lose land to livestock producers.	But many farmers dey fear say dem go lose dia land give pipo wey dey produce livestock.	but plenty farmers dey fear too, say dem fit lose dem land give people wey dey rear animals.
235	Many in the Middle Belt and southern states remain deeply suspicious of the Plans long-term goals, which they see as creating privileges for herders, and more broadly, the Fulani.	Many pipo for di middle Belt and oda states for di South still dey suspect di plan long-term goals, wey dem dey see as opportunity for herders and di Fulani people particularly	plenty people for middle belt and southern states still dey very suspicious about the long-term goals of the plans, wey dem see as way to create privileges for herders, and more broadly, the fulani.
236	With Abuja and other partners support, state governments must build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processing.	Wit di support from Abuja and oda partners, state goments go need find pipo wey go be expert, wey go know technical aspect of thins, especially pipo wey go dey manage di ranch and grazin reserve, dairy production and meat processin	with di support wey abuja and oda partners dey give, state governments suppose build sabi and technical ability, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processing.
237	Federal and state governments should also up budgetary commitments, hasten the release of funds and provide financial transparency to ensure accountability, working with donors and investors as necessary.	Make Federal and State goment sef increase dia budget for di plan, release di fund quick and make dey kom create financial transparency to make sure say evrithin dey accounted for, to dey work wit donors and investors wey necessary	federal and state government dem suppose increase budget commitments, quick quick release money and show clear financial matter to make sure say dem dey accountable, dem go work with people wey dey donate and investors as e dey necessary.
238	Addressing rural insecurity, curbing impunity and rehabilitating communities adversely affected by earlier violence in participating states are also vital.	E dey important sef to dey deal wit insecurities wey dey rural area, to dey curb impunity and to dey kom rehabilitate communities wey di fight affect seriously for di states wey dey participate.	address rural wahala, stop people wey dey do bad thing anyhow and help communities wey don suffer from before-before violence for states wey dey join, na im important pass.
239	Plus, authorities will need to consider climate changes likely impact and reach a decision about how the transhumant herders who cross into Nigeria seasonally should or should not benefit from the Plan.	Authorities go need consider weather change mata join, make dem decide if herders from oda kontris sometimes go benefit from di plan sef	plus, people wey dey control go need to think about how climate change fit affect things and make decision on how dem people wey dey move with their animals enter nigeria every season go fit or no fit gain from the plan.
240	While some of these steps will take time, the Plans proponents should focus on delivering concrete, visible results on a relatively short-term basis.	As some of dis step go take time,make di pipo wey dey plan am focus on how dem go fit bring result wey strong, wey pipo go fit see for small time	while some of these steps go take time, the people wey support the plan suppose focus on delivering concrete, visible results for short time.
241	Less than two years from now, the country will hold general elections.	less dan two years from now, di kontri go hold general election	no pass two years from now, dem go do general elections for we country.

474	As you may well be aware, the Bill to establish the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) has been one of the most viciously attacked and antagonised bill in the National Assembly in recent times.	As una fit don hear before, di Bill wey dem wan take establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) dey among di bill wey dem don tok NO to for inside National Assembly.	as you fit sabi, di bill to start di chartered institute of forensic and investigative professionals of nigeria (cifipn) na one of di bills wey don see serious attack and opposition for national assembly recently.
475	Sadly the attacks came from those who ought to be partners in progress in the fight against endemic corruption in Nigeria, but have rather designated themselves as enemies of the general good.	Di sad thing be say na pipo wey suppose dey put mouth for di fight against corrupt waka for inside Naija dey attack di bill, dem don turn to enemy for common ood.	e pain me say na those people wey suppose dey work with us to fight against corruption wey don full nigeria na dem come dey attack us, dem don choose to be enemy of better thing for everybody.
476	Good is good it has no substitute so also is bad.	Gud thing na gud thing, e no get substitute, na so bad thing sef be.	good na good, e no get substitute, na so e be for bad too.
477	No matter how long it takes, good always prevails over bad just as the superiority of light over darkness remain constant and unquestionable	No mata as e take long reach, good go always prevails ova bad just as di light superior ova darknes take dey constant and unquestionable	no matter how tey e take, good dey always win bad just as light dey always pass darkness, e no dey change and nobody fit question am.
478	It is indeed important for us to have a glimpse of how it all happened at the National Assembly.	e dey important say say make we see small of how e take happen for di National Assembly.	e really necessary for us to see small how everything take happen for national assembly.
479	Interestingly, The Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) was first passed into law by the 9th Senate on the 2nd day of March, 2021 having undergone the rigour of legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual at its 3rd Reading on the 2nd March, 2021 the bill was unanimously passed into law by the Nigeria Senate having deeply considered the urgent need for this noble legislation, of course this was not without series of thunder bolts from detractors who would not stop at any length to see that any legislation that would be helpful in assisting the Buhari-led administration to fight corruption does not see the light of the day but the senate stood firm and saw it through.	E dey interestin say, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na di 9th Senate first pass am into law  on di 2nd day of March, 2021 as e done pass di  legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual for di 3rd Reading on di 2nd March, 2021 senate dem pass di Bill  into law  wit one voice when dem don consider di urgent need  for di noble legislation, of kos no be sauy e apun without plenty  thunder bolts from detractors  wey no go stop at any lenght to see say any legislation wey go help di administration wey Buhari lead to fight corruption no see see light of day but senate stand welwel and dem see am through.	e dey interesting say, the chartered institute of forensic and investigative professionals of nigeria (est) bill 2021 (cifipn) na im dem first pass as law by the 9th senate on top the 2nd day of march, 2021 after e don pass through the wahala of legislative processes of 1st reading, 2nd reading and e come finally happen for the 3rd reading on the 2nd march, 2021.
480	It is very important for the public to know that (CIFIPN) is not just a noble body but a novel one in Nigeria that is targeted at bridging the gap that has long been existing in the forensics space.	E dey very important for make public know say (CIFIPN) no be just any noble bodi but a new one for Naija wey dem target say make e bridge di gap wey don dey for long for di forensics space.	e dey very important make people sabi say (cifipn) no be just better group, e be like new one for nigeria wey dey aim to cover the space wey don dey for forensics area since tey tey.
481	Today, the journey to having a standard body that would regulate the practice of forensics in Nigeria is at its peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge the few anti-government bodies that would want to sabotage this step.	Today, di waka to get one standard bodi wey go dey regulate di practice of forensics for Naija for im peak and make Naija pipo rise make dem challenge di few anti-goment bodi wey fit intend to sabotage dis step.	today, di waka to get beta bodi wey go dey control how dem dey do forensics for naija don reach top level and naija people must stand up to challenge di few anti-government bodi wey wan spoil dis move.
482	The passage of this Bill by the National Assembly, no doubt, is a clear demonstration of its patriotic zeal and the need to further strengthen all national efforts geared towards the fight against corruption, which has hindered development in every aspect of our national lives. 	Dis bill wey National Assembly don pass, show say clearly dem demonstrate say dem dey patriotic and di need to strengthen national efforts against corruption, wey don stand dey block development for evri aspect of awa national live.	di way wey national assembly pass dis bill, e no get doubt, na clear show say dem love di country well well and dem wan make all di national effort wey dem dey put to fight corruption strong pass as e dey, because na corruption dey slow down development for every side of we national life.
483	This legislative bold step, taken by the two Chambers of the National Assembly, is quite historic and symbolic, coming at a time that Nigeria is in dire need of legislation(s)	Dis beta step for inside legislation , wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey historic and symbolic, e dey happen at a time wey Nigeria dey need legislation welwel.	dis strong waka wey dem don take, wey de two chambers of national assembly do, na something wey history go remember, e dey very symbolic, e come for time wey nigeria need law(s) well well.
484	that will give more bite to its anti-corruption drive in view of the raising spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across the globe.	dat one go give beta way for im anti-corruption drive as di spate of criminal and corrupt waka don rise across di globe.	dat one go give more power to dem anti-corruption fight, as dem dey see dey increase of bad and corrupt way wey people dey behave, all over world.
485	As we all know, crime generally, has assumed a new dimension, due to advancement in science and technology in the 21st Century. 	As we all sabi, crime don enter anoda level as science and technology don improve for 21st century.	as all of us sabi, crime, generally, don get new way, because of how science and technology don improve for this 21st century.
486	Therefore, the passage of this Bill is apt and timely and it has shown clearly that we have flexible and responsive Legislature that is in tune and in touch with emerging global realities and ever-ready to enact legislations that will meet the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians. 	Therefore, as dem pass di bill dey gud and e apun for beta time, plus e don show clearly say we get flexible and responive legislature wey sabi di thing wey dey apun for di world, and dem dey redi to do legislation wey go meet wetin Nigeria pipo dey talk.	so, di pass of dis bill na correct and e dey timely and e don show clear clear say we get flexible and responsive legislature wey dey in line and in touch with di new new global realities and e dey always ready to make laws wey go meet di desires and hopes of nigerians.
487	It is apposite to also state that the journey, which culminated into the passage of this Bill, began in the 8th National Assembly whereby, our Bill was sponsored by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, the current President of Senate when he was a Senate Leader, because of its strategic importance to the anti-corruption drive of this administration. 	Make we also tok say di journey wey dey for inside as dem take pass di bill make e for turn to law, don start since di 8th National Assembly, wia Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan Ph.D, CON wey be current Senate President sponsor awa bill, when he be senate Leader, bikos e dey important to di anti corruption waka of dis admiistration.	e good make we talk am say na dis waka wey end for dis bill to pass, e start for 8th national assembly, na dat time our bill get sponsor from oga senator ahmad ibrahim lawan, ph.d, con, wey be current president of senate when e be senate leader, because of how e important reach for fight against corruption.
488	For the benefit of hindsight, when our Bill was introduced in the two Chambers during the 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearings were conducted by the relevant Committees of the respective Chambers. 	For beta understandin, when we be introduce awa bill for inside di two chamber durin di 8th Assembly, dem do public hearin wey carry evribodi along for inside di chamber.	for di benefit of afta-thought, wen our bill bin enta for di two chambers during di 8th national assembly, dem do public hearing wey everybody join body inside by di relevant committees for di different chambers.
489	Thereafter and in spite of opposition from stakeholders who were in the minority, led by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), the National Assembly passed the Bill, in view of its significance and the part it will play in the fight against corruption.  	Thereafter, and ontop say minority pipo wey be stakeholder oppose am, na Institute of Chatered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) lead dem, di National Assembly pass di bill, with view of how e take get significance and di part wey go play for di fight against corruption.	after everything, even with the wahala from people wey no plenty wey dey against am, wey na the institute of chartered accountants of nigeria (ican) na im lead them, the national assembly come pass the bill, because of how e important and the role wey e go play for fight against corruption.
490	Afterward, the Bill was forwarded to Mr President for Presidential Assent, which was not given before the Dissolution of the 8th National Assembly in June, 2019. 	Afterward, dem forward di bill give oga Presido, make e for put hand, but e neva put hand before dem scatter di 8th Assembly for inside June 2019.	after, dem send di bill go meet oga presido make e sign am, but e no sign am before dem scatter di 8th national assembly for june, 2019.
491	It is on the strength of this, that the Bill was re-introduced in this 9th National Assembly and this time around, it was sponsored by Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, the current Leader of the Senate, in view of the importance attached to it.	Na on dis stregth dem take bring di bill abck for di 9th National Assembly, na Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, di current Leader for di Senate, in view of as e take dey important.	na based on dis mata, na im dem bring dis bill come back for dis 9th national assembly, and dis time around, na distinguished senator abdullahi a. yahaya, wey be the current leader of the senate, na im sponsor am, because of the importance wey dem attach to am.
492	We are constrained to make this clarification in order to clear the air on the cheap propaganda being propelled by our detractors that our Bill was rejected by the 8th National Assembly. 	We dey pushed to make dis clarification in order to clear di air on di cheap cheap propaganda wey pipo wey dey distract us dey tok say di 8th Assembly don reject awa bill.	we dey forced to make dis explanation so dat we fit clear di air about di cheap talk wey our enemies dey spread say our bill no pass for di 8th national assembly.
493	Also worthy of mention is the fact that our Bill has being mistaken for similar Bills, which were recently introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives Chambers. 	 Also we suppose mention di fact say dem don mistake awa bill with abother bill dem wey dey similar wey dem just introduce for both di senate and House of Represntative Chambers.	e good make we talk am say dem don dey confuse our bill with other bills wey dem just bring come for senate and house of representatives chambers.
494	These Bills, upon our close scrutiny, we discovered that they are merely duplications of the intents and purports of our Bill. 	Dis bill dem, as we don scrutize dem with close eye, we discover say dem just copy awa intention and di thing wey awa bill stand for.	these bills, as we take time look am well well, we come find out say na just copy copy dem be of wetin we plan for our own bill.
495	It must be stressed that none of these Bills were introduced in the 8th National Assembly, other than our Bill. 	We suppose draw hear tok am say dem no introduce any of di bills dem for inside 8th Assembly, na only awa bill.	e dey very important make we talk say none of these bills dem show face for the 8th national assembly, na only our own bill.
496	As such, we are the first to ever come up with a Bill of this magnitude,(Forensic) 	As such, na we be di first to carry bill wey big reach like dis (Forensic)	na so, na we first ever reason to bring out bill of this kind size, (forensic)
497	having seen the urgent need to establish such great Institute.  	As we don see say e dey very urgent to establish dat kind great Institute.	as i don see the urgent need to start dis kind big institute.
498	The decision to establish the Institute was taken after a painstaking study of how the Institutes operate in other jurisdictions and how well they have helped in crime detection, investigation and prosecution.   	Dem take di decision wey dem take establish di Institute afta dem study how di Institute dey take operate for other jurisdiction and how dem don take help crime detection, investigation and prosecution.	dem take decision to start the institute afta dem don study well-well how the institutes dey work for other areas and how dem don help wella for crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
499	It is instructive to note that our Institute has been in existence since 2009. 	Na part of instruction make dem for know say awa Institute don dey since 2009.	e good make you sabi say our institute don dey since 2009.
500	And over the years, we have trained professionals in the field of forensic science and technology, targeted at inculcating the requisite skills and acumen in the pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:	And over di years, And over di years, we don train professionala to sabi forensic science technology, targeted at inculcatin di requisite skil dem for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:	and as years dey pass, we don train professionals for inside forensic science and technology area, wey we target to put correct skills and sense for inside dem head for the practical areas of forensic investigation and management, na im be say:

502	You will agree with me that in today's world, the conventional ways of investigating crimes, with a view to fighting it has become obsolete.

515	It is also pertinent to reiterate that forensic science is a very wide and all-encompassing field, which requires effective and efficient regulation for the attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standards.

Accordingly, you go agree say awa Institute don bring unique concept enter crime detection and investigation wey follow international best practices.	na so, you go gree with me say our institute dey bring come, one kind unique way of finding crime and dey investigate am, wey follow international best practices.
518	This concept is far beyond the reasoning of those whose myopic view about the purports of our Bill have beclouded their senses of reasoning, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, which is outside their jurisdiction and scope of operations.	Di concept pass as myopic pipo dey take thingk about awa bill don cover dem sense of thingkin, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, wey don pass dem jurisdiction and scope of operation.	this kind wahala pass the sense of those wey their short-sighted view about wetin our bill mean don blind their sense of reasoning, because of their narrow mind and too much desire to control system wey no dey their power or area of work.
519	On a lighter note, I wish to draw the attention of everyone to the funny scenario that is playing out now, and as a matter of fact, it should be a source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians. 	 On a lighter note, I wan draw di attention of evrione to di funny scenario dat is playin out now, and as a matter of fact, e suppose be a source of concern for all beta Naija pipo.	for small play play matter, i wan make everybody eye reach this funny yawa wey dey happen now, and true true, e suppose be something wey go worry every correct naija person.
520	When the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill was introduced in the 8th National Assembly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), came out vehemently to oppose its passage because according to them, it is an unnecessary duplication of functions already undertaken by their Institute.	Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), kom out wit anger to oppose di passage bikos according to dem, na unnecessary duplication of function wey dem Institute don dey do.	wen dem bring di chartered institute of forensic and investigative professionals of nigeria bill come di 8th national assembly, na so di institute of chartered accountants of nigeria (ican), come out strong strong to oppose am because according to dem, na unnecessary duplication of work wey dem don dey do already.
521	However, upon the re-introduction of our Bill in this 9th National Assembly, and having seen the overwhelming and accelerated legislative supports, our Bill has received from the two Chambers, ICAN has now realized that forensic science is a unique field of practice, and as we speak, they have introduced a similar Bill that is currently before the House of Representatives, having failed woefully in their attempts to stop the passage of our Bill.	However, as dem don take introduce awa bill again for dis 9th National Assembly, and as we don see di overwhelmin and accelerated legislative support wey di two Chambers don give awa bill, ICAn don realize say forensic science na uniques field of practice, and as we dey talk, dem don bring similar Bill kom meet di House of Representative, as dem don fail wofully for dem attempt to stop di passage of dis awa bill.	however, as we don put our bill again for dis 9th national assembly, and as we don see the plenty and quick legislative support wey our bill don get from the two chambers, ican don see say forensic science na special area of practice, and as we dey talk so, dem don bring similar bill wey dey cu
522	One may ask, what has changed between now and the past, where ICAN holds the view that there shouldn't be any Institute other than theirs to regulate the practice of forensic science?	One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN get di view say make any oda Institute no dey regulate di practices of forensic science?	person fit ask, wetin don change from before till now, where ican dey believe say no suppose get any other institute apart from their own to control how dem dey practice forensic science?
523	your answer is as good as mine.	Your answer na di same thing with my own.	your answer na the same as my own.
524	I wish to also inform you that the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), is not left out of this funny theatrical episode.	I for also like inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), also dey part of dis di episode.	i wan make you know sey association of national accountants of nigeria (anan), no dey left out for dis funny drama episode.
525	Just like their ICAN counterpart, they have also introduced a Bill in the House of Representatives with the nomenclature the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, which was initiated and being promoted by ANAN.	 which was initiated and being promoted by ANAN. Just as dem ICAN counterpart, dey sef don introduce one bill for inside House of Representative wey di same structure with di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey be na ANAN initiate am, and na dem promote am.	just like dem ican people, dem don also carry bill enter house of representatives with the name wey be the chartered institute of forensic and certified fraud examiners of nigeria bill, wey na anan start am and dey push am.
526	I decided to bring out all these facts so that Nigerians and even the international communities will understand the extent to which some people can go in order to achieve their aims.	I decide say make I tok all di fact dem make Nigeria pipo and even international community for understand di extent to which some pipo fit go say make dem for achieve dem aim.	i don decide to bring out all these tori so that nigerians and even people wey dey international communities go understand how far some people fit go just to achieve wetin dem want.
527	However, we are not perturbed by these developments because we believe in the credibility and ability of the National Assembly and indeed the Presidency to do what is right and not to allow themselves to be manipulated in any way, by these unnecessary distractions, so as not to make a mockery of the entire thing.	However, dis development no disturb us at all, bikos we believe ontop credibility and ability of di National Assembly and also for di Presidency to do di correct thing, make dem no enter manipulate in any way, with dis unnecessarydistractions dem, make dem for no make mockery of do whole thing.	however, we no dey bother about all these wahala wey dey happen because we get faith for the credibility and power of the national assembly and even the presidency to do the correct thing. dem no go allow demself to be play like mumu in any way, by all these unnecessary wahala, so dem no go come make the whole thing look like say na joke.
528	The known practical and antagonist of this Bill has remained ICAN for reason that is now becoming obvious.	Na ICAN be di practical and antagonist for dis bill and we don dey see di reason now.	di person wey we sabi say dey practical and dey oppose dis bill na ican, and di reason why dem dey do so don clear well well now.
529	They engaged several bystanders into writing frivolous petitions some even targeted at the leadership of the Senate with a tone of blackmail.	Dem engage several bystanders into make dem write bad petition, dem even target di leadership for inside Senate, and e sound like say na bleckmail.	dem don involve plenty onlookers make dem write yeye petition, some sef dey point finger for senate leadership with blackmail kind talk.
530	Having failed woefully at the senate, the antagonists shifted their attention to the House of Representatives with the same bystanders writing all manner of publication.	As dem don fail for inside Senate, di antagonist shift attention go House of Representative with di same bystanders as dem just dey write many many publication.	as dem no succeed at all for senate, the people wey dey oppose come move their attention go house of representatives with the same onlookers wey dey write all kind yawa publication.
531	Yet again, they failed.	and again, dem fail.	dem don fail again.
532	Ordinarily by legislative procedure, a bill that has been passed by the Senate would only require concurrence by the House safe for where there are observations.	Ordinarily according to legislative procedure, bill wey Senate don passgo only need concurrence by di House except wen dem get observation.	ordinarily by law way, na bill wey senate don pass na im go just need agreement by house except where dem get observations.
533	But in the case of the CIFIPN Bill, the antagonist fought the passage of the bill until truth prevail and on the 19th May, 2021 the Bill for the establishment of the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of what Standard Knowledge and Skills to be Attained by Persons seeking to become Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matters (HB. 791) was passed into law by the House of Representative.

534	ICAN has now registered its Bill in the House of Representatives titled (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.	ICAN don register dem own Bill for inside di House of Respresentatives wey dem title  (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.	ican don register dia bill for house of representatives wey dem call am (repealing and re-enactment of icans act.
535	This ICAN new Bill has in it full of provision for practice of forensic, and also that they will establish a Forensic University in Nigeria and without which nobody can practice forensic in Nigeria, and violation of this section will lead such a person to some years imprisonment.	Di new Bill wey ICAn bring get contain full provision to dey take practice forensic, plus say dem wan establish forensic university for inside Nigeria, and without am, nobodi go fit practice forensics for Nigeria, and pesin wey violate am go enter prison for some years.	dis new ican bill wey dem just bring out get plenty provision for practice of forensic, and sef dem go create forensic university for nigeria and if no be so, nobody fit practice forensic for nigeria, and if person no follow dis section, e go land am for prison for some years.
536	This sounds so strange in a country full of enlightened people.	Dis wan dey strange for ear for inside kontri wey plenty oepn eye pipo dey.	dis one dey sound so odd for we country wey full with people wey sabi book well well.
537	My joy is that Nigeria is not a Banana Republic	D tin wey make me api be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic	my happiness na say nigeria no be banana republic
538	no matter the level of corruption therein.	No mata di level of coruption wey dey dere.	no matter how di corruption reach for inside.
539	We are already challenging the passage of the bills by the House of Representatives.	We don dey challenge as House of Representatives take pass bill.	we don already dey challenge the passage of the bills by the house of representatives.
540	It should be noted that, our challenging the bill is not borne out of malice or ill will, but because we are certain that the purpose of this bill is to halt presidential assent under the guise of existence of similar legislation.	We suppose note am say, as we dey challenge di bill no be for bad belle, but bikos say we dey certain say di purpose of di bill na to stop presidential assent under di disguise say similar legislation don dey before.	make we no forget say, we dey challenge dis bill no be because of bad belle or wicked mind, but na because we sure say the aim of this bill na to stop president from gree for the bill under the disguise say similar law dey already.
541	We will not allow ourselves and Nigerians to be deceived by their antics.	We no go gree make dem deceive us and Naija people with dem wayo.	we no go allow dem use dia wayo deceive us and nigerians.
542	You would recall how ICAN vehemently opposed this enactment of CIFIPN and in one of its sponsored publications by the Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr.(Chief)	You go remember how ICAn take open eye oppose di CIFIPN and for inside one pubication wey dem sponsor by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr.(Chief)	you go remember how ican strong-headedly no gree for this law wey dem put for cifipn and for one of dem book wey dem sponsor by association of professional bodies of nigeria wey engr.(chief) na im lead.
543	Olumuyiwa Alade on the 24th May, 2019 made frantic efforts to say that ICAN under its enabling laws is empowered to practice Forensics and therefore for CIFIPN Bill to be passed it would amount to duplication of laws, today ICAN is presenting its ACT to be repealed and re-enacted with the inclusion of Forensics in the new law.	Olumuyiwa Alade on 24th May, 2019 make plenty effort to tell us say di law wey dey enable ICAN don give am power to do forensics and to pass di CIFIPN Bill go be like dem just dey duplicate law, but today ICAN don dey present dem law say make dem for include forensics inside di new law.	olumuyiwa alade for 24th may, 2019 try well-well talk say ican under dem own law get power to do forensics and so if dem pass cifipn bill e go be like say dem dey duplicate law, today ican dey present dem act make dem cancel am come put am back with the addition of forensics for the new law.
544	The question is, what has changed?	Di question is, wetin don change?	de question na, wetin don change?
545	The same law that ICAN has always told the public that it has forensics is now seeking for its re-enactment.	Di same law wey ICAN wey ICAN don tell di public say e get forensics kom dey seek say make dem re-enact am.	na di same law wey ican don dey always tell public say dem get forensics na im dem dey find make dem enact am again.
546	As always, while we are not opposed to any group proposing the inclusion of forensics in its laws, we are however concerned that a body should not try to perpetuate itself.	As always, as we no dey oppose any group wey dey propose say make dem include forensics fot dem law, awa concern be say make one bodi no try perpetuate imsef.	as e dey always be, even though we no dey against any group wey wan put forensics inside their law, we dey worry say make no body try to dey continue demself.
547	ICAN and its cohorts have realised their inability to stop the passage of CIFIPN	ICAN and dem cohorts don realise dem inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN	ican and dem group don realise say dem no fit stop the passage of cifipn.
548	so they want to have a body within itself.	So dem wan get one union for demsef.	so dem wan get body wey dey inside itself.
549	What they are scared of is checks and balances, they would not want another professional body to investigate their activities because they know what they are doing to the economy of this nation.	Na checks and balances dey fear dem, dem no go want want make anoda professional bodi to investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis nation.	wetin dey fear dem na checks and balances, dem no go want make another professional body dey investigate wetin dem dey do because dem know wetin dem dey do to the economy of dis country.
550	How can they want to be a judge in their own case?	How dem go wan dey judge dem own case by demsef?	how dem fit wan be judge for their own case?
551	This sounds so strange.	Dis one sound strange welwel.	dis one dey sound so yawa.
552	On this note, we are calling on the National Assembly to beware of the antics of these groups, they cannot be speaking from both sides of their mouth and expect the National Assembly to be cajoled.	On dis note, we dey  call on di National Assembly to beware of di wayo wey dis group get, dey no suppose dey talk from both sides of dem mouth,make dem kom dey  expect to use am cajole National Assembly.	for dis mata, we dey call on top national assembly make dem shine eye for the wayo wayo wey dis groups dey do, dem no fit dey talk from two sides of dem mouth expect say national assembly go gree.

1013	That is why I am perturbed, like many Nigerians, that in a virtual meeting last week with the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari was reported to have asked that the United States considers relocating the African Command (Africom) of its military presently based in the southern German city of Stuttgart to Africa.	Na why i dey upset, like plenty Nigeria pipo, say na for virtual meetin last week wit di di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, na dem report say president Buhari ask United States to consider as dem go take relocate di African Command (Africom) of im military wey dey for Stuttgart for inside southern German city of presently kom Africa.	na why e dey worry me, like plenty nigerians, say for one online meeting wey happen last week with the secretary of state of united states of america, antony blinken, dem talk say president buhari ask say make united states think about to move the african command (africom) of their military wey dey base for southern ger.
1014	It is presumed that with this call, President Buhari is making a pitch for Nigeria to host Africom.	We dey thingk am say wit dis kin call, president Buhari dey make way for Nigeria to host Africom.	dem dey think say with this call, president buhari dey try make nigeria host africom.
1015	In the first place, it was a breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold that meeting with the American Secretary of State.	For di first place, na breach of protocol for  President Buhari to do dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State.	first of all, na break of protocol for president buhari to hold dat meeting with the american secretary of state.
1016	The meeting should have been with Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, who would then transmit the details afterwards to the president.	Dem suppose do di meetin wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, who o kom carri di detail go meet president later.	di meeting suppose don dey with blinken im nigerian opposite number, geoffrey onyeama, wey go come carry di details give president afta everything.

Yes, America na superpower and all, but protocol na protocol and dem soppose follow am strictly  for evri circumstance.	yes o, america na superpower and all dat one, but protocol na protocol and dem suppose follow am strictly for all condition.
1018	Understandably, Nigeria is currently faced with gargantuan internal insecurity issues which seem to defy the best efforts of government and the nation's security establishment in tackling it.	We understand say Nigeria dey face big internal security wahala wey be like say e pass di best effort wey goment and security establishment for inside di nation dey make to take tackle am.	no wahala, e dey clear say naija dey face big-big wahala of internal security wey dey worry us, e be like say e pass government and our security people power to solve am.
1019	Unrelenting terrorist insurgency in the North East, banditry, kidnapping in the North West, farmers/herders clashes all over the country and the targeted killing of security and law enforcement personnel and other Nigerians coupled with the destruction of institutional buildings in the South East, constitute the cocktail of insecurity now ravaging the country.	Terrorist insurgency wey no dey tire for di North East banditry, kidnapping inside di North West, farmers/herders clash dem all over di kontri and as dem dey target and kill security and law enforcement personnel dem and oda Nigeria pipo plus di destruction of institutional building for di South East, na dem join take be di cokctail of insecurity wey don dey ravage di kontri.	no-gree terrorist wahala for north east, banditry, kidnapping for north west, farmers and herders fight everywhere for we country and the way dem dey kill security and law enforcement people and other nigerians join with how dem dey destroy institutional buildings for south east, na im be the mixture of insecurity wey we dey face.
1020	But even at that, the call for the hosting of the Africom on Nigerian soil when considered against the various issues and implications of this move to Nigeria is hardly justified.	But even at that, di call to take host Africom on top Nigeria siol when we consider m against various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria difficult to justify.	but even so, the call to host africom for nigerian ground, when dem consider am with the many wahala and implication wey this move go cause nigeria, e no really get justification.
1021	Africom is one of nine such commands by the American military establishment to exclusively serve American strategic interests around the world.	Africom na one amng nine of dat kind command wey di America military establish say make e dey serve America strategic interest around di world.	africom na one out of nine kind commands wey american military establishment get, wey dem dey use only for american strategic interests all over the world.
1022	By their doctrine and operational modus, these commands, particularly those outside America like Africom, are not set up primarily to concern themselves with the security and law enforcement issues of their area of coverage.	By dem rule and way of operation, dis commands, particularly di ones wey dey outside America like Africom, dem no set dem up primarily to concern demselves wit security and law enforcement issuefor dem area of coverage.	by their teaching and how dem dey operate, these orders, especially those ones wey no dey america like africom, dem no design dem mainly to dey worry about security and law enforcement matter for the area dem dey cover.
1023	They only do so when such issues directly affect American interests in the area and in such situations, they are not mandated to yield their modus operandi and share intelligence with the local security and law enforcement agencies.	Dem only do so when such issue dey affect di interest of America directly for di area and for such situation, dem no dey mandated to yield dem modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agancy dem	dem dey only do am wen such mata dey directly affect american interest for the area and for such situation, nobody dey force dem to change their way of operation and share intelligence with the local security and law enforcement agencies.
1024	If Africom is set up in Nigeria for instance, it will be an island of its own restricting access to Nigerians of all categories and establishing a jurisdiction within the territorial area of the base that will be virtually off limits to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies.	If dem set Africom up for Nigeria for instance, e go be island on im ownas e go restrict access to Nigerians of all category and establishing a jurisdiction withing di teritorial area of di base wey go dey virtually off limit to Nigerian security and law enforcement agancy dem.	if dem set up africom for nigeria for example, e go be like say e dey on im own, e no go allow nigerians of all kind come near, and e go create jurisdiction inside the area wey the base dey wey go dey almost no go area for nigerian security and law enforcement agencies.
1025	As it always happens with American military bases outside America, Africom will be a forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against the host country.	As e dey always apun wit America military base wey dey outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and e go source for act of sabotage and destabilisation against host kontri.	as e dey always happen with american military base wey dey outside america, africom go be forward operating base for wahala intelligence operations and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against the country wey host dem.
1026	In the particular case of Africom, part of its original concept was actually to contain the growing strategic influence of Nigeria in West Africa and Africa following our successful peace enforcement efforts in Liberia and Sierra Leone and our sterling records of peace keeping around the world.	For dis particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na to kontrol as di strategic influence of Nigeria dey grow for West Africa and Africa as we get successful peace enforecement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa beta record of peace keepin around di world.	for dis particular case of africom, part of di original idea na to hold down di growing strategic influence wey nigeria dey get for west africa and africa after our successful peace enforcement work for liberia and sierra leone and our ogbonge record of peace keeping around di world.
1027	Africom's precursor was the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) set up by the Clinton administration to counter Nigeria's strategic interests in Africa.	Di one wey dey before Africom na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey di Clinton administration set up to take counter di strategic interest of Nigeria for inside Africa.	africom na im be the before-before name wey dem dey call africa crisis response initiative (acri) wey clinton administration set up to face nigeria strategic interest for africa.
1028	President Clinton's Secretary of State, the dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, made many secret and open visits to a number of African countries to sell the idea.	Di Secretary of State for president Clinton, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, be visit a nomba of African countries secretly to sell di idea.	president clinton im secretary of state, dat strong-face california lawyer, warren christopher, e do plenty secret and open waka go many african countries to sell dem idea.
1029	But because Nigeria was the target, he pointedly left it out from his itinerary.	But bikos Nigeria na di target, he pointedly komot am from im itinerary.	but because na nigeria dem target, e purposely no put am for him journey plan.
1030	Senegal, which is not far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, was to be the coordinating base of the ACRI and though it was touted as an initiative to facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, its secret protocols were unmistakably military and strategically targeted at Nigeria.	Senegal, wey no far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, na im suppose be di coordinating base of di ACRI and though dem see am initiative to facilitate assistance of America to African humanitarian issues, im secret protocol dem mistake for military and dem target Nigeria strategically.	senegal, wey no far from liberia and sierra leone, na im dem plan say go be the center to arrange things for acri. even though dem dey shout say na to help america assist africa for humanitarian matter, the secret agreement na clear military and strategic plan against nigeria.
1031	Due mainly to undisguised hostility to the idea from France, which was averse to seeing the Americans trying to butt into an area it considers its exclusive sphere of influence, the ACRI concept was reviewed.	Due mainly to undisguised hostility to di idea from France, which was averse to seeing di Americans trying to butt into an area it considers its exclusive sphere of influence, dem review di concept of di ACRI.	na mostly because of the open wahala wey france get for the idea, wey no wan see americans dey try poke-nose for area wey dem believe say na only dem get power, na im dem come look the acri concept again.
1032	In the review, which drew the expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions midwifed by the American congress in secret sessions, the Americans considered and realised the need to set up an African command to add to the other commands already in place covering the various continents of the world.	For di review, wey draw di expertise of america Military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey di America congress carry kom for dem secret sessions, di Americans dem consider and realise di need to set up one AFrican command to add to di oda command wey don dey already and dey cover oda continent for inside di world.	for di review, wey pull di sabi of american military, intelligence, political and academic people and institutions wey american congress arrange for secret meeting, di americans reason am see say dem need to set up african command join di other commands wey don dey ground dey cover different area.
1033	Thus based on recommendations of these assemblage of experts drawn from all facets of American political and security establishments, Africom was set up by the Bush Junior administration with a wider mandate not just to contain Nigeria but also to keep an eye on the growing Chinese strategic penetration of Africa.	Thus, to follow on di reccomendation of experts wey gather, wey dem kom form all angle of political and security establishments for inside America, na di Bush Junior administration set Africom up wit mandate wey wide pass to contain Nigeria but also to keep eye on top di strategic penetration wey Chinese pipo dey do for inside Africa.	so, base on wetin dis group of experts wey come from all side of american political and security people talk, na im bush junior administration take set up africom with broad power no be only to hold nigeria down but also to dey watch the way china dey enter africa well well.
1034	Africom will be to Africa what US Central Command (USCENTCOM), based in Florida, is to the Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), based in Stuttgart, Germany, is to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), also based in Florida, is to Latin America and the Caribbean.	Na as US Central Command (USCENTCOM) take be to Middle East and Asia, na so Africom go be to Africa, as e base for Florida, European Command (EUCOM), as e base for Stuttgart, Germany, is to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), also based in Florida, is to Latin America and di Caribbean.	africom go be to africa wetin us central command (uscentcom), wey dey florida, be to middle east and asia, european command (eucom), wey dey stuttgart, germany, be to europe and southern command (southcom), wey also dey florida, be to latin america and the caribbean.
1035	Nigeria is already surrounded by French military presence in Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin.	Di presence of French military don surround Nigeria already as dem dey for Niger, Cameroun, Chad and Benin.	nigeria don already dey surrounded by french military presence for niger, cameroon, chad, and benin.
1036	The Americans also have a drone base in Niger.	Di America pipo also get drone base for inside Niger.	americans sef get drone base for niger.
1037	Adding Africom to the mix in Nigeria will amount to a complete capitulation of our strategic interest to both France and America.	To add Africom to di mix for inside Nigeria go amount to a complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America.	put africom join for nigeria matter go just be like say we don surrender our strategic interest give france and america finish.
1038	Bearing in mind that our strategic interests and profile in Africa do not always cohere with those of France and America, the hosting of Africom in Nigeria will be the equivalent of letting in the wolf into the chicken coop.	As we get am for mind say awa strategic interest plus profile for Africa no dey always follow wit di one for France and America, to host Africom for Nigeria go be di same thing like make we allow wolf enter chicken cage.	carry for mind say our strategic interest and profile for africa no dey always gel with that of france and america, to allow africom stay for nigeria go be like say we dey open door for wolf enter where dem dey keep chicken.
1039	There is nothing in the present insecurity challenges facing the country that our armed forces cannot cope with.	Notin dey inside di insecurity cahllenge wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed forces no fit cope wit.	no be anytin dey inside dis present security wahala wey dey face our country wey our armed forces no fit handle.
1040	This is after all the military force that eventually secured Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents in those countries from a long logistical supply line thousands of miles; the army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention but a few of the many gallant Nigerian soldiers who distinguished themselves in those operations.

1041	It is regrettable that the military of Nigeria, having fallen from the high standards known of it, is struggling now to cope with the activities of non-state actors internally.	E dey regretable say di Nigeria military, don fall from high standard wey dem take know dem, dem dey struggle now to cope wit di activity of non-state actors internally.	e dey pain say nigeria military, wey don fall from di high standard wey people know dem for, dey struggle now to handle di wahala wey people wey no be government dey cause for inside country.
1042	But intrinsically and essentially, the Nigerian military retains the capacity and capability to defeat these threats to our national security given the right leadership, doctrine and motivation.	But intrinsically and essentially, di military for Nigeria still carry di capacity and capability to defeat dis threat to awa nationl security if dem get di correct leadership, doctrine plus motivation.	but for inside and true-true, the nigerian military still get the power and ability to beat these wahala wey dey threaten our national security, as long as dem get correct leadership, doctrine and ginger.

1044	But despite our circumstances be arm-twisted into hosting the Africom in view of its antecedents and implications to our strategic interests, on our soil.	But as dem don hold us for hand to take host Africom with awa circumstance in view of im antecedent and implication to awa strategic interest, for awa soil.	but even though dem dey force our hand to host the africom, considering wetin e mean before and the wahala e go cause for our strategic interests, for our own land.

1246	By Segun Tomori	By Segun Tomori	by segun tomori

1252	While the foot-dragging of the governors on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary is condemnable and runs contrary to the spirit of true federalism to which they clamour, the bulk of their resolutions are actually a cardinal tenet of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to which Gov. El-Rufai- led committee on True Federalism made far-reaching recommendations.	As dem suppose condemn di way gobernos dem dey take drag leg on top financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary and e no follow di spirit of true federalism which dem dey call for, planty for inside dem resolution na tenet for di ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) wey di committee wey Gov.

Instead, we see attempt to take play to di gallery and for some quarter,  subtle censure of di governor dem.	instead, we see dem try to show demself for public and for some side, small-small blame dey for the governors.

1258	Despite the rating of Nigeria as the country with the highest GDP in Africa, we are yet to make sufficient efforts to translate that to improved standards of living for the majority of our citizens.	Despite as dem rate Nigeria as kontri wey get highest GDP for inside Africa, we still neva make better effort wey reach to translate am to take improve standard of living or di majority of awa kontri pipo.	even though dem rate nigeria as the country wey get the highest gdp for africa, we never still do enough work to make sure say e improve the way wey majority of our people dey live.
1259	Our annual budget of about $35 billion, for instance, is grossly inadequate to cater to the needs of an estimated 220 million Nigerians.	For instance now, awa annual budget wey reach $35 billion, e dey very inadequate to take cater for di need of 220 million Nigeria pipo.	our yearly budget wey reach like $35 billion, for example, no reach at all to take care of the needs of we country people wey dem estimate say dem reach 220 million nigerians.
1260	South Africa with about 58 million people had a National budget of almost $75bn in 2019 with her Social Protection Programmes reaching 17m of its population	South Africa wey get about 58 million pipo get National budget wey reach $75bn for 2019 and her Social Protection Programme reach 17m of im populatiom	south africa wey get about 58 million people bin get national budget wey reach almost $75bn for 2019, and dia social protection programmes touch light like 17m of dem people.
1261	The efforts of the Buhari administration, though novel and commendable, still represent a drop in an ocean and are not adequate to make the required impact.	Di effort wey di Buhari administration dey make, though na new way and e dey commendable, na just drop for inside ocean and e no dey adequate to make required impact.	di work wey buhari administration dey do, even though na new one and we fit clap for dem, e still be like drop for inside ocean and e no reach to make di kain effect wey we want.

1265	The present system where states come cap in hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations in the country breeds indolence, runs contrary to the principle of true federalism.	Di present system wia state dey go Abuja to go kolekt federal allocation for inside di kontri dey breed indolence, e no follow di principle of true federalism.	dis current way wey states dey carry hand go abuja collect federal allocation for we country, e dey cause laziness, e no follow the principle of true federalism.

1268	For too long we have gone around fear of abuse of state police, we have tried to turn a blind eye to the obviously overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria Police force that has become not only overly inefficient, but largely a conundrum.	For too long, we don dey waka round fear of abuse of state police, we don turn blind eye to di centralised Nigeria Police Force wey don dey overstretched and wey don bikom inefficient and big problem.	for tay we don waka dey fear say dem go abuse state police, we don try close eye for the nigeria police force wey don too stretch and centralize reach where e no fit work well again, e don turn big wahala.

1271	One of the ways that can be done is by enacting a legal instrument for the establishment of the State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), alongside constitutional amendments that will permit State Police.

1272	It would be similar in functions to the Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but have wider powers to exercise appointive and regulatory functions.	E go dey similar function wit Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but e go get wider power to take exercise appointive plus regulatory function dem.	e go resemble federal police service commission (psc) for how e dey work, but e go get broad power to dey appoint and regulate things.
1273	The ban on open grazing though restated by the governors is not new and forms the fulcrum of the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) approved by the National Executive Council (NEC).	Do ban on top open grazing wey di governors dem restate no be nwe thing, e dey part of di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey National Executive Council (NEC) approve.	di ban on top open grazing wey governors don talk again no be new thing and na im be the main thing for national livestock transformation plan (nltp) wey national executive council (nec) approve.
1274	The International Crisis Group (ICG) touts the NLTP as Nigeria's most comprehensive  effort to date to overhaul the inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.	Di International Crisis Group (ICG) don put di NLTP as di most comprehensive effort wey Nigeria don make to date to take overhaul di inefficient and grosly underperforming livestock system.	international crisis group (icg) dey hail di nltp as naija most kajad work wey dem don do so far to change di way wey no dey work and wey no dey bring better result for dema livestock system.
1275	At the core is a strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing and thus lower the risk of conflict between herders and farmers It, therefore, beggars belief that some myopic, self-acclaimed ethnic champions choose to lampoon the ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.	For di core na strategy to take  curb migratory or open grazing and thus lower di risk of conflict between herders and farmersdem, therefore, beggars belief that some myopic, sef-acclaimed ethnic champions choose to lampoon di ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.	na inside na strategy to stop people wey dey move from place to place to graze and so e go reduce the wahala wey dey between people wey dey rear cow and people wey dey farm. e come dey surprise person say some short-sighted people wey call demself ethnic champions dey mock the ban on olden days, nomadic open grazing.
1276	The federal and state governments should move swiftly to fully implement this novel plan so that we can put the perennial farmers-herders clashes behind us.	Make  di federal and stae goment move very fast to fully implement dis new plan so we go fit put dis farmers-herders clash wey dey apun fromtime to time behind us.	federal and state government suppose quick quick carry out dis new plan so dat we fit forget dis wahala wey dey always happen between farmers and herders.
1277	The convocation of a National Dialogue, a major demand of the Asaba declaration might not be necessary since there is a report of the 2014 National Conference and recommendations of the Gov. El-Rufai -led APC committee on True Federalism.	Di convocation of National Dialogue, wey be major demand of di Asaba declaration fit no dey necessary since report from di 2014 National Conference plus recommendations of di Gov.

E dey almost certain say plenty majority of Nigeria pipo wan live togeda, dem no mind awa differences.	e dey almost sure say plenty nigerians wan stay together, even with all our differences.
