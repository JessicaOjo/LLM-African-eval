107	South African health officials are urging COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Aspen to keep its plant in the Eastern Cape province open.	Amagosa ezempilo eMzantsi Afrika abongoza umenzi wesitofu sokugonya i-COVID-19 i-Aspen ukuba igcine isityalo sayo sivulekile kwiphondo leMpuma Koloni.	south african health authorities are urging aspen, the manufacturer of the covid-19 vaccine, to keep its plant open in the eastern cape province.
108	This follows a Reuters article quoting Aspens senior director saying they may have to shut down as there have been no orders for their rebranded COVID vaccine.	Oku kulandela inqaku leReuters licaphula umlawuli omkhulu wakwa-Aspens esithi kungafuneka bavale njengoko kungakhange kubekho zi-odolo zesitofu sabo sogonyo se-COVID.	the following reuters report quotes the ceo of aspens saying they might have to shut down as there were no orders for their covid vaccine stock.
109	A South African-owned subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Aspen struck a deal with American company Johnson & Johnson in March to package, price, sell and distribute its vaccine in Africa.	Inkampani yaseMzantsi Afrika ephantsi kwenkampani enkulu samayeza i-Aspen yenze isivumelwano nenkampani yaseMelika iJohnson & Johnson ngoMatshi yokupakisha, ixabiso, ukuthengisa kunye nokusasaza isitofu sayo sokugonya e-Afrika.	the south african company under the large pharmaceutical company aspen has made an agreement with the american company johnson & johnson in march to package, price, sell and distribute its vaccine stock in africa.
110	This vaccine was rebranded as Aspenovax.	Esi sitofu sathiywa ngokutsha njenge-Aspenovax.	this stove is as new as aspenovax.
111	The move was hailed by many as there had been much concern about Africas reliance on imported vaccines which were often costly and at times in short supply.	Eli nyathelo liye lanconywa ngabaninzi njengoko bekukho inkxalabo enkulu malunga nokuxhomekeka kweAfrika kumayeza ogonyo asuka kumazwe angaphandle ebesoloko eneendleko kwaye ngamanye amaxesha enqongophele.	this step was widely criticized as there was a great concern about africa's dependence on foreign-made vaccines, which were always costly and sometimes scarce.
112	But there have been no orders for Aspenovax.	Kodwa akukhange kubekho ziodolo ze-Aspenovax.	but there were no aspenovax vaccines.
113	South Africas National Health Department Spokesperson Foster Mohale said the lack of orders is due to low vaccination rates not only at home, but globally.	Isithethi seSebe lezeMpilo kuzwelonke eMzantsi Afrika uFoster Mohale uthe ukunqongophala kwee-odolo kungenxa yamazinga aphantsi okugonya kungekuphela nje ekhaya, kodwa kwihlabathi jikelele.	the national department of health spokesperson in south africa, foster mohale, said the decline in iodine levels is due to not only low consumption at home, but also globally.
114	Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production. 	“Ukuthandabuza kugonyo yenye yezinto ezinegalelo kula mazinga aphantsi ogonyo okanye imfuno yogonyo engaphezulu echaphazela imveliso.	"""questioning is one of the things that contributes to the lower levels of understanding or the desire for higher understanding that undermines production."""
115	Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low.	Kuba ngokucacileyo siyaqonda ukuba abakwishishini, abakwazi ukuqhubeka bevelisa izitofu zokugonya xa besazi ukuba imfuno yogonyo iphantsi kakhulu.	clearly, we understand that business people cannot continue to produce grinding stones if they know that the demand for grinding is very low.
116	"So, we understand the situation where they are, and we sympathize with them,"" he said."	Ke, siyayiqonda imeko abakuyo, kwaye siyavelana nabo,” utshilo.	"""yes, we understand the situation they are in, and we sympathize with them,"" he said."
117	Mohale said for now, South Africa has enough vaccines.	UMohale uthe okwangoku, uMzantsi Afrika unezitofu ezaneleyo.	mohale said that currently, south africa has enough tofu.
118	He adds that in March, 100,000 vaccines expired.	Wongeza ngelithi ngoMatshi, amayeza ogonyo ayi-100,000 aphelelwe lixesha.	add by saying in march, the diarrhea medicine of 100,000 has run out of time.
119	And more are due to expire in June and July.	Kwaye ngaphezulu kulindeleke ukuba ziphelelwe ngoJuni nangoJulayi.	and it is expected to be completed by june and july.
120	However, he said that Aspens vaccine plant is important because no one knows what the future holds.	Nangona kunjalo, uthe isityalo sokugonya i-Aspens sibalulekile kuba akukho mntu waziyo ukuba ikamva lisiphathele ntoni.	even so, he said the aspens forest is important because no one knows what the future holds for us.
121	We will try to engage them not to rush their decision precisely because we anticipate especially our scientists, our epidemiologists, we anticipate that the fifth wave might hit the country, South Africa, during the winter season which is a few weeks away from now. 	Siza kuzama ukuthetha nabo ukuba bangasingxameli isigqibo sabo ngokuchanekileyo kuba silindele izazinzulu zethu, iingcali zethu zezifo, ukuba iliza lesihlanu lingabetha ilizwe loMzantsi Afrika ngexesha lasebusika elisele kwiiveki ezimbalwa ukusuka ngoku.	we will try to talk to them about not rushing their decision because we are waiting for our ancestors, our disease experts, to see if the fifth wave will hit south africa during the remaining few weeks of winter.
122	"As you can see the number of daily COVID-19 patients has been rising for the past seven days,"" he said."	Njengoko ubona inani lezigulana ze-COVID-19 zemihla ngemihla zinyuka kwezi ntsuku zisixhenxe zidlulileyo,”utshilo.	"""as you see the number of daily covid-19 cases increasing over the past six days,"" he said."
123	Professor Petro Terblanche, who is the managing director of South African company, Afrigen, which in a continent-first made an mRNA COVID vaccine using Modernas data — said the situation at Aspen is a tragedy for the industry.	Unjingalwazi uPetro Terblanche, ongumlawuli wenkampani yaseMzantsi Afrika, i-Afrigen, ethe kwilizwekazi lokuqala yenza isitofu sokugonya i-mRNA COVID isebenzisa Idatha yeModernas - uthe imeko yase-Aspen yintlekele kwishishini.	petro terblanche, the director of south african company afrigen, said that in the first world, they are making a covid mrna vaccine using moderna's data - he said the situation at aspen is a disaster for the business.
124	This is just indicating again how important it is that this continent looks at policy reform. 	“Oku kubonisa kwakhona indlela ekubaluleke ngayo ukuba eli lizwekazi lijonge uhlengahlengiso lomgaqo-nkqubo.	"""this again shows the importance of this country looking at the reform of the process."""
125	This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies.	Oku kumalunga nendlela esiza kuqinisekisa ngayo ukuba sinikezela ngokukhethekileyo kwiinkampani zasekhaya.	this is about the way we will ensure that we specifically provide for local companies.
126	How are we going to make sure that we create a marketplace and eco-system that will absorb local capacity?	Siza kuqinisekisa njani ukuba sivelisa indawo yokuthengisa kunye ne-nkqubo yendalo eya kuthatha umthamo wasekhaya?	how do we ensure that we develop the local market and the natural process that will take the home advantage?
127	"Otherwise, we will not have capacity locally in a sustainable manner and were going to get the next pandemic and we will be unprepared, and we will not have health security,"" said Terblanche."	Ngaphandle koko, asiyi kuba nomthamo wasekhaya ngendlela ezinzileyo kwaye siyakufumana ubhubhane olandelayo sibe singalungiselelanga, kwaye asiyi kuba nokhuseleko lwezempilo, ”utshilo uTerblanche.	"""without this, we will not have the domestic excitement in a profound way and we will get the next pandemic unprepared, and we will not have health security,"" said terblanche."
128	She believes money should also be put into educating people on the importance of vaccines.	Ukholelwa ukuba imali kufuneka ifakwe ekufundiseni abantu ngokubaluleka kwezitofu zokugonya.	it is believed that money should be invested in educating people about the importance of recycling bins.
129	We need to ensure that we also put effort into advocacy for vaccination. 	“Kufuneka siqinisekise ukuba sikwabeka iinzame zokuxhasa ugonyo.	"""we need to ensure that we put in efforts to support the cause."""
130	Because we now have 17% of the continent that is vaccinated.	Kaloku ngoku sine-17% yelizwekazi eligonyiweyo.	currently, we have 17% of the world's endangered species.

Ungomnye wabaninzi ababanjiweyo kwingxaki ecacileyo yokuchasa kunye nabo banokucela umngeni kumandla kaNkosana uMohammed.	he is one of many who are trapped in the severe problem of poverty and they can ask for help from the power of young master mohammed.
210	One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession.	Omnye weyona mizekelo ibalaseleyo ngowayesakuba yinkosana u-Mohammed bin Nayef, umhlobo weCIA ohlonitshwa eNtshona ngeenzame zakhe zokulwa nobundlobongela obugqithileyo, kodwa ngubani owagxothwa nguKumkani uSalman kumgca wokulandelelana.	one of the most notable casualties was prince mohammed bin nayef, a cia ally respected in the west for his efforts to combat terrorism, but who was ousted by king salman in the line of succession.

Kwabo banabantu ababathandayo abavalelwa kude, ukubulawa kukaKhashoggi kunyusa uloyiko olufanayo malinga nokuthetha ngokukhululekileyo.	among those who love them are people who are far away, khashoggi's murder raises a similar fear when speaking freely.

327	Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign.	Ubuntatheli bamtsala umdla kuba ibali loMbindi Mpuma belisoloko libaliswa ziintatheli ezingamadoda, alapha ekhaya nakwamanye amazwe.	my storyteller friend was excited because the story of mbindi mpuma was always told by male storytellers, both here at home and in other countries.
328	The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East, 	Ibali alitshintshanga ngenxa yoko, kodwa ukuba iintatheli zasekhaya kunye nezamazwe ngamazwe zabasetyhini bafumana ithuba lokwenyani lokubalisa ibali loMbindi Mpuma,	the story did not change because of that, but if local and international journalists got a chance to tell the true story of mbindi mpuma,
329	"that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region,"" Abbas said."	ibali lingatshintsha, elinokuthi lichaphazele indlela abanye abawubona ngayo lo mmandla,”utshilo uAbbas.	"""the story can change, it can influence the way others see this power,"" said abbas."

360	As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void?	Njengoko bambalwa abantu baseMelika abaya eCaweni, ingaba iivenkile zekofu zinako ukuzalisa ililize?	as few americans go to caweni, can coffee shops make a profit?
361	Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society.

362	But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.

363	For so much of American history, the church has really been — or their congregations have really been — essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities … encouraging civic engagement and political participation, says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.	Kwimbali enkulu yaseMelika, icawe ibiyeyona nto ibalulekileyo - okanye amabandla abo ebebalulekile, ebonelela ngendima engachazwanga ekuboneleleni ngentsebenziswano kunye nokunxibelelana eluntwini ...

364	It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church, Cox says.	“Ayizange ibe sisenzeko nje okanye ithamsanqa ukuba umbutho wamalungelo abantu uphume ecaweni,” utshilo uCox.	"""it was never a coincidence or luck that my human rights organization emerged from the wilderness,"" said cox."
365	And you see that cross-culturally … whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important.	Kwaye uyayibona loo nto ngokwenkcubeko ... nokuba kukwiindawo ezihlala abantu abamhlophe ubukhulu becala, kwiindawo ezisemaphandleni, naphi na apho, iicawe bezikade zibalulekile ngokwembali.	and you see that thing culturally ... even in places where white people live in large numbers, in rural areas, and wherever, traditional beers have always been important in ceremonies.
366	Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says.	Iinkonzo kunye nezinye izindlu zonqulo nazo ziye zadlala indima ekuncedeni abantu abavela kwamanye amazwe ukuba bafane bakuba befikile eMelika, utshilo uCox.	services and other religious institutions have played a role in helping people from other countries feel as though they have arrived in america, said cox.

396	Are COVID-19 Restrictions Stunting Children’s Immune Systems?	Ingaba izithintelo ze-COVID-19 ziyawoyisa amajoni omzimba abantwana?	do covid-19 vaccines cause side effects in children's bodies?
397	Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.	Ezinye iingcali zonyango zivakalise inkxalabo yokuba amanyathelo othintelo lwe-COVID-19, njengokugquma imaski kunye nokufundela emakhaya, anokuthi enze buthathaka amajoni omzimba wabantwana ngokubakhusela kwizigulo eziqhelekileyo zobuntwana.	some parents have expressed concern that covid-19 prevention measures, such as wearing masks and homeschooling, may potentially harm children's immune systems by protecting them from common childhood diseases.
398	There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things, says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.	Zininzi izizathu zokukholelwa ukuba abantwana kufuneka bavezwe kwizinto zokugcina amajoni emizimba yabo enamandla, ukuze ukuba bathe badibana nento eyingozi kakhulu, banamanye amajoni omzimba okunokuthi awele kwaye ancede abakhusele kwezo zinto. Utsho uSara Sawyer, unjingalwazi webhayoloji yemolekyuli, yeselula kunye nophuhliso kwiYunivesithi yaseColorado Boulder.	there are many reasons to believe that children need to be exposed to things that strengthen their immune systems, so that if they encounter something very dangerous, they have additional immune defenses that can fall back and help protect them from those things. this is according to sara sawyer, a professor of molecular biology, virology and development at the university of colorado boulder.
399	At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.	Ekuzalweni, iintsana ezisesichengeni zifumana izilwa-buhlungu ezisuka kunina kubisi lwebele, oluzinceda luzikhusele de zibe nokwakha owazo amajoni omzimba.	during breastfeeding, babies in the womb receive antibodies from their mother's breast milk, which helps protect them and build their own body's immune system.
400	Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up.	Akuyongozi ukuba iintsana ziqalise ukubeka izinto emilonyeni yazo ngokukhawuleza nje ukuba zizuze ubugcisa obaneleyo bokuthatha izinto.	it is not unusual for babies to start putting things in their mouths quickly in order to develop the necessary coordination to handle objects.
401	They're doing that because they're sampling the environment and building their immunity. 	“Bayenza loo nto ngenxa yokuba bavavanya imekobume kwaye bakha amajoni omzimba.	"""they did that because they were mixing cement and building body bricks."""
402	"That's an evolutionary trait,"" Sawyer says."	Luphawu lokutshintsha kwezinto,” utshilo uSawyer.	"""it's a sign of change,"" said sawyer."
403	Theyre exposing their body to germs in a certain, level way to build their immunity. 	“Baveza imizimba yabo kwiintsholongwane ngendlela ethile, ekumgangatho wokwakha amajoni emizimba yabo.	"""they exposed their bodies to viruses in a certain way, at the level of building antibodies in their bodies."""
404	"So, some people would argue that childhood illnesses, like colds and stomach bugs, build our immunity so that when more dangerous things come along, we're prepared and we don't get as sick from those more dangerous things."""	"Ngoko ke, abanye abantu banokuthi izigulo zobuntwana, ezinjengokubanda kunye nesisu, zakha amajoni omzimba ukuze xa kuvela izinto eziyingozi ngakumbi, sizilungiselele kwaye singaguli ngenxa yezo zinto ziyingozi."""	therefore, some people can say that childhood illnesses, such as colds and diarrhea, build the body's antibodies so that when more dangerous things occur, we are prepared and do not get sick because of those dangerous things.
405	Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.	Ngaphambi kwesifo sikazwelonke, ubungqina be-epidemiology bacebisa ukuba abantwana abakumazwe aphuhlileyo, apho ukuhlanjwa kwezandla kunye nokusetyenziswa kwesicoci sezifo kuxhaphake kakhulu, banokuba namajoni omzimba angaphuhlisiyo xa kuthelekiswa nabantwana abakumazwe asakhasayo abasoloko bedibana neebhaktheriya ezininzi, iintsholongwane kunye nezinto ezinokuthi zenzeke.	before the global pandemic, epidemiology experts warned that children in developing countries, where hand washing and disease disinfection are severely lacking, could have non-resistant body germs when compared to children in developed countries who are constantly exposed to many bacteria, viruses and potential incidents.
406	"This makes kids in more industrialized countries more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases, according to whats known as the ""hygiene hypothesis."""	"Oku kwenza abantwana kumazwe ahambela phambili kwezoqoqosho babe sesichengeni sokuphuhlisa izifo ezizimelayo, ezaziwa ngokuba yi ""hygiene hypothesis."""

407	The hygiene hypothesis is actually quite controversial because it's thought that our exposure to microbes isn't the only factor, says Cody Warren, a virologist and immunologist who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder.	“IHygiene Hyphothesis eneneni iyaxabanisa kuba kucingelwa ukuba ukudibana kwethu neentsholongwane ayisiyiyo yodwa into,” utshilo uCody Warren, ugqirha wentsholongwane kunye nogcino lwamajoni omzimba osebenza  kwiYunivesithi yaseColorado Boulder.	"""the hygiene hypothesis is really fascinating because it suggests that our interaction with microbes is not the only thing,"" said cody warren, an infectious disease doctor and immune system researcher at the university of colorado boulder."
408	A lot of this could also be dictated by genetics, diet, and the environment that we live in. 	“Uninzi lwale nto lunokuchazwa lufuzo, ukutya, kunye nendawo esihlala kuyo.	"""much of this thing can be explained by hunger, food, and the place we live in."""
409	That also shapes our immune system… it's a real multifactorial thing that we can't fully account for just by wearing masks.	Oku kubumba amajoni ethu omzimba… yinto yokwenyani enezinto ezininzi esingenako ukuziphendulela ngokupheleleyo ngokunxiba iimaski.	building our body's immunity... is a complex matter with many aspects that we cannot fully answer by wearing masks.

411	Warren, the father of three young children, says spending lots of time outdoors is one way to balance the negatives of isolation.	UWarren, utata wabantwana abathathu abancinci, uthi ukuchitha ixesha elininzi ngaphandle yenye yeendlela zokulinganisa izinto ezingalunganga zokuba wedwa.	warren, the father of three young children, says spending a lot of time alone without any way to balance things can lead to unhealthy solitude.
412	Just exploring microbes in the environment also is benefiting [and] training our immune system, Warren says.	“Ukuphonononga nje iintsholongwane kwindawo esingqongileyo kuluncedo [kwaye] nokuqeqesha amajoni ethu omzimba,” utshilo uWarren.	"""just eliminating the viruses in a confined space is helpful [and] training our body's soldiers,"" said warren."
413	Our immune systems get trained through the foods that we eat, which also have microorganisms on them. 	“Amajoni ethu omzimba aqeqeshwa ngokutya esikutyayo, okunezinto ezincinci esingaziboniyo kuko.	"""our body's cells are trained by the food we eat, which contains tiny things we can't see."""
414	"And so, despite the fact that we've kind of been hunkered down a little bit, I do feel that our immune systems will catch up."""

418	But also, equally important is making sure our children have a good diet and they regulate stress. 	Kodwa kwakhona, okubaluleke ngokulinganayo kukuqinisekisa ukuba abantwana bethu banokutya okufanelekileyo kwaye balawula uxinzelelo.	however, equally important is ensuring that our children have adequate food and control stress.
419	"It's been well documented that both of those — having a good diet, a less stressful environment — can have a positive impact on our immune system."""

420	Once public health officials say masks are no longer necessary, Sawyer thinks pointing out the positives of putting our masks away could reassure hesitant parents who worry about their children getting sick.	Nje ukuba amagosa ezempilo karhulumente athi iimaski azisafuneki, uSawyer ucinga ukuba ukukhomba izinto ezintle zokubeka iimaski zethu kunokuqinisekisa abazali abathandabuzayo abanexhala lokugula kwabantwana babo.	just because the government health officials say masks are no longer needed, sawyer thinks that showcasing the positive aspects of our masks is better than reassuring worried parents who have a fear of their children getting sick.
421	Maybe we should have a public conversation about the possible reasons to take that mask off, if they are in school, and get back to the normal repertoire of relatively safe childhood illnesses, she says.	“Mhlawumbi kufuneka sibe nencoko esidlangalaleni malunga nezizathu ezinokubakho zokususa lo maski, ukuba basesikolweni, kwaye sibuyele kwindawo eqhelekileyo yezigulo zobuntwana ezikhuselekileyo,” utshilo.	"""perhaps we need to have a serious conversation about the reasons for removing this mask, if they are at school, and return to the normal place of safe childhood diseases,"" he said."
422	The plus side of childhood illnesses is that they can build up that hornet's nest of immunity that could protect kids aagainst new things that then come along.	Elona cala libalaseleyo lezigulo zobuntwana kukuba banokwakha indlwane ye-hornet yokungakhuseleki enokukhusela abantwana kwizinto ezintsha ezizayo.	one of the ongoing challenges of childhood is to build an unprotective hornet's nest that can protect children from new things to come.

551	Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay.	UMwanyungwe ukwayamanise iCashgate nokuhla kwexabiso lemali yaseMalawi, kwacha, okubangele uqhankqalazo lwabasebenzi abohlukeneyo bakarhulumente befuna ukunyuselwa imivuzo.	mwanyungwe criticized the cashgate scandal and the depreciation of the malawi currency, the kwacha, which caused a protest from various government workers demanding a salary increase.
552	For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money.	Umzekelo, abasebenzi abanika inkxaso kwiinkundla bezikwisithuba seeveki ezintandathu begwayimba, befuna ukunyuselwa imivuzo ngeepesenti ezingamashumi amane anesihlanu ekhulwini nto leyo urhulumente athi akanako ukuyifikelela kuba akanamali.	for example, workers who provide support in the courts were on strike for three weeks, demanding a salary increase of forty-five percent, something the government said it could not afford because it had no money.

UMwanyungwe uthe urhulumente angalunqanda olunye uqhankqalazo ngo-2015 ukuba wenza iinzame zokubuyisela intembeko yabaxhasi kulawulo lwemali karhulumente.	mwanyungwe said the government could have prevented another protest in 2015 if it had tried to restore the confidence of taxpayers in the government's financial management.
555	My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, 	“Uloyiko lwam kukuba, ukuba asinalo ukuzithemba kwabaxhasi kunye nenkxaso yabaxhasi ibuyela kuqoqosho,	"""my fear is that, if there is no confidence and support from the shareholders, it will revert to the business."""

696	African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow.	Amazwe ase-Afrika nawo akakho endleleni yokunciphisa intlupheko ngesiqingatha ngo-2015, kwaye inkqubela yawo iyonke ekunciphiseni indlala ihamba kancinci.	african countries too were not on track to reduce poverty by half by 2015, and their overall progress in reducing hunger is slow.

716	The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers.	Oku kuqhwanyaza kweliso kubangelwe sisityholo semali sikarhulumente apho kwaphangwa ngaphezu kwezigidi ezingama-30 zeerandi kungxowa-mali karhulumente.	the depreciation of the currency is due to the government's financial crisis where over 30 billion rand of government debt was declared.

718	"It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands, ""Msowoya said."	“Kunzima ukuthembisa into eza kwenziwa ngunondyebo. Kodwa kwanele ukuthi imeko yezoqoqosho egqubayo kunye nokunqongophala kohlahlo lwabiwo-mali kuza kwenza kubenzima kancinci ukuba unondyebo athobele amabango,” utshilo uMsowoya.

719	But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met.	Kodwa ngokukaHebert, abahlaseli abazuphinda baqhubeke nomsebenzi de kuhlangatyezwane neemfuno zabo.	but according to hebert, the attackers would not continue their work due to their selfishness and their desires.
