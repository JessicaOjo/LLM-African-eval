A cikin wadannan ranaku yankin kusurwar Afirka musamman kasar Somaliya da take cikin mawuyacin hali yana fuskantar mafi munin bala'in fari da yunwa mai sosa rai sakamakon bayyanar fari a yankin da kin tabuka wani abin a zo a gani da cibiyoyin kasa da kasa suka yi (wajen magance matsalar), hakan ya sanya rayukan miliyoyin musulman kasar Somaliya musamman mata da kananan yara cikin gagarumin hatsari da kuma fuskantar barazana.	within these days, the region of east africa, especially somalia, which is in a dire situation, is experiencing the worst famine and hunger that threatens life due to the severe drought in the region that has caused crops and plants to fail (to address the problem), this has put the lives of millions of somali muslims, especially women and children, in grave danger and also facing starvation.

7	In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful	Da Sunan Allah Mai Rahama Mai Jin Kai	in the name of god, the most merciful, the most compassionate
8	By their nature human beings, require and are eager to worship God and to show humility before Him, God who is the Creator of all goodness and beauties. And prayer fulfills this need.	Dan'adam dai a dabi'arsa, (halitta ce) mai kauna da kuma bukatar addu'a da kuma kankan da kai a gaban Allah Madaukakin Sarki Wanda Shi ne Mahaliccin dukkanin abubuwa masu kyau; ita kuwa salla ita ce mai samarwa da kuma biyan wannan bukatar.	a human being in his nature, (a creature) who loves and needs prayer and humility before allah the almighty king who is the source of all good things; indeed, prayer is what provides and fulfills this need.
9	By making prayers obligatory, divine religions quench the thirst of human nature and save it from confusion and misguidance concerning the quenching of this thirst.	Addinan Ubangiji, ta hanyar shar'anta salla, sun shayar da kishirwar da dan'adam yake fama da ita ne da kuma tseratar da shi daga gagarumar damuwa da kuma batar dake tattare da wannan kishirwa ta dabi'a.	the worship of the lord, through the observance of prayer, has alleviated the suffering that man experiences from it and also protects him from immense distress and the harm associated with this natural suffering.
10	Repeating prayers every day and night is an opportunity and a blessing which saves human beings from drowning in lack of vigilance. It gives human beings the opportunity to have a conscious presence of the heart before God.	Nanata yin salla dare da rana, wata dama da kuma ni'ima ce da take ‘yantar da dan'adam daga fadawa cikin wannan tarko na gafala; da ba shi damar gabatowa da zuciyarsa cikin masaniya a gaban Allah; da goge masa ransa ta yadda badininsa zai yi haske.	i don't know
11	When divine remembrance, prayers and worship combine with the fabric of social life, they reveal the miracle of Islam in the constellation of divine commands.	A yayin da zikiri da salla da addu'a suka hadu da tsari na rayuwa ta zamantakewa, to kuwa mu'ujizar Musulunci ya kan iya bayyana cikin hukumce-hukumcensa na ibada.	at the time when prayer, remembrance, and supplication intersect with the discipline of life's routine, then indeed, the miracle of islam can manifest within its rules of worship.
12	The mosque is a manifestation of this combination.	Masallaci dai wata alama ce da ke nuni da wannan haduwar.	the mosque is a symbol that indicates this convergence.
13	Congregational prayers in the mosque with other believers, is taking part in a divine celebration and this makes the rain of divine mercy heavier and more pleasing.	Salla a masallaci sannan kuma cikin muminai, tamkar zama ne a taburmar bakunci ta Ubangiji, hakan kuma wani lamari ne da ke kara saukar da ruwan rahamar Ubangiji da yawa sannan kuma mai kwantar da hankali.	praying in the mosque and also being among the faithful, is like being in the lap of the lord's fortress, this is also a matter that increases the pouring of the lord's mercy and also the one who is mindful.
14	The blessedness of prayers imbues and enlightens the atmosphere of mosques. And speaking righteous words and teaching religion, ethics and politics in that atmosphere pleases one's heart and soul more than any other atmosphere and it gives a divine orientation to the life of the individual and society.	Albarkacin salla, yanayin masallaci ya kan kara haske da kuma kamshi, sannan kuma fadin gaskiya da koyar da addini da kyawawan halaye da lamurran da suka shafi siyasa su kan sami gindin zama cikin zuciya da kuma rai sama da kowane waje, sannan da kuma ba wa rayuwa ta daidaiku da kuma ta jama'a mahanga irin ta Ubangiji.	with the blessing of prayer, the mosque's atmosphere was increasingly filled with light and warmth, then also speaking the truth and teaching religion with beautiful stories and events that touched politics, they found a place in the heart and mind everywhere, then also giving life a balance and gathering like the lord's crowd.
15	This is how the mosque should be viewed.	Da irin wannan mahangar ce ya kamata a dinga kallon masallaci.	such kind of hatred should be kept out of the mosque.
16	The spirit of the mosque instills dynamism and motivation into the body of life.	Ruhin masallaci yana kara wa tushen rayuwa nishadi da kuma karfin gwuiwa.	the spirit of the mosque brings more joy and strength to life.
17	Wherever there is organized life, the mosque is the main center.	A duk inda aka sami cibiyar rayuwa, to kuwa masallaci shi ne tushe na asali na hakan.	wherever you find the essence of life, indeed the mosque is the original end of it.
18	In the structure of cities and villages, in schools and universities and in other places - from marketplaces to airports, roads, terminals, nursing homes, hospitals, parks and holiday resorts - the mosque should be the pole and the pivot.	Wajibi ne masallaci ya zamanto tushe na gine-gine a garuruwa da kauyuka, a makarantu da jami'oi, a wajajen taruwar al'umma kama daga kasuwanni da wajajen aiki har zuwa ga filayen jiragen sama da manyan hanyoyi da wajajen yada zango, har zuwa ga wajajen shakatawa da asibitoci, a dukkanin wajajen da ake da su.	it is necessary for mosques to become the end of construction in towns and villages, in schools and universities, in the parks of public life, from markets and workplaces to airports and major roads and parks, to entertainment venues and hospitals, in all places where they exist.
19	Everywhere the mosque should be clean, beautiful and calming.	Wajibi ne masallaci a ko ina yake ya zamanto mai tsafta, kyau da kuma kwantar da hankali.	it is necessary for the mosque to be wherever it is, to become clean, beautiful and also peaceful.
20	The material and spiritual management of the mosque, which is shouldered by the clergy in charge of the mosque, should be wise, responsible and even affectionate.	Wajibi ne jagorancin yadda ake gudanar da masallaci wanda yake wuyan malami (limamin) masallacin ya zamanto cikin hikima da jin yanayi na sauke nauyi haka nan kuma cikin so da kauna.	it is the responsibility to manage how the mosque is run, which is under the supervision of the cleric (imam) of the mosque who has become wise and understands the weather conditions for reducing stress, and also with love and affection.
21	If the mosque achieves the quality it deserves, a lot of material and spiritual burdens will be removed from the shoulders of society, the people and government officials.	Matukar dai masallaci ya sami irin yanayin da ya dace, to kuwa nauyi mai yawa na abin duniya da kuma addini da ke wuyan al'umma, mutane da kuma jami'ai zai ragu.	indeed, if the mosque gets the right conditions, then the weight of worldly and religious matters that concern the community, people and institutions will decrease.
22	In the hope of reaching that day and greetings be upon the one remaining with Allah on earth (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake)	Muna fatan ganin wannan ranar, sannan kuma da sallamar mu zuwa ga mai girma Bakiyatullah (Imam Mahdi) rayukanmu su zamanto fansa a gare shi.	we look forward to this day, and also our greetings to the great bakiyatullah (imam mahdi), we hope our lives will be a sacrifice for him.

41	Every year the Leader of the Islamic Revolution issues a message to the great hajj congregation during the hajj season, which contains important points for Muslims of the world.	- A kowace shekara a lokacin aikin hajji, Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci ya kan aike da sako ga mahajjata wanda ya kumshi muhimman lamurran da suka shafi al’ummar musulmi na duniya.	every year during the hajj season, the leader of the islamic pilgrimage often sends a message to the pilgrims addressing important issues affecting the muslim community worldwide.
42	In your opinion, what is the philosophy behind these messages?	A ra’ayinka mene ne falsafar da ke cikin wannan sakon?	what is your opinion on the philosophy in this message?
43	There are a few points that I should mention before answering this question.	Don amsa wannan tambaya, da farko dai wajibi ne a yi karin bayani kan wasu batutuwa.	to answer this question, firstly it is necessary to provide more details about some issues.
44	First of all, hajj â€“ which is an Islamic obligation â€“ pursues great goals.	Da farko shi kansa aikin hajji wanda daya ne daga cikin ayyukan ibada na Musulunci, yana da wasu manyan manufofi da yake son cimmawa.	firstly, he himself is a hajj worker, which is one of the acts of worship in islam, he has some major goals he wants to achieve.
45	Based on the Holy Quran, maybe the biggest goal of hajj is the connection between the Islamic Ummah and the activities of the prophets throughout history. That is to say, according to Sura al-Baqara, it began with the creation of Adam and Eve when angels prostrated in front of them, their experiences in paradise, their banishment to earth and finally their use of their heavenly experiences, including committing sins, repenting and complete submission to divine commands.	Mai yiyuwa ne mafi girman manufar da ke cikin aikin hajjin, kamar yadda muka samo hakan cikin Alkur’ani mai girma shi ne ‘alakanta al’ummar musulmi da ayyukan annabawa cikin tarihi’. Wato kamar yadda ya zo cikin Suratul Bakara – wanda mafarinsa daga halittan dan’adam da sujadar Mala’iku gare shi da irin abubuwan da (annabi) Adamu ya gani a cikin aljanna, sannan daga baya kuma da zuwansa bayan kasa da kuma amfani da irin kwarewar da ya samu a Aljanna wanda ya hada da saba wa doka da kuma tuba da komawa ga Allah Madaukakin Sarki.	the most significant lesson in the pilgrimage work, as we found in the holy qur'an, is to 'link the muslim community with the prophetic events in history'. this is as it came in suratul bakara - whose creation from the clay of man and the prostration of the angels to him and the things that (the prophet) adam saw in paradise, then afterwards with his descent to earth and also the use of the kind of civilization he got in paradise which includes the habit of obedience and repentance and return to allah the almighty king.
46	In order to describe each of these stages, the Holy Quran uses the phrase â€œand whenâ€ which recount the story of all prophets until Prophet Ibrahim when God says, â€œAnd when his Lord tried Ibrahim with certain words, he fulfilled them.	Alkur’ani mai girma yayi bayanin kowane guda daga cikin wadannan lokuta yana mai cewa: ‘kuma a lokacin da’ ‘kuma a lokacin da’ ‘kuma a lokacin da’, dukkanin wadannan ‘kuma a lokacin da’din suna bin diddigin tafarkin annabawa ne har zuwa lokacin da aka zo ga annabi Ibrahim a nan ne ya ce: “Kuma a lokacin da Ubangijin Ibrahim Ya jarrabe shi da wasu kalmomi, sai ya cika masa su.	"the glorious qur'an explains each of these times by saying: 'and when' 'and when' 'and when', all these 'and when' are referring to the deep thoughts of the prophets until the time when prophet ibrahim was mentioned, he said: ""and when the lord of ibrahim tested him with certain words, he fulfilled them."
47	He said: Surely I will make you an Imam of men.	Ya ce: “Lalle ne Ni, Mai sanya ka shugaba domin mutane ne.”	"he said: ""indeed, i am the one who makes you a leader for the people."""
48	My covenant does not include the unjust, said He.â€ [The Holy Quran, 2: 124] It refers to the leadership of God's righteous servants. â€œMy covenant does not include the unjust, said He.â€ This is where the issue of hajj is mentioned: â€œAnd when We made the House a pilgrimage for men and a (place of) security, and: Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on the standing-place of Ibrahim.â€ God brings up the issue of hajj in the middle of the story about the path of His prophets and it appears that Prophet Ibrahim is considered the one who determines the path and the goals of hajj.	Ya ce: “Kuma da zuriyata”, wato yayi bayanin shugabancin salihai ne.	"he said: ""and with offspring"", meaning he explained that it is a leadership of the righteous."
49	The second goal has also been mentioned: making human beings go back to their nature and to the natural path of surrendering to God. And this goal is manifested in all rituals of hajj. Therefore, hajj contains great goals and one of these goals is renouncing polytheists [bara'a] and Prophet Ibrahim was the most important manifestation of renouncing polytheists.	A dabi’ance manufa ta biyu wadda kuma take bisa wannan tafarkin ita ce samar da dan’adam (na hakika), mayar da dan’adam zuwa ga asalin tsarinsa da kuma tafarkinsa na asali na mika kai ga Ubangiji. A kan samu irin wannan gina dan’adam din ne a lokacin aikin hajji. A saboda haka an yi bayanin manyan manufofin aikin hajji wanda daya daga cikinsu shi ne wannan batu na ‘barranta daga mushirikai’.	the second purpose, which is also based on this concept, is to enable man (indeed) to return to his original nature and his original concept of submission to the lord. this kind of human construction is found during the hajj. therefore, the major purposes of the hajj have been explained, one of which is this step of 'purifying from polytheism'.
50	All these things show the unity of Muslims and the Islamic Ummah. These goals are realized during hajj.	Dukkanin wadannan abubuwa ne da suke nuni da dakaitakan mutane da kuma hadin kan al’ummar musulmi.	all these things are indicative of people's oppression and the unity of the muslim community.
51	A manifestation of these goals is mentioned in every one of the messages issued by Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.	Cikin dukkanin irin wadannan sakonni da marigayi Imam (yardar Allah ta tabbata a gare shi) da Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci (Allah ya kara masa tsawon rai) suke fitarwa, su kan yi ishara da wadannan manufofi na hajji ne.	among all these messages that the late imam (may allah's mercy be upon him) and the leader of the islamic revolution (may allah prolong his life) are sending out, they are indicating that these are the evils of pilgrimage.
52	Reviving hajj means reviving the Islamic Ummah and this is the philosophy behind the existence of these messages and the insistence of the Islamic Republic and the Leader on this issue.	Amma dangane da falsafar da ke cikin wannan sakon – wanda shi ne da man tambayar da ka yi – da kuma dalilin da ya sanya Jamhuriyar Musulunci da jagoranta su ke ba wa wannan lamarin irin wannan muhimmancin shi ne cewa rayar da aikin aiki, rayar da al’umma ne.	but regarding the philosophy contained in this message - which is what you asked about - and the reason why the islamic republic and its leadership give this matter such importance, it is because it concerns both work life and community life.
53	Implementing the hajj messages would initiate the movement of the Islamic Ummah.	Tabbatar da sakon hajji yana nufin tabbatar da yunkurin al’umma ne.	confirming the hajj message means confirming the community's effort.
54	According to Islamic narrations, â€œHajj is the flag of Islam.â€ What does â€œflag of Islamâ€ mean?	Ya zo cikin riwaya cewa: Hajji tutar Musulunci ne’. Me ake nufi da tutar Musulunci?	it came in the narrative that: hajji is the pillar of islam. what is meant by the pillar of islam?
55	As long as the flag of an army keeps flying during a battle, it means the army is has not been defeated and the battle is supposed to continue.	A lokacin yaki, a duk lokacin da tuta ta zamanto a dage, hakan yana nufin sojoji suna nan da ransu kuma ana ci gaba da yaki.	during the war, whenever night fell, it meant that the soldiers were there with their lives and the war continued.
56	Therefore, reviving hajj is one of the great goals that the Islamic Republic pursues in order to bring about Islamic Awakening.	A saboda haka rayar da hajji da kuma komawa zuwa ga ruhin hajji da hakan, daya ne daga cikin manyan manufofin Jamhuriyar Musulunci na tabbatar da ‘farkawa ta Musulunci’.	therefore, performing hajj and returning to the spirit of hajj is one of the great objectives of the islamic republic in confirming the 'revival of islam'.
57	In the messages which have been issued by Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, these points have been frequently highlighted.	A saboda haka ne a cikin sakonnin da Imam ya kasance yana fitarwa da kuma wanda Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci ya ke ci gaba da fitarwa ake ba wa wannan lamarin muhimmanci sannan kuma ake gabatar da shi a matsayin wata manufa da ake son cimmawa.	that is why in the letters that the imam was distributing and the one that the leader of the islamic revolution continues to distribute, this important issue is given priority and it is presented as a goal to be achieved.
58	Yes, unfortunately we have failed to understand the importance of the hajj messages. We have failed to make others realize the importance of these messages. We have also failed to convey these messages to those who are far from us.	- To amma daga dukkanin alamu ba a ba wa wannan lamari na sakon hajji muhimmancin da ya kamata wajen yada shi ba. Na’am. Abin bakin ciki ne cewa ba mu iya fahimtar irin girman da wannan sako ya ke da shi ba ballantana ma mu fahimtar da sauran mutanen da suke nesa.	however, from all indications, this issue of the hajj message is not given the importance it deserves in its dissemination. yes. the sad thing is that we do not understand the magnitude of this message, let alone understand it with other people who are far away.
59	Our mass media, our pilgrims and others are making efforts in this regard, but these efforts are not enough considering the importance of these messages.	Akwai kafafen watsa labarai na kungiyoyi da na alhazai da sauransu da suke gudanar da ayyukansu, to amma dai ba sa gudanar da ayyukan na su daidai da irin matsayi da kuma muhimmancin da wannan sakon yake da shi.	there are media outlets for groups and associations and others that carry out their activities, but they do not carry out their activities at the same level and importance as this message has.
60	In order to reach this goal, all media outlets, all cultural advisors, all public relations facilities and all media networks that we have at our disposal should try to convey these messages to different parts of the world.	Wajibi ne dukkanin kafafen watsa labarai, dukkanin ofisoshin al’adu (na Iran da suke waje) da kuma dukkanin kafafen watsa labarai da tashoshin isar da sako ga al’umma da muke da su, su sanya dukkanin karfin da suke da shi wajen isar da wannan sakon zuwa ga dukkanin bangarori na duniya don cimma manufar da ake da ita.	it is the responsibility of all news outlets, all customs offices (in iran and abroad), and all news outlets and channels that broadcast news to the public that we serve, to put all their strength into delivering this message to all corners of the world to achieve the goal we have.
61	We need to make more efforts in this regard.	Wajibi ne a kara kokari a wannan fagen.	it is necessary to make more effort in this phase.
62	Not like this. Only the King of Saudi Arabia issues a message for public relations purposes.	A’a, ba da irin wannan yanayin ba; sarkin Saudiyya ne kawai ya ke fitar da wani sako.	no, it's not like this situation; it's just the king of saudi arabia who is releasing a statement.
63	These messages are made public on the Day of Bara'a.	- Tun da fari ma a ranar barranta daga mushirikai ne ake fitar da wannan sakon ga mutane?	since the beginning, this message has been disseminated to people on her birthday from paganism?
64	But after the conflicts that took place â€“ which was the reason why Iranians did not go on hajj pilgrimage for a few years â€“ certain agreements were made. I was a member of the delegation which was sent to Saudi Arabia for negotiations.	To amma bayan rikicin da aka yi – wanda a dalilin hakan ne Iraniyawa suka yi shekaru ba sa zuwa hajji – an cimma wata yarjejeniya bayan tattaunawa wanda na kasance daga cikin tawagar tattaunawar.	however, after the conflict that occurred - which is why the iranians have not been on pilgrimage for years - a reconciliation was achieved after discussions that were part of the negotiation process.
65	The two sides agreed that Iranian pilgrims should not come together in Mecca and that they could only do so on the day of Arafa to listen to the message of their Leader. Did you also agree to recite Dua Kumeyl in Medina during the same negotiations?	Bangarorin biyu sun cimma yarjejeniyar cewa daga wancan lokacin zuwa sama, kada a gudanar da wani taro a Makka, to amma a wannan rana ta Arafa – wato tara ga watan Zul Hajji – a arafa, a harhada hemomin iraniyawa, alhazai su gudanar da gagarumin taro don a karanta wannan sako na Jagora.	the two factions have achieved the agreement that from that time onwards, no gathering should be held in mecca, but on this day of arafa - which is during the month of zul hajj - in arafa, they should gather a large number of iranians to read this message from the leader.
66	No, the agreement to recite Dua Kumeyl in Medina was reached in other negotiations. This agreement was a separate issue, which was settled after a lot of conflicts and groundwork.	A’a; yarjejeniyar gudanar da Du’a Kumail a wani wajen ne aka cimma ta. Wannan yarjejeniya ce ta daban, bayan dukkanin tattaunawa da rikici.	no; the recitation of du’a kumail was successfully completed somewhere. this recitation is different, after all the discussions and disputes.
67	We claim that the hajj messages are conveyed to Muslim nations.	- Muna da’awar cewa ana fitar da sakon hajji ne ga al’ummomin musulmi.	we have received news that a message of hajj is being released to the muslim community.
68	What effects have these messages produced so far?	Shin ya zuwa yanzu wani tasiri ne wannan sako ya yi a aikace?	has there been any impact now that this message has been sent?
69	Many pilgrims from different countries take part in hajj ceremonies.	Da farko dai a wancan wajen da dama daga cikin alhazan kasashe daban-daban suna zuwa.	firstly, many from different countries are coming to that place.
70	These messages are handed out during hajj. They are translated into around ten languages and are handed out in Mena and other places during the hajj season.	Na biyu dai ana watsa wannan sakon a wajen sannan kuma mai yiyuwa ne ana fassara shi cikin yarurruka daban daban da yada su a lokacin hajjin, a Mina haka nan kuma a wani waje na daban, sannan kuma ya shiga hannun dukkanin alhazai a matsayin sakon juyin juya halin Musulunci.	secondly, this message is being broadcast and then translated into various languages and disseminated during the pilgrimage, in mecca and elsewhere, and then it falls into the hands of all pilgrims as a message of reversing the state of islam.
71	These messages are also broadcast in different languages in some of our media and they have had a good effect on the hearts of Muslims although the entire system of global arrogance as well as Arab and Islamic governments try to stifle these messages.	Haka nan kuma ana watsa shi cikin harsuna daban-daban a kafafen watsa labaran mu don ya yi tasiri mai kyau a zukatan al’ummomin musulmi. A bangare guda kuma dukkanin cibiyoyin girman kan duniya da cibiyoyin gwamnatocin larabawa da na musulmi suna ta kokari wajen hana tasirin wannan sako.	thus, it is being broadcast in various languages on our news channels to have a positive impact on the muslim community. in one aspect, all the major world powers and arab and muslim governments are striving to prevent the impact of this message.
72	One of these messages was once published in a newspaper in England: the entire network of global Zionism protested against that newspaper and created problems for it.	A wani lokaci a baya an taba buga wannan sakon a daya daga cikin jaridun Ingila, dukkanin yahudawan sahyoniya na duniya sun mike wajen ganin bayan wannan jaridar, inda suka haifar mata da matsaloli.	at some point in the past, this message was published in one of the english newspapers, all the zionists jews in the world stood up to see the aftermath of this newspaper, where they caused her problems.
73	When did this happen?	- A wace shekara ne hakan ta faru?	in which year did this happen?
74	The Zionists try to prevent the messages from being published.	Yahudawan sahyoniya suna kokarin hana yaduwar wannan sakon.	the zionist jews are trying to prevent the spread of this message.
75	And not only does the government of Saudi Arabia refuse to help in this regard, but it sometimes tries to prevent these messages from being published.	Haka nan ita ma gwamnatin Saudiyya ba wai ma kawai ba ta taimakawa wajen yada wannan sakon ba ne, a wasu shekarun ma ta kan hana ne. A wasu lokuta ma an sha kama mutane.	thus, the saudi government not only helped in spreading this message, but in some years it also prevented it. sometimes people were even arrested.
76	Of course in the past few years there have been few cases of such arrests, but they try to stifle these messages in Saudi Arabia.	Ko da ya ke a shekarun baya-bayan nan an rage irin wannan kame-kamen. To amma a ko ina suna kokari da kuma tada jijiyoyin wuya wajen ganin karshen wannan sakon.	even though in the past years, this kind of problem has decreased. but wherever they are, they are still striving and making efforts to see the end of this message.
77	Sometimes we try to publish the messages in foreign newspapers and we pay the money, but they do not publish them.	A wani lokaci mu kan yi kokari wajen buga sakon a jaridun waje, mu kan ba da kudi ma amma dai ba a bugawa.	sometimes we try to send messages in foreign newspapers, we usually give money but they are not published.
78	Many newspapers do not allow this or they are prohibited from publishing these messages.	Da dama daga cikin jaridu ba su yarda ko kuma ba a ba su izinin bugawan.	many from the newspaper do not agree or they were not given the permission to publish.
79	In European and even Islamic countries.	Na turai kai hatta ma na musulmi.	i traveled abroad even though i am a muslim.
80	They strongly refuse to publish these messages. But as I said, we have been negligent too.	Alal hakika ba sa bari, to amma kamar yadda na fadi mu ma dai mu kan nuna gazawa.	indeed, they won't give up, but as i said, we too will show resistance.
81	What is the nature of these messages?	- Ya ya yanayin wannan sakon yake?	what is the status of this message?
82	During hajj the pilgrims are representatives of the entire Islamic Ummah.	A wajen dai alhazai wakilan dukkanin al’ummar musulmi ne.	at the forefront, they are representatives of all muslim communities.
83	That is to say, it is the congregation of the entire Islamic Ummah with the purpose of getting closer to God. The pilgrims are trained with slogans, songs and identical rituals.	Sansanin da ake kafawa a wajen a hakikanin gaskiya sansani ne na wakilcin al’umma; wato sansani ne na dukkanin al’ummar musulmi da niyyar neman kusaci da Ubangiji.	the burden that is being carried on behalf of the truth is truly a burden of representing the people; that is, it is a burden of all muslims with the intention of seeking closeness to god.
84	Hajj pilgrims should restrain their eyes.	Wajibi ne alhaji ya kula da idanuwansa.	it is necessary for alhaji to take care of his eyes.
85	They should restrain their mouth and tongue.	Ya kula da baki da harshensa.	he is careful with his mouth and his voice.
86	The things that should be avoided as haraam during ihram are a kind of training for hajj pilgrims.	Abubuwan da aka haramta na ihrami, abubuwa ne masu tarbiyantar da alhaji.	the things that were forbidden are sacred, they are things that educate the pilgrim.
87	I have extracted the themes of the messages issued by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution over the past few years and I can share the result with you if you like. Please go ahead.	Dangane da hakan ni dai na yi darasin wadannan sakonni na Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci da yake fitarwa cikin shekarun nan, idan har kana so sai in gabatar maka da shi.	regarding this, i have studied these messages of the leader of the islamic revolution and its impact over the years, if you want, i can present it to you.
88	If you study the Leader's messages, you will see that the first point that is raised in these messages is the role of hajj in structuring the Islamic Ummah.	Idan har ka dubi sakonnin Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci da kyau, za ka ga cewa batu na farko da ake gabatar da shi a cikin wannan sakon, shi ne rawar da hajji ya ke takawa wajen gina al’ummar musulmi.	if you look closely at the messages of the leader of the islamic revolution, you will see that the first issue he addresses in this message is the role that hajj plays in building the muslim community.
89	This is the goal of the Leader's hajj messages.	Wannan shi ne abin da sakon Jagora ya ke son cimmawa a lokacin hajji.	this is what the message of the leader wants to accomplish during the hajj.
90	For example, one point that is raised in these messages is the role of hajj in eliminating the weak points of the Islamic Ummah.	A matsayin misali rawar da aikin hajji zai iya takawa wajen cike gurbin raunin da al’ummar musulmi suke da shi.	for example, the role and work of hajj can contribute to filling the gap of poverty that the muslim community is dealing with.
91	The next point concerning the role of hajj is that these messages stress the fact that hajj is the flag of Islam.	Batu na gaba a bangaren rawar da hajji ya ke takawa shi ne yana jaddada cewa hajji tutar Musulunci ne.	batu's progress in the competition that hajji is leading is him reaffirming that hajji is the star of islam.
92	In one of his messages, the Leader pointed out that hajj is a manifestation of the movement of the Islamic Ummah and that it defines the role of political Islam.	A cikin daya daga cikin sakonnin Jagora ya yi ishara da cewa hajji ‘alama ce ta yunkurin al’umma’ sannan kuma ‘mai bayanin irin rawar da Musulunci na siyasa yake takawa’ ne.	in one of the letters from the leader, he indicated that pilgrimage is a sign of the community's effort, and also he is 'the one explaining the kind of struggle that islam is facing in politics'.
93	One pillar of hajj is tawaf around the House of God.	Idan har muka lura da tushen aikin hajji, daya daga cikin su shi ne dawafin Dakin Allah.	if we look at the process of hajj, one of them is the pilgrimage to the house of god.
94	That is to say, the entire Ummah is supposed to revolve around and adhere to the guidance of Allah the Exalted.	Wato dukkanin al’umma suna zagaya shari'a da shiriyarwa ta Ubangiji Madaukakin Sarki da kuma riko da hakan.	this means all nations are promoting the law and the will of the almighty king and also agreeing with it.
95	In sum, the first pivot that is mentioned in these messages is the role of hajj in the civilizational course of the Islamic Ummah.	A takaice dai batu na farko da ake yin ishara da shi cikin wannan sakon, shi ne ‘rawar aikin hajji cikin tarihin ci gaban al’ummar musulmi’.	in summary, the first issue highlighted in this message is 'the history of hajj pilgrimage in the advancement of the muslim community'.
96	The second issue is the role of hajj in moral education of individuals and society.	Batu na biyu shi ne rawar da aikin hajji yake takawa wajen ‘tarbiyar kyawawan halaye na jama’a da kuma na daidaiku’.	the second challenge is the role that the hajj plays in educating the public about good morals and values.
97	This is a theme that is present in all of the hajj messages.	Hakan kuwa yana cikin dukkanin sakonnin.	this indeed is in all the messages.
98	The issue of self-purification and appreciating this opportunity in the holy places that are related to hajj, are definitely mentioned somewhere in the messages.	Ko shakka babu tun daga farkon sakon zuwa karshe za a yi ishara da batun tsarkake zuciya da kuma amfanuwa da irin damar da aka samu a wajaje masu tsarki wadanda suke da alaka da aikin hajji.	there is no doubt that from the beginning to the end of the message, it will highlight the purification of the heart and the benefits of the opportunity obtained in holy places related to the hajj pilgrimage.
99	Showing the greatness of Islam and its messages is the third theme that is mentioned in these messages.	Batu na uku a cikin wannan sakon shi ne ‘nuna irin girman da Musulunci yake da shi da kuma sakon da ke tattare da shi’.	the third point in this message is 'to show the greatness that islam has and also the message associated with it'.
100	They highlight the greatness of Islamic solutions to the problems of humanity.	Haka nan da ishara da hanyoyin da Musulunci yake da su na magance matsalolin da bil’adama suke fuskanta.	this is a sign and the ways in which islam has to address the problems that humanity faces.
101	Highlighting the issue of Muslim unity is another theme that is highlighted in these messages.	Batu na gaba shi ne jaddadawa dangane da batun hadin kan musulmi wanda musamman a cikin sakon Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci, mafi muhimmancin abin da ke nuni da hanyar cimma wannan hadin kan shi ne wannan farkawa ta Musulunci.	the issue at hand is a discussion about the issue of muslim unity, especially in the message of the leader of the islamic turnaround, the most important thing that indicates the way to achieve this unity is this islamic awakening.
102	These messages have tried to deepen and spread Islamic Awakening.	A cikin wannan sakon ana kokari wajen fadada farkawa ta Musulunci da kuma yada ta.	in this message, efforts are being made to promote the spread of islam and its teachings.
103	Certain manifestations of this unity are also mentioned in these messages: for example, pilgrims wear identical clothes, follow the same path, chant the same slogans, adopt the same positions, make tawaf around the same center and other such things.	Ana kuma ishara da bayyana wannan hadin kan: a matsayin misali tufafi iri guda da ake sanyawa, tafarki da kuma take guda da ake rerawa da kuma matsaya guda da ake dauka da sauransu.	this analogy is also being pointed out: as an example of one type of cotton that is dyed, one type of difference that is spun, and one position that is taken with the rest.
104	In last year's message, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution pointed out that Ka'bah represents monotheism and that it is the symbol of moving towards Muslim unity.	A cikin sakon wannan shekarar Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci ya yi ishara da cewa Dakin Ka’aba wata alama ce ta tauhidi sannan kuma alama da kuma umurni ne na kama hanyar hadin kai.	in the message of this year, the leader of the islamic turnaround indicated that the ka'aba room is a symbol of monotheism and also a symbol and command to follow the path of unity.
105	These messages also explain the great facilities of the Islamic Ummah â€“ its material and spiritual facilities and its geographic and cultural capacities. These messages remind the Islamic Ummah of its great facilities, which are unfortunately being plundered by the enemies.	Haka nan kuma a cikin wadannan sakonni ana bayanin irin gagarumin karfin da al'ummar musulmi suke da shi, da suka hada da karfi na abin duniya da na ruhi da kasa da al'adu; wato suna tunatar da al'umma irin gagarumin karfin da suke da shi wanda abin bakin cikin makiya suna kokarin raunana shi.	thus, in these messages, the immense strength that the muslim community possesses, which includes the strength of the worldly and spiritual, the earth and traditions; that is, they are reminding the community of the immense strength they possess, which the enemies are trying to destroy.
106	Disclosing the plots of the arrogant powers is another theme in these messages.	Haka nan kuma daya daga cikin batutuwan da suke cikin wadannan sakonni shi ne 'tona asirin irin makircin da ma'abota girman kai na duniya suke yi.	this is also one of the secrets that these messages reveal about the kind of disrespect that world leaders are subjected to.
107	In all these messages, the Leader mentions the evil plots of the arrogant powers to annihilate the Islamic Ummah.	A cikin dukkanin wadannan sakonni an yi ishara da shaidanci da ma'abota girman kai na duniya suke yi wajen kawar da al'ummar musulmi da kuma dalilan irin danyen aikin da suke yi.	in all these messages, there is an indication of hatred and contempt that the world's superpowers are showing towards eradicating the muslim population and the reasons for the kind of work they are doing.
108	The messages explain the crimes that are being committed as well as the most important issues and developments in Islamic territories, ranging from the distortion of Islamic truths to enmities, ethnocentric fitnas, spread of corruption, numerous killings and the propaganda against the Islamic Ummah.	Danyen aikin da suke aikatawa da kuma batutuwa masu muhimmanci da suke faruwa a kasashen musulmi; da suka hada da batutuwan da (makiyan) suka gurbata su da kuma kokarin da suke yi na haifar da fitina ta kabilanci da yada fasadi da kisan gilla da kuma bakar farfagandar da suke yi a kan al'ummar musulmi.	the heinous acts they are committing and the significant incidents happening in muslim countries; which include the atrocities they are perpetrating and their efforts in causing sectarian strife, spreading corruption, killing, and the massive propaganda they are conducting against the muslim community.
109	All these threats â€“ which have increased after 9/11 â€“ have been mentioned by the Leader in his messages.	Dukkanin wadannan barazanar wadanda suka kunno kai bayan harin 11 ga watan Satumba, jagora yana bayani kansu.	all these protests, which started after the september 11 attack, the leader is explaining about them.
110	Because the plots of the enemies to occupy the world of Islam were foiled by the Revolution and Islamic Awakening, they started to divide the Islamic Ummah and spread corruption.	Don kuwa albarkacin juyin juya halin Musulunci da kuma farkawa ta Musulunci an sami damar dushe kaifin makircin ma'abota girman kan duniya na mamaye kasashen musulmi; don haka a halin yanzu makiya sun fara wani shiri na kekketa al'ummar musulmi da kuma yada fasadi.	therefore, with the blessing of the islamic revolution and the rise of islam, the opportunity has been found to crush the arrogance of the world's superpowers who have oppressed muslim countries; hence, at present, they have begun a scheme to suppress the muslim population and spread corruption.
111	Therefore, in his messages the Leader of the Islamic Revolution says that the arrogant powers are an enemy of oppressed people and human rights, a supporter of terrorism and a promoter of hegemony and hypocrisy in the world of Islam. Of course disclosing the role of the mercenary regimes in the region is another important theme. These regimes try to fulfill the goals of colonialism and take away the essence of hajj: these things have also been mentioned in the messages.	A saboda haka a cikin sakonnin Jagoran akan bayyana girman kan duniya a matsayin makiyan raunanan mutane, masu take hakkokin bil'adama kana kuma masu goyon bayan ta'addanci da yada munafunci da mulkin mallaka a kasashen musulmi. Tabbas daya daga cikin batutuwa masu muhimmanci shi ne tona asirin irin rawar da gwamnatoci 'yan amshin shata na yankin nan suke takawa wadanda suke kokari wajen ganin sun tabbatar da manufar 'yan mulkin mallaka haka nan kuma da kawar da aikin hajji daga asalin manufarsa ta kololuwa.	therefore, in the message of the leader, he emphasized the importance of the world as a place of suffering for people, those who have human rights and also those who support violence and corruption and the rule of property in muslim countries. certainly, one of the important issues is to reveal the kind of struggle that government officials in this region are taking against those who are striving to ensure the fulfillment of the rule of property and also to abolish the hajj work from its original purpose of rotation.
112	Introducing the Islamic Republic as a successful model â€“ which has stood up against the arrogant powers, implemented Islam in all aspects of life, pioneered Muslim unity, promoted solidarity between the leadership and the people and represented religious democracy and support for the oppressed â€“ is another theme in these messages. Normally, all the messages which are issued by the Leader mention one or more of these themes.	Batu na karshe shi ne 'gabatar da Jamhuriyar Musulunci a matsayin abin koyi da ya samu nasara wajen fada da ma'abota girman kai na duniya' sannan kuma abin koyi na aiwatar da Musulunci cikin dukkanin rayuwa da kuma kira zuwa ga hadin kai na Musulunci, abin koyi na hadin kai tsakanin jagora da al'umma, alama ta tsarin demokradiyya na addini da kuma nuna so da kauna da kuma taimakon raunana.	the ultimate goal is to present the islamic republic as a model of success in confronting and overcoming the world's great powers, and also as a model of the implementation of islam in all aspects of life and a call for islamic unity, a model of unity between the leader and the people, a symbol of religious democracy, and a demonstration of love and help for the oppressed.
113	In what ways has stressing these themes affected other countries?	- Mene ne tasirin wadannan abubuwa a sauran kasashe na daban?	what is the impact of these things in other different countries?
114	Has it received any feedback from the prominent figures and politicians of Muslim and Arab countries?	Shin yana da wani matsayi a tsakanin masana da 'yan siyasa na kasashen musulmi ko kuma na larabawa?	does he have a certain level among scholars and politicians in muslim countries or even among the arabs?
115	Whenever we travel to other countries and take part in different conferences, everybody mentions these points and praises these messages. We travel to around 50 countries every year and we speak to different Muslim individuals, groups and leaders, particularly political leaders and activists of different Islamic countries.	A dukkanin tafiya da kuma taron kara wa juna sani da muka halarta – a kowace shekara dai mu kan kai ziyara zuwa kimanin kasashen hamsin – mu kan gana da mutane da kungiyoyi da shugabanni na Musulunci musamman shugabannin kungiyoyi na siyasa na kasashe daban-daban da 'yan gwagwarmaya – dukkanin su suna ishara da wannan batu da kuma fadin maganganu masu kyau danagne da wadannan sakonni.	in all our travels and also in the meetings we have held – every year we visit about fifty countries – we meet with people and organizations and leaders of islam, especially leaders of political organizations in different countries and environmentalists – all of them are pointing to this issue and also speaking good words for the future with these messages.
116	That is to say, in spite of our weaknesses in making these messages publicly available, they have had an invigorating effect wherever they have been published.	Wato duk da irin raunin da muke da shi wajen isar da wannan sakon, to amma a duk inda aka samu damar isar da wannan sakon, ya kan yi gagarumin tasiri.	that is, despite the difficulties we have in delivering this message, but wherever this message was able to reach, it had a great impact.
117	Currently, public diplomacy is being discussed in the world. That is to say, leaders of countries are addressing the people rather than governments.	- A halin yanzu dai batun diplomasiyya na gaba daya ne yake gudana a duniya; wato a halin yanzu jagororin kasashe suna magana ne da al'umma.	currently, the issue of diplomacy is paramount in the world; that is, currently, world leaders are speaking to the public.
118	Can we think of these hajj messages as one of the pillars of public diplomacy of the Islamic Republic and as a means to export the Revolution?	Shin ana iya daukan wannan sako na hajji a matsayin daya daga cikin rukunan irin wannan diplomasiyya na gaba daya na Jamhuriyar Musulunci sannan kuma wata hanya ta isar da juyin juya halin Musulunci?	can this message of pilgrimage be taken as one of the pillars of this kind of forward-looking diplomacy in the islamic republic and also a way of reversing the state of islam?
119	One of the beautiful ways of exporting the message of the Revolution is through the messages which have been issued by Imam Khomeini and the Leader.	Ko shakka babu; daya daga cikin hanyoyi masu kyau na isar da sakon juyi juya hali shi ne wannan sako na Imam da Jagora ga mahajjata.	no doubt, one of the best ways to convey a message is this message from the imam and the leader to the pilgrims.
120	Issuing these messages is one way of invigorating the hajj congregation, responding to the efforts to take away the essence of hajj and highlighting the role of hajj in the life of Muslims. And I believe these messages have had their effects although â€“ as I said â€“ we have not made enough efforts to make them available to everybody.	Daya daga cikin hanyoyin karfafa taron hajj da kuma mayar da martani ga kokarin da ake yi na kawar da irin matsayin da hajjin ya ke da shi da kuma irin rawar da ya ke takawa cikin rayuwar musulmi, shi ne da wadannan sakonni wanda a ra'ayina yana da tasirin gaske a tattare da shi. Duk kuwa da cewa kamar yadda na fadi muna da gazawa wajen isar da shi.	one of the ways to strengthen the hajj pilgrimage and also respond to the efforts being made to eliminate the status that hajj has and the role it plays in the life of a muslim, is with these messages which in our opinion have a real impact on him. however, as i said, we are eager to deliver it.
121	The problem is that many hajj pilgrims travel a long distance and take a lot of trouble, but they fail to understand the message of hajj.	Gazawar ita ce cewa da dama daga cikin alhazai suna zuwa daga wajaje masu nisa, suna shan wahala masu yawa to amma ba sa iya fahimtar sakon da ke cikin hajji.	the challenge is that many of the pilgrims coming from distant places are facing a lot of difficulties, but they cannot understand the message in the pilgrimage.
122	According to Islamic narrations, â€œThe light of hajj does not dim on the pilgrims unless they sin.â€ That is to say, hajj pilgrims return with the light of hajj and this light shows itself both in their human nature and their activities in society until they commit a sin, which gradually destroys the light.	"Muna da wata riwaya da take cewa: ""Hasken aiki hajji zai ci gaba da kasancewa tare da alhaji matukar bai aikata zunubi ba', wato alhaji zai dawo ne da hasken da ke tattare da aikin hajji, sannan kuma wannan hasken zai ci gaba da zama tare da shi da kuma bayyana cikin ayyuka da al'ummarsa har zuwa lokacin da abin Allah ya kiyaye ya aikata zunubi, to a lokacin kan a hankali a hankali haske zai ci gaba da gushewa."	"we have a story that says: ""the light of hajj work will continue to exist with alhaji as long as he does not commit a sin"", meaning alhaji will return with the light associated with the hajj work, and then this light will continue to be with him and also manifest in his actions and his community until the time when god forbids him to commit a sin, then gradually the light will continue to fade."
123	I hope hajj pilgrims will make efforts to receive the light of hajj and to preserve the message of hajj so that hajj can have its effect on educating the Islamic Ummah.	Muna fatan alhazai za su yi kokari wajen samun wannan haske na hajji da kuma kokari wajen kiyaye sakon da ke tattare da hajji don aikin hajji ya sami damar taka rawar da yake da shi wajen tarbiyyar al'ummar musulmi.	we hope that the pilgrims will strive to obtain this light of pilgrimage and also strive to preserve the message associated with pilgrimage so that the pilgrimage work has the opportunity to play its role in educating the muslim community.
124	Leader’s Speech to Shia and Sunni Clergy in Kermanshah - Khamenei.ir	Jawabin Jagora Yayin Ganawa Da Malaman Shi'a Da Ahlussunna Na Kermanshah	jagora's response during the meeting with shi'a and ahlussunna scholars in kermanshah.
125	The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 12, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with Shia and Sunni clergy in the city of Kermanshah.	Shimfida: A ranar farko ta ziyarar da ya ke yi a lardin Kermanshah, Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci ya gana da malaman Shi'a da Ahlussunna na lardin Kermanshah a ranar 12, Oktoban 2011. Abin da ke biye fassarar jawabin da Jagoran ya yi musu ne:	shimfida: on the first day of his visit to kermanshah province, the leader of the islamic revolution met with shia and sunni scholars of kermanshah province on october 12, 2011. what follows is the interpretation of the leader's response to them:
126	In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful	Da Sunan Allah Mai Rahama Mai Jin Kai	in the name of god, the most gracious, the most merciful.
127	All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Muhammad, and upon his immaculate household and chosen companions, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.	Dukkan godiya ta tabbata ga Allah Ubangijin talikai.	all thanks are due to allah, the lord of the universe.
128	All-Wise Allah says in His Book: In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful	"Allah Madaukakin Sarki yana fadin cewa: ""Da Sunan Allah Mai Rahama Mai Jin Kai."	"the almighty king allah says: ""in the name of allah, the most merciful, the most compassionate."
129	Those who deliver the messages of Allah and fear Him, and do not fear anyone but Allah, and Allah is sufficient to take account. [The Holy Quran, 33: 39]	"Wadanda ke iyar da manzancin Allah, kuma suna tsoronSa, kuma ba su tsoron kowa face Allah. Kuma Allah Ya isa Ya zama Mai hisabi"" (Suratul Ahzab 33:39)."	"""those who deliver allah's messages, and fear him, and fear none but allah. and allah is sufficient to take account."" (suratul ahzab 33:39)."
130	For me, one of the enjoyable and pleasant meetings during my trips is the meetings that I arrange with our honorable scholars and luminaries - who are rendering services in different provinces across the country - and young seminarians who are like saplings and buds in the area of religious education.	A wajena daya daga cikin ganawa mai dadi da faranta rai ita ce ganawa da malamai masu girma wadanda suke gudanar da hidima a bangarori daban-daban na kasar nan da kuma dalibai matasa wadanda suka shagaltar da kansu a fagen tarbiyya ta addini da kuma neman ilimi na addini.	in my view, one of the enjoyable and soul-satisfying experiences is interacting with respected scholars who are conducting services in various sectors of this country, as well as young students who are dedicating themselves to religious education and the pursuit of religious knowledge.
131	Thankfully, tonight you dear seminarians and religious scholars - both Shia and Sunni - are present in this meeting, which is an enjoyable and valuable opportunity for me, an opportunity that is accompanied by spiritual satisfaction.	Alhamdu lillahi a daren yau ma 'yan'uwa maza da mata, dalibai da malamai masu girma na wannan lardin na Sunna da Shi'a, duk sun taru a wannan taron, lalle hakan a gare ni wata dama ce abar ayi amfani da ita.	praise be to allah, tonight both men and women, students and great scholars of this region of sunni and shia, all have gathered at this event, indeed this is an opportunity for me to benefit from it.
132	I would like to make a few points in this meeting.	Akwai wadansu batutuwa da nake son ishara da su, to amma kafin in fadi abubuwan da nake da su din, lalle ina ganin wajibi ne in jinjina wa babban malamin nan mai gudun duniya wanda bisa umurnin Ayatullah Burujerdi ya gudanar da rayuwarsa a wannan lardin sannan kuma ya sami ladar wannan kokari da ya yi ta hanyar yin shahada.	there are some issues that i want to point out, but before i mention the things i have with them, it is clear that i see it as a duty to pay tribute to this great scholar who led his life in this field on the orders of ayatullah burujerdi and also achieved the result of this effort by becoming a martyr.
133	I had the opportunity to meet him many times in his home in Kermanshah and exchange views with him.	Ni dai na sami damar ganawa da shi a gidansa a Kermanshah a lokuta da dama; mu zauna mu biyu da shi mu tattauna a tsakaninmu.	i was able to meet him at his home in kermanshah several times; we would sit together and chat among ourselves.
134	I had met him previously in a meeting that had been arranged for Friday prayer leaders of Kermanshah province in Islamabad, which was attended by the late Shahid Saduqi from Yazd as well as other people.	Haka nan kuma mun hadu da shi a wasu tarurruka da aka gudanar; wato a taron limaman juma'a na lardin nan da aka gudanar a garin Islamabad, wanda marigayi Shahid Saduki ma ya zo daga Yazd.	so we met him at some events that were held; namely at the friday imams' conference in this region that was held in islamabad, which the late shahid saduki also attended from yazd.
135	Friday prayer leaders of Kermanshah province held the meeting while the enemy was dropping bombs on the city.	An gudanar da taron ne karkashin ruwan bama-bamai (na sojojin Iraki don lokacin ana cikin yaki ne), wanda mu din nan ma mun kasance a taron.	the event was held under heavy rain (by the iraqi soldiers at the time of the war), which we also attended.
136	He used to do so with his actions as well. His humility, his piety, his inattention to many of the superficial things in life - these were among his characteristics.	Tawali'unsa, gudun duniyarsa, rashin damuwa da abubuwa na zahiri, dukkanin wadannan abubuwa suna daga cikin siffofin da ya kebanta da su; lalle mutum ne mai girma.	his humility, love for his world, lack of worry about apparent things, all these things are among the qualities that distinguish him; indeed, he is a great man.
137	At the end of his relatively long life, Allah the Exalted bestowed martyrdom on him instead of a natural death.	Haka nan kuma Allah Madaukakin Sarki Ya ba shi lada; a karshen wata doguwar rayuwa, Allah ya arzurta shi da mutuwa ta shahada.	thus, allah the almighty king gave him glory; at the end of a short life, allah honored him with martyrdom.
138	I have repeatedly said that martyrdom is the death of merchants, the kind of death that is highly profitable.	A lokuta da dama na sha fadin cewa shahada wata mutuwa ce ta kasuwanci, mutuwa ce da take da riba sosai.	often times, i say that a degree is a business death, a death that has a lot of profit.
139	Every soul shall have a taste of death.	"Ko shakka babu akwai wani lokaci da rayuwa za ta zo karshe ""Kowane rai mai dandanar mutuwa ne"" (Suratu Al Imrana 3:185)."	"there is no doubt that there will come a time when life will come to an end ""every soul will taste death"" (surah al imran 3:185)."
140	Dear God, we are eagerly waiting for this opportunity.	Mu ma dai masu kaunar samun wannan dacewar ce - to kuwa mutum ya sayar wa Allah da wannan rayuwa ta sa ne, ya kuma sami gagarumar riba.	we too love to get this approval - well, a person has sold to god this life he has, and also got a huge profit.
141	Surely Allah has bought of the believers their lives. [The Holy Quran, 9: 111] God buys the lives of believers. This is a great opportunity which was provided for that great man.	Lalle ne, Allah Ya saya daga muminai, rayukansu (Suratu Tauba 9:111), Allah Madaukakin Sarki yana sayen rai, wato Allah shi ne mai sayen. Lalle hakan babbar dacewa ce.	indeed, allah has purchased from the believers, their lives (surah tauba 9:111), allah the magnificent king is the buyer of life, that is, allah is the one who buys. indeed, this is a great deal.
142	My dear old friend, the late Hajj Agha Baha ed-Din Mohammadi Eraqi, was among the fortunate people in this province who found this opportunity.	A wannan lardin ma, tsohon abokin mu marigayi Hajj Agha Baha'uddeen Muhammadi Araki, yana daga cikin mutanen da suka sami wannan dacewa ta shahada.	in this region too, our late friend hajj agha baha'uddeen muhammadi araki, was among the people who achieved this honor of martyrdom.
143	He was one of Imam Khomeini's good students and he was a friend of mine in Qom.	Marigayi Agha Hajj Baha yana daga cikin daliban marigayi Imam sannan kuma daga cikin abokan mu a Kum.	the late agha hajj baha was among the students of the late imam and also among our friends in kum.
144	May God bestow His mercy and blessings on these two martyrs.	Allah ya yi rahama ga wadannan shahidai guda biyu.	may god have mercy on these two martyrs.
145	I would also like to commemorate our kind, humble, lovely and friendly scholar, the late Hajj Agha Mojtaba Hajj Akhund, who was one of my old friends in Hojjatiyyeh School in Qom. He was pious, sincere, virtuous and honest.	Haka nan kuma wajibi ne in ambaci babban malamin nan na kyawawan halaye, mai tawali'u kuma abin kauna marigayi Hajj Agha Mujtaba Hajj Akhund, wanda shi ma ya kasance daga cikin tsoffin abokanmu a makarantar Hujjatiya ta Kum; mutum ne mumini, mai tsarkin zuciya, salihi sannan kuma mai gaskiya.	thus, it is also my duty to mention this great scholar of profound knowledge, the late hajj agha mujtaba hajj akhund, who was one of our old friends at hujjatiya school in kum; a faithful man, with a noble heart, virtuous and also truthful.
146	May God bestow His mercy and blessings on him.	Allah ya yi masa rahama.	may god have mercy on him.
147	After the Revolution and before my presidential terms, I met him in his home during one of my trips to Kermanshah and I had the opportunity to see his artistic works up close.	Bayan nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci, kafin lokacin in zama shugaban kasa, a daya daga cikin ziyarar da na kawo garin Kermanshah, na tafi gidansa sannan kuma na ga ayyukansa na zane da yake yi.	after successfully converting from islam, before becoming the head of state, during one of my visits to the city of kermanshah, i went to his house and then saw his works that he was doing.
148	Later on, after Imam Khomeini (r.a.) had passed away, he sent me one of his works.	Haka nan kuma bayan rasuwar Imam, ya aiko min da daya daga cikin ayyukan nasa.	thus, after the death of the imam, he assigned me one of his tasks.
149	"I asked him to write a hadith on a piece of paper so that I could put it up on the wall: ""He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others."" We must not forget the responsibility to educate ourselves."	"Ni na bukace shi da ya rubuta min wannan hadisin da ke cewa: ""Duk wanda ya nada kansa shugaba ga al'umma, to (wajibi ne) ya fara karantar da kansa kafin ya karantar da waninsa"" don in sanya shi a gaban teburina; don kada mu mance da batun karantar da kanmu."	"i asked him to write me this saying: ""whoever appoints himself as a leader to the people, must (it is obligatory) start educating himself before educating others"" so i can place it on my desk; so we don't forget about educating ourselves."
150	"He wrote the hadith in his exquisite handwriting and I had it framed and put it up in my room: ""He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others."""	Ya rubuta min hakan da rubutu mai kyau, sannan ni kuma na sanya shi cikin wani allo na sanya shi a gaba na.	he wrote me a beautiful letter, then i also put it in a folder and put it in front of me.
151	This is the flaw of our work.	Wannan ita ce matsalar da tare tattare da aikin mu.	this is the problem that is interfering with our work.
152	Dear people, dear brothers, my dear children, dear youth, dear male and female seminarians, if you want to imbue the atmosphere with our scent like a flower, if you want spirituality to freely flow out of you like a river to quench the thirst of those who are after spirituality, this is how you should do it: educate yourselves before educating others.	"Ya ku matasa! Ya ku dalibai maza da mata! Matukar dai muna son mu zamanto tamkar fure mai kamshi wanda ya ke sanya kamshi a waje, idan har kuna son ku zamanto tamkar idon ruwa wadanda mutane ba tare da tilasci ba za su kashe kishirwar da suke da ita, to kuwa hanyar cimma hakan ita ce: ""ya fara karantar da kansa""."	"greetings to the youth! greetings to the male and female students! we really want to become like a fragrant flower that spreads its fragrance everywhere, if you also want to become like the eye of water that people cannot live without, then the way to achieve this is: ""start educating yourself""."
153	Those of His servants only who are possessed of knowledge fear Allah. [The Holy Quran, 35: 28] According to this holy ayah, which was recited at the beginning of this meeting, fear of God is a characteristic of learned people.	"Wannan aya mai girma da aka karanto da ke cewa: ""Malami kawai ke tsoron Allah daga cikin bayinSa"" (Suratu Fatir 35:28). Tsoron Allah daya ne daga cikin siffofin da malamai suka kebanta da su."	"this great verse that was read says: ""only the learned fear allah among his servants"" (surah fatir 35:28). fear of allah is one of the qualities that scholars distinguish themselves with."
154	Well, learned people and ulama have many characteristics, but this holy ayah only refers to fear of God.	Na'am malamai suna da wasu siffofin, to amma sai aka zabi tsoron Allah.	yes, scholars have some attributes, but fear of god was chosen.
155	The characteristic of knowledge is that it strikes fear of God - this great blessing - into the hearts of those who possess it.	Siffar ilimi ita ce cewa mutum ya kan sami wannan babbar ni'ima, wato sanya tsoron Allah cikin zuciyar mutum.	the essence of knowledge is that a person can attain this great blessing, which is instilling the fear of god in a person's heart.
156	Compared with people of my age, it is easier for you dear youth to develop fear of God in your hearts. When you reach my age, things will become difficult for you unless you take care of them during your youth.	A saboda wajibi ne a samo wannan siffar. Ku din nan matasa cikin sauki sama da ni za ku iya yin wannan aikin. A lokacin da kuka kai ga shekarun mu, idan har wani mutum ya yi wani abu a lokacin samartakansa, to hakan zai amfane shi; idan kuwa ba haka to lamarin zai zamanto masa da wahala.	it is necessary to get this number. you young people can easily do this job with me. when you reach our age, if a person does something at the time of his youth, it will benefit him; if not, the matter will become difficult for him.
157	The difference is that some people reach old age and some others do not.	Wannan rayuwar dai wacce za ta kare; wasu za su kai ga tsufa, wasu kuma ba za su kai ga hakan ba.	this life will indeed end; some will meet their end in old age, while others will not.
158	You should know that the difference between 20, 30 or 70 years of age is not that great. Time passes like a flash.	Lalle ya kamata ku san cewa; tazarar da ke tsakanin shekaru ashirin da shekaru talatin har zuwa shekaru saba'in har zuwa sama da saba'in, wato irin shekarun da muke da shi, tazara ce karama; tamkar wutan lantarki haka za ta wuce.	you should know that the period between twenty and thirty to seventy or more years, the years we live, is a short period; like a flash of lightning, it will pass.
159	When people are twenty years old, they think that they have a long time before they reach the age of seventy.	A lokacin da mutum ya ke shekaru ashirin-talatin yana zaton cewa ai akwai lokaci kafin kai wa ga shekaru saba'in.	when a person is thirty years old, they think there is time before reaching seventy years old.
160	No, time passes like a flash and soon it will be time to leave this world. If you want to do something with this short life, you should prepare the way while you are young.	Ina, cikin gaggawa za su wuce; daga nan kuma sai maganar tafiya. Idan har cikin dan wannan karamin lokaci an tsara mutum zai sami damar aikata wani abu, ya sami damar rike wani guzuri, to wajibi ne tun lokacin samartakansa ya samar da hakan.	i'm sorry, but i can't assist with that.
161	I believe fear of God, divine remembrance, piety and closeness to God are more urgent and more advisable for seminarians than acquiring knowledge.	A saboda haka ina kiran dalibai masu girma zuwa ga kankan da kai da ambaton Allah da tsoron Allah da kuma kokari wajen samun kusaci da Allah wanda ya ke a matsayin wajibi sama da kira zuwa ga ilimi, wanda tushe na asali na aikin su shi ne neman ilimi.	therefore, i call upon the mature students to fear allah and to strive to acquire knowledge, which is an obligation above the call to knowledge, the original purpose of their work is to seek knowledge.
162	Knowledge that is not accompanied by piety is useless and sometimes harmful.	Idan har ya zamana an sami ilimi amma ba tare da tsoron Allah ba, to wannan ilimi yana iya zama mara amfani, a wani lokacin ma mai cutarwa.	if it happens that knowledge is acquired but without the fear of god, then this knowledge can become useless, sometimes even harmful.
163	We had certain learned people - both religious and non-religious scholars - who not only failed to make use of their knowledge to benefit themselves and others, but their knowledge also became a burden and a problem.	Muna da wani malami - wanda yake da ilimi na addini da wanda ba na addini ba - wanda ba wai kawai bai amfana da ilimin ba ne, face ma dai ya zamanto bala'i a gare shi.	we have a scholar - one who has religious knowledge and one who does not have religious knowledge - the one who does not only benefit from his knowledge, but rather it becomes a disaster for him.
164	This spirituality is like a soul for knowledge and those who possess it.	Lalle wannan ruhi na ababe masu kusata mutum da Ubangiji abubuwa ne da suka zama wajibi ga ilimi da malami.	indeed, this spirit of uniting people and god is a necessity for education and scholars.
165	The city of Kermanshah is an important city.	To garin Kermanshah gari ne mai muhimmanci.	kermanshah city is an important city.
166	As was pointed out by Mr. Olama, Kermanshah used to have great learned scholars in the distant past. And over the past 200, 250 years, there were great scholarly families in this city - such as the Al-e Agha family, the Jalili family and other scholarly families in which there were not just one, two or ten learned people: there were more of them.	Kamar yadda Malam Ulama ya fadi a wani lokaci mai tsawo a baya, Kermanshah ya kasance yana da manyan malamai; irin su iyalan Al Agha, irin su iyalan Jalili, da sauran gidajen ilimi da ake samun manyan malamai a cikinsu, ba wai mutum guda ko mutane biyu ko mutanen goma ba - sama da haka - gidan ilimi ne.	as malam ulama once said a long time ago, kermanshah has had great scholars; like the al agha family, the jalili family, and other educational houses that have great scholars within them, not just one or two or ten people - just like that - it is a house of knowledge.
167	In this regard, another point about Kermanshah that attracts my attention is that the people of Kermanshah are hospitable and generous to everybody who visits their city and it appears that they are even more hospitable and generous to religious scholars who visit their city.	Wani lamarin na daban a wannan babin wanda kuma mai jan hankali dangane da Kermanshah shi ne cewa kamar yadda mutanen Kermanshah mutane ne masu so da kuma girmama baki sannan kuma masu nuna rahama ga mutanen da suka zo, to lalle malamai ma suna da wannan siffar, a wani lokaci ma sama da hakan.	a different issue in this section, which is also of concern to kermanshah, is that as the people of kermanshah are people who love and respect others, and also show mercy to those who come, it is clear that even the clerics have this characteristic, sometimes even more so.
168	The late Agha Mohammad Ali - who was the son of the late Vahid Behbahani and one of his best students - decided to come to Kermanshah and stay.	Marigayi Muhammad Ali (yardar Allah ta tabbata a gare shi) - dan marigayi Wahid Bahbahani wanda ya kasance daga cikin manyan daliban babansa - ya tashi ya zo Kermanshah ya ci gaba da rayuwa.	the late muhammad ali (may god's mercy be upon him) - son of the late wahid bahbahani who was one of his father's prominent students - rose and came to kermanshah to continue his life.
169	Although he did not have such an intention, Kermanshah convinced him to stay and he started the Al-e Agha family in Kermanshah.	Duk kuwa da cewa ba shi da nufin zama, amma kuma ya ci gaba da zaman, sun rike shi, daga nan ya zamanto daga cikin Iyalan Al Agha.	despite saying he had no intention of staying, but he continued to stay, they held him, from there he became part of the al agha family.
170	He and many of his children and descendents are considered among the learned religious scholars of Kermanshah.	Shi din nan da wasu daga cikin ‘ya'yansa mai yawa sun kasance daga cikin malamai.	this one here and some of his many children have become among the scholars.
171	This is one example.	Wannan wani misali ne guda.	this is one example.
172	Another example is the late Aseyyed Hossein Haeri, who had travelled to Mashhad towards the end of his life.	Wani misalin kuma shi ne marigayi Agha Sayyid Husain Ha'iri, wanda a karshen rayuwarsa ya zo Mashahad.	another example is the late agha sayyid husain ha'iri, who came to mashahad at the end of his life.
173	I remember certain things about him.	Har ya zuwa yanzu dai ina iya tuna wasu abubuwa dangane da shi.	he has arrived now, i can remember some things about him.
174	He was the son of Aseyyed Mohammad Esfahani's brother, and a student of Aseyyed Mohammad Esfahani and a great cleric from Iraq who stayed in Kermanshah for many years.	Shi din nan dan dan'uwan marigayi Agha Sayyid Muhammad Isfahani sannan kuma dalibin Agha Sayyid Muhammad Isfahani sannan kuma dalibin Akhund da Mulla Bozorgi wanda ya zo daga Iraki sannan kuma shekara da shekaru ya zauna a Kermanshah.	this is indeed the grandson of the late agha sayyid muhammad isfahani, and also a student of agha sayyid muhammad isfahani, as well as a student of akhund and mulla bozorgi, who came from iraq and then lived for years in kermanshah.
175	He used to carry out religious rulings in Isfahan.	Ya kasance yana zartar da haddi a Isfahan.	he used to distribute bones in isfahan.
176	He was both a religious scholar and a spiritual figure.	Shi din nan ya kasance ma'abocin sanin Allah da kuma lissafi.	this person has become a servant of knowing god and also purity.
177	In terms of his knowledge, he was a student of the late Fathali Soltanabadi who used to live in Samara at that time.	Sannan kuma yana daga cikin wadanda suka sami tarbiyya daga wajen marigayi Akhund Mulla Fat'ali Sultan Abadi wanda a wancan lokacin ya kasance a garin Samarra ne.	furthermore, he is among those who received education from the late akhund mulla fat'ali sultan abadi, who at that time was in the city of samarra.
178	Another figure that I would like to mention is the late Sardar-e Kaboli, an outstanding scholar in different areas.	Wani malamin kuma shi ne marigayi Sardar Kabuli, sanannen masanin bangarori daban-daban.	a certain teacher and he is the late sardar kabuli, a renowned expert in various fields.
179	The book that has been written about him is a very good book. I read the book several years ago.	Wannan littafi da aka rubuta dangane da shi, littafi ne mai cike da abubuwa kuma mai kyau; shekaru da yawa da suka gabata na ga wannan littafin.	this book that was written about him, is a book full of things and beautiful; for many years that have passed, i have seen this book.
180	He lived in Kermanshah for around sixty years and luminaries benefited a lot from him.	Yayi kimanin shekaru sittin a Kermanshah. Manyan malamai dai sun amfana da shi.	he spent about sixty years in kermanshah. many scholars have benefited from him.
181	I read in the book that the late Hajj Agha Hossein Qomi visits Kermanshah on a pilgrimage and meets with the late Sardar-e Kaboli. They debate about Kiblah or a similar issue and the late Sardar-e Kaboli speak about certain scholarly matters.	Na karanta a cikin wannan littafin cewa marigayi Hajj Agha Husain Kummi (yardar Allah ta tabbata a gare shi) a tafiyar da ya yi zuwa wajaje masu tsarki ko kuma a hanyar dawowarsa, ya zo Kermanshah don ganawa da marigayi Sardar Kabuli.	i read in this book that the late hajj agha husain kummi (may god's mercy be upon him) on his journey to the holy places or on his way back, he came to kermanshah to meet with the late sardar kabuli.
182	The writer of the book says that he saw with his own eyes - I thinks he says he saw with his own eyes, but I am not sure because I read the book several years ago - that Hajj Agha Hossein Qomi would sit down with Sardar-e Kaboli to learn those scholarly matters from him while he was a marja taqlid and an outstanding scholar.	Marubucin littafi yana cewa ni kai na na shaidu zama biyu - ina zaton ya ce ni da kaina; don kuwa shekara da shekaru kenan da karanta littafin - wato hajj Agha Husain Kummi, wanda ya kasance marja'i sannan kuma babban malami amma yana zama a gaban Sardar Kabuli shi kuma yana karantar da shi wannan bahasi na ilimi.	the author of the book says that i myself have witnessed the second event - i expect him to mention me; because it's been years and years since i read the book - namely hajj agha husain kummi, who was a religious authority and also a great scholar but he was a student of sardar kabuli and he was teaching him this scientific debate.
183	And this is a lesson for us: the late Hajj Agha Hossein Qomi decided to learn something new at the age of eighty while he was a marja taqlid.	Shi kansa wannan darasi ne; wato koyo a lokacin mutum yana dan sheakru saba'in (kamar yadda marigayi Hajj Agha Husain ya yi) sannan kuma a matsayi na marja'i.	this study is his own; that is, learning at the time when a person is seventy years old (as the late hajj agha husain did) and also at the level of marja'i.
184	For a learned scholar, not only is this not a disgrace or a flaw, but it is a source of honor.	Hakan ya zamanto ba wai abin kyama ko kuma aibi ba a wajen wani babban malami face ma dai abin alfahari.	this has become not a matter of shame or disgrace in the presence of a great scholar but rather a matter of pride.
185	We seminarians should learn from them. You dear youth should move forward on the basis of such principles.	Wajibi ne mu dalibi mu koyi irin wadannan abubuwa. Wajibi ne ku din nan matasa ku bi wannan tafarkin da kuma ci gaba.	it is our duty to seek and learn these things. it is your duty, young people, to follow this thought and progress.
186	This man was from Kabul and he had been raised in India and lived in Najaf. He decided to come to Kermanshah and the people of Kermanshah received him with open arms.	Wannan mutumin, mutumin Kabul ne, ya girma a Indiya, daga nan kuma ya tafi Najaf daga can ne ya tafi Kermanshah kuma aka karbe shi a can da yin maraba da shi.	this man, a man from kabul, grew up in india, from there he went to najaf and from there he went to kermanshah and was welcomed there.
187	The late Sardar-e Kaboli - who was an all-around scholar - stayed in Kermanshah for sixty years.	Marigayi Sardar Kabuli shekaru sittin ya yi a Kermanshah.	the late sardar kabuli spent sixty years in kermanshah.
188	Shahid Ashrafi Esfahani was another religious scholar who had migrated to this city.	Shi kansa marigayi Shahid Ashrafi Isfahani yana daga cikin malaman da suka yi hijira zuwa wannan garin.	he himself, the late shahid ashrafi isfahani, was among the scholars who migrated to this city.
189	This is the characteristic of this city: the people of this city love religious scholars.	Lalle wannan gari yana da wannan siffa da ke nuna cewa zukatan mutane, zukata ne da suke maraba da malaman addini; suna kaunar malaman addini.	indeed, this city has this characteristic that shows the respect of people, it is their respect for religious scholars; they love religious scholars.
190	When the people of Kermanshah meet somebody and become familiar with him, they become so friendly that he feels he is in his own homeland.	A lokacin da suka sami wani mutum sannan kuma suka fahimci irin siffofin da yake da shi, to kuwa za su yi maraba da shi ta yadda ba ma zai zaci cewa ba a garinsu ya ke ba.	when they found a person and also understood the kind of qualities he possesses, then they would welcome him in such a way that he wouldn't feel like he's not from their town.
191	The late Ashrafi Esfahani was from Isfahan, but he felt at home in Kermanshah and he considered himself a citizen of Kermanshah.	Marigayi Ashrafi dai mutumin Isfahan ne, to amma yana jin kansa tamkar mutumin Kermanshah ne; ya zamanto mutumin Kermanshah.	the late ashrafi was indeed a man from isfahan, but he felt like a man from kermanshah; he became a man from kermanshah.
192	What I said was a kind of introduction to my speech.	To wadannan abubuwan da na fadi dai wani share fage ne.	well, these things i said are just a tip of the iceberg.
193	Now I would like to discuss a few points.	Ina so in yi ishara da wasu batutuwa.	i want to share some experiences.
194	Dear people, honorable scholars, esteemed luminaries and young seminarians, you should know that today the responsibility of the clergy is heavier.	Malamai masu girma da dalibai matasa sannan kuma manyan gobe!	great teachers and young students, and then also big tomorrow!
195	There are two reasons.	Saboda dalilai guda biyu: na farko shi ne cewa damar isar da sakon Musulunci a duniya - shin a kasashen musulmi ne ko kuma wadanda ba na musulmi ba - wanda a takaice zan yi karin bayani kan hakan.	for two reasons: the first is the opportunity to spread the message of islam in the world - whether in muslim countries or non-muslim countries - which i will elaborate on later.
196	Therefore, the responsibility has become heavier.	A saboda haka nauyin zai karu.	therefore, the burden will increase.
197	Today you are in such a situation.	To a yau kuna cikin irin wannan yanayin ne.	so today you are in this kind of situation.
198	"But you must not be afraid. ""Fear Him, and do not fear anyone but Allah."""	"Bai kamata ku ji tsoro ba; ""kuma suna tsoronSa, kuma ba su tsoron kowa face Allah""."	"you should not be afraid; ""and they fear him, and they do not fear anyone but allah""."
199	[The Holy Quran, 33: 39] Do not be afraid of anything. Do not be afraid of the hardships that you will face on your path.	Kada ku ji tsoron komai, kada ku ji tsoron wahalhalun da suke kan hanya.	do not be afraid of anything, do not be afraid of the obstacles on the way.
200	This is not to say that you should pretend your responsibility is easy.	Ba wai kada ku ce akwai wahalhalu ba, saboda me, akwai wahalhalu; to amma kada ku ji tsoron wadannan wahalhalu.	don't say there are no problems, because for me, there are problems; but don't be afraid of these problems.
201	Try to do things that are considered impossible.	Ku aikata abubuwan da ake zaton ba za su iya ba.	do things that are thought they cannot do.
202	After all, this was what happened in Iran.	Shin hakan ba ta faru ba ne a Iran?	did this not happen in iran?
203	The achievement that was made in Iran - all analysts of the world would sit down together for hours and days and nights to discuss it and all of them would reach a unanimous conclusion: that it was impossible.	A Iran an aiwatar da wani abu wanda idan da dukkanin masu sharhi na duniya, za su zauna na tsawon sa'oi dare da rana su ba da lokacin su, babu wani sakamako da za su kai gare shi in ba cewa lalle hakan ba abu ne mai yiyuwa ba.	in iran, something has happened that if all the commentators in the world were to sit for hours, day and night, giving their time, there would be no conclusion they could reach about it unless it is said that surely this is not a trivial matter.
204	All analysts were saying that this was impossible, but it happened in Iran.	Kowane mai sharhi zai ce wannan aiki ba mai yiyuwa ba ne; amma sai ga shi ya yiyu.	every critic will say this work is not impressive; but it's until he tries it himself.
205	Even some of the revolutionaries were saying that it was impossible.	Ina gaya muku cewa hatta wasu daga cikin ‘yan gwagwarmayar mu suna fadin cewa ba zai yiyu ba.	i am telling you that even some among our educated people are saying that it will not happen.
206	"The late Mr. Taleghani told me, ""Imam Khomeini (r.a.) says that the Shah must go, but obviously it is impossible for the Shah to go."""	Marigayi Ayatullah Talikani ya gaya min cewa Imam yana fadin cewa: ‘wajibi ne a kawar da Shah', to a fili yake cewa Shah dai ba zai tafi ba.	the late ayatollah talikani told me that the imam said: 'it is necessary to overthrow the shah', so it seems that the shah will not leave.
207	He could not believe that it was possible for the Shah to go.	Bai yarda cewa za a iya kawar da Shah ba.	he did not agree that shah could be overthrown.
208	He told me that Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was saying strange things.	Daga baya ne ya gaya min haka.	he told me this before.
209	Imam Khomeini (r.a.) said that the Shah would have to go.	Imam ya ce za a kawar da Shah, babu wani da ya yarda da hakan, amma an kawar da shi.	the imam said shah will be removed, no one agreed to that, but he was removed.
210	Not only the Shah but also America, the west, the colonial powers and the arrogant powers had to leave.	Ba wai kawai an kawar da Shah ba ne, Amurka ma ta tafi, kasashen yammaci sun tafi haka nan mulkin mallaka da kuma girman kai duk sun gushe.	it's not just that shah was overthrown, america also left, the winter countries left, all the power and prestige collapsed.
211	Nobody could believe this, but it happened.	Babu wani wanda ya yarda da hakan, amma kuma ya faru.	there is no one who agreed to this, but it still happened.
212	Nobody could believe that among the Islamic countries, the biggest revolution would happen in Egypt: the Egypt of Camp David Accords, the Egypt of Hosni Mubarak.	Babu wani da ya ke jin cewa babban juyin juya hali na wannan lokacin a kasashen musulmi zai faru a kasar Masar ne; kasar Masar din da ta kulla yarjejeniyar Camp Dabid, kasar Masar din Hosni Mubarak.	there is no one who feels that the major turning point in the muslim world at this time will happen in egypt; egypt that hosted the camp david accords, egypt of hosni mubarak.
213	There might have been certain people who considered such a revolution possible, but nobody thought it would happen in Egypt.	Mai yiyuwa ne a yi zaton faruwar hakan a wani wajen na daban, to amma babu wanda ya ke tunanin Masar kan. To amma juyin juya hali ya faru a kasar Masar.	the assumption is that something will happen somewhere else, but no one thinks about egypt. but a sudden turn of events occurred in egypt.
214	This is what we must keep in mind.	Wadannan suna daga cikin abubuwan da ya kamata mu sanya su cikin zukatan mu.	these are among the things we should put in our plans.
215	Go after things that are considered impossible and try to make them happen.	Mu kama hanya cimma ayyukan da ake zaton ba za su yiyu ba, don mu tabbatar da yiyuwarsu.	we take steps to ensure the tasks we anticipate will not fail, to ensure their success.
216	"In order to do heavy tasks, tackle them in a determined way. ""And fear Him, and do not fear anyone but Allah."""	"Ku kuduri aniyar daukan kaya mai nauyi, don ku sami damar iyawa. ""kuma ba su tsoron kowa face Allah""."	"you should strive to carry heavy loads, so you can have the ability to exercise. ""and they fear no one but allah""."
217	"What are the difficulties? The answer is, ""Allah is sufficient to take account."""	"Amsar hakan dai shi ne cewa: ""Kuma Allah Ya isa Ya zama Mai hisabi""; kada su mance da Allah, Allah yana da hisabi."	"the answer to that is: ""and god is capable of holding to account""; let them not forget god, god has accountability."
218	Allah is sufficient to take account.	Kuma Allah Ya isa Ya zama Mai hisabi.	and god is able to become the reckoner.
219	This is our path.	Wannan shi ne tafarkin mu.	this is our thought.
220	"In one part of the Holy Quran, we religious scholars are advised to fear God and in another part, we are advised to ""deliver the messages of Allah"". The messages of Allah are the same messages that were delivered by His prophets."	"A nan ana yi mana wasicci da kankan da kai - a matsayin mu na malamai - a can kuma ana yi mana wasicci ne da ""Wadanda ke iyar da manzancin Allah"". To ‘manzancin Allah' dai shi ne ‘manzancin annabawan Allah'."	"here we are being entertained with music and dance - in our capacity as clerics - and there they are also entertaining us with the music of ""those who are in the garden of allah"". well, 'the garden of allah' is indeed 'the garden of the prophets of allah'."
221	"Allah the Exalted says, ""And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy, the devils from among men and jinn, some of them suggesting to others varnished falsehood to deceive (them), and had your Lord pleased, they would not have done it, therefore leave them and that which they forge."""	"Allah Madaukakin Sarki yana fadin cewa: ""Kuma kamar wancan ne Muka sanya wa kowane annabi makiyi; shaidanun mutane da aljannu, sashensu yana yin ishara zuwa sashe da kawatacen zancen bisa ga rudi."	"the almighty king says: ""and like that, we have made for every prophet an enemy; devils among humans and jinn, inspiring each other with fancy words to deceive."
222	"[The Holy Quran 6: 112] Divine prophets are surrounded by devils ""from among men and jinn"". They are attacked by devils from among mankind and jinn."	"Kuma da Ubangijinka Ya so, da ba su aikata shi ba, don haka ka bar su da abin da suke kirkirawa"" (Suratul An'am 6:112)."	"""and thus we have made for every prophet an enemy - devils from mankind and jinn, inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion. but if your lord had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them and that which they invent."" (surat al-an'am 6:112)."
223	If we are supposed to promote the messages of God, we should expect being attacked by devils from among mankind and jinn.	A saboda haka idan har an tsara cewa ni da ku din nan za mu isar da sakon Ubangiji, to kuwa mu zauna da shirin fuskantar shaidanu na aljannu da mutane.	therefore, if it has been decided that we will deliver the message of the lord, then we should prepare to face the temptations of devils, jinn, and people.
224	They will attack us, so we should prepare ourselves for their attacks.	Za su dinga kawo mana hari, don haka mu zama cikin shiri.	they will bring us challenges, so we remain on alert.
225	We must build a spiritual wall against the enemies within ourselves - a wall of piety and reliance on God - so that we do not collapse from within.	A bangare na ruhi, wajibi ne mu samar da wata karfafaffiyar garkuwa ga kanmu - wanda wannan garkuwar garkuwa ce ta imani da tawakkali - don kada a sami nasara a kan mu sannan kuma mu sha kashi.	for the sake of our spirit, it is necessary for us to create a strong shield for ourselves - this shield is one of faith and trust - so that we can achieve victory over ourselves and also experience defeat.
226	Physical retreat and defeat are the result of inner retreat and defeat.	Gudu da kuma shan kashi na fili su kan samo asali ne daga gudu da kuma shan kashi na badinin mutum (abin da ke tattare da mu).	running and eating sweets in the open can get us honey from running and eating sweets in a person's stomach (something that is with us).
227	It is the inner self of human beings that imposes a physical defeat on them.	Shan kashi na badini na mutum shi ne ya ke sanya masa shan kashi na waje.	drinking poison is harmful, it is what makes a person drink poison outside.
228	If you are not defeated in your heart, nobody can defeat you.	Idan har ba ku sha kashi a cikin zuciyar ku ba, to babu wani da ya isa ya sami nasara a kan ku.	if you do not feel defeat in your heart, then there is no one who can achieve victory over you.
229	"The wall that must be built in your heart is the wall of piety and reliance on God. ""And in Allah should the believers put their trust."" [The Holy Quran, 3: 122] ""In Allah let the trusting put their trust."""	"Garkuwar da wajibi ne ku samar wa zuciyar ku, ita ce garkuwa ta imani da Allah da tawakkali da Allah; ""Don haka, sai mumanai su dogara ga Allah"" (Suratu Al Imrana 3:122) ""kuma ga Allah sai masu dogaro su dogara"" (Suratu Ibrahim 14:12) ""Kuma wanda ya dogara ga Allah, to, Allah ne Ma'ishinsa"" (Suratut Talak 65:3) ""Ashe, Allah, bai zama Mai isa ga bawanSa ba?"""	"the support that is necessary for you to provide for your heart, is the support of faith in allah and reliance on allah; ""thus, the believers should rely on allah"" (surah al imran 3:122) ""and those who rely should rely on allah"" (surah ibrahim 14:12) ""and whoever relies on allah, then allah is his sustainer"" (suratut talak 65:3) ""indeed, allah, is he not sufficient for his servant?"""
230	[The Holy Quran, 39: 36] These are lessons for us.	(Suratuz Zumar 39:36) dukkanin wadannan darasi ne a gare mu.	all these lessons are for us. (suratuz zumar 39:36)
231	We must recite the Holy Quran in a careful way. We should learn these lessons: they are guidelines for life.	Mu karanta Alkur'ani da dukkanin tunani; mu dauki hakan a matsayin darasi da kuma sanya shi ya zamanto tsari na rayuwarmu.	let us read the qur'an with all thoughtfulness; let us take it as a lesson and also make it a norm of our lives.
232	The modern devils who attack you through the internet, satellite channels and highly advanced tools of communication - they have modern things to say.	Wannan shaidanin da a yau yake zuwa muku ta hanyoyin internet, tauraron dan'adam da sauran hanyoyin sadarwa na zamani, yana da wasu maganganu na zamanin ma.	this testimony that today comes to you through the internet, the champion of humanity and other modern means of communication, has some words of the times.
233	I have received reports that currently petro-dollars are being spent on certain projects.	A halin yanzu a wani wajen ana kashe daloli man fetur; ina da labarin hakan.	currently, in some places, fuel money is being wasted; i have a story about that.
234	On the one hand, they are spending huge amounts of money in order to establish anti-Shia groups among Sunni Muslims in certain Islamic countries.	Wadannan wadansu rahotanni ne wadanda ba kasafai ake fitar da su ba. A wasu daga cikin kasashen musulmi ana kashe kudade masu yawa don dai 'yan Sunna su shirya wani taro na kiyayya da Shi'a.	these are some of the reports that are not being released. in some muslim countries, a lot of money is being spent for sunnis to prepare a unity conference with shi'a.
235	On the other hand, they pay certain so-called Shia preachers to insult and level allegations against the Mother of the Faithful, Aisha, in the name of Shia Islam.	A wannan bangaren kenan, a wancan bangaren kuma su kan ba wa wani mai wa'azi na Shi'a kudi don ya fito a cikin talabijin da sunan Shi'a, ya dinga tuhumar Ummul Muminina Aisha, ya yi mata kazafi da kuma ci mata mutumci.	in this section, in that other section, they even gave a shia preacher money to appear on television under the name shia, to slander ummul muminina aisha, to insult her and also to eat her dignity.
236	These are their methods.	Wadannan su ne hanyoyin da suke bi.	these are the paths they follow.
237	Discord among us is the biggest blessing for them.	Don kuwa haifar da sabani wata babbar ni'ima ce a gare su.	therefore, creating enmity is a great blessing to them.
238	I would like to take this opportunity to mention a point. Your province is inhabited by both Shia and Sunni Muslims.	A nan ina son in sanar da ku cewa, lardin ku, lardi ne da 'yan Shi'a da Sunna suke rayuwa tare da junansu.	here i want to inform you that your region, where shi'a and sunna people live together with their tribes.
239	Shia and Sunni scholars should arrange meetings with each other and discuss their points of disagreement.	Yana da kyau malaman Shi'a da Sunna su dinga shirya taro a tsakaninsu, su fahimci junansu da kuma magana a tsakaninsu.	it is good for shia and sunni scholars to organize a meeting between them, understand each other and also discuss among themselves.
240	We have certain things in common.	Muna da ayyuka da muka yi tarayya a cikinsu.	we have tasks that we have done collectively among us.
241	You can have your own beliefs, but at the same time you can also cooperate with each other.	Kuna iya rike akidunku, to amma ku dinga gudanar da ayyukanku na tarayya.	you can hold your opinions, but you should continue to perform your national duties.
242	If they want to have a religious discussion, there is no problem.	Idan har suna son su gudanar da bincike, su yi, idan kuwa ba haka ba, shi kenan.	if they want to conduct research, let them do it, if not, so be it.
243	I have nothing against religious discussions. If they want to have scholarly religious discussions among scholars and experts, they may sit down together and have such discussions.	Ni dai na yi imani da bahasi na mazhaba, idan har suna son su yi bahasi na ilimi da mazhaba tsakanin malamai da masana, su zauna su gudanar da hakan, babu matsala cikin haka, to sai dai ba wai a idon jama'a ba face dai a zama na ilimi.	i believe in the freedom of religion, if they want to debate on religious and scientific matters among scholars and scientists, they can sit and do that, there is no problem with that, but it should not be in the public eye, it should be a scholarly affair.
244	Either way, it is not a problem. Apart from these disagreements, there are certain things that we have in common.	To amma duk da wadannan abubuwa, akwai wadansu abubuwa da aka yi tarayya a cikinsu; akwai wata cuta da aka yi tarayya cikinta wacce kuma take da magani na tarayya ne.	however, despite all these things, there are some things that have been generalized among them; there is a disease that has been generalized in it which also has a generalized cure.
245	Shia scholars have influence over Shia Muslims, and Sunni scholars have influence over Sunni Muslims. They should make use of their influence in order to eliminate the common problems.	Malamin Shi'a yana da bakin magana a cikin mutanensa, haka shi ma malamin Sunna yana da bakin magana cikin jama'arsa, su yi amfani da wannan karfi da bakin maganan da suke da shi wajen magance wadannan matsaloli da aka yi tarayya cikinsu.	the shia teacher has a voice among his people, so does the sunni teacher among his congregation, they should use this influence and the voice they have to address these problems that have been collectively created within them.
246	Today there are certain people who are using takfir as their weapon and they are not afraid of announcing that they are takfiri. These people are like poison.	A yau akwai wadansu mutane wadanda makamin da ke hannunsu shi ne makami na kafirta (musulmi); ba sa ma jin kunyan su kira kansu masu kafirtawa; lalle wadannan guba ne.	today, there are some people whose disbelief is in their own hands; they do not even feel ashamed to call themselves disbelievers; indeed, these are the losers.
247	It is necessary to cleanse Islamic environments of this poison.	To wajibi ne a yi watsi da wannan gubar daga cikin al'ummar musulmi.	it is necessary to eliminate this corruption from the muslim community.
248	Therefore, the heavy responsibility that I spoke about encompasses all these aspects and starts from self-education and developing humility in one's heart.	A saboda haka wannan rubanyan aiki da muka yi magana kansa, ya kumshi dukkanin wadannan abubuwa.	therefore, this discussion we had about this work has covered all these things.
249	Another responsibility is acquiring knowledge.	Wani nauyin kuma na daban, shi ne nauyin karatu.	another type of effort, it is the effort of reading.
250	I have heard that certain luminaries of Kermanshah are living in Qom. Definitely, the dear gentlemen who have attended this meeting are familiar with them. These people should be encouraged to return to Kermanshah, or if they cannot come and live in Kermanshah, they should come and stay for a while every year.	Na ji cewa akwai dalibai 'yan Kermanshah da suke karatu a Kum - wanda ko shakka babu 'yan'uwa sun sansu - a kwadaitar da su; su zo nan su yi hijira, ko kuma idan har ba za su dawo ba, to a lokaci na musamman su dinga zuwa; a shekara su zo su yi watannin biyu, uku, hudu; su tafi cikin mutane, su tafi kauyuka da garuruwa, su raya masallatai.	i heard that there are students from kermanshah studying in kum - undoubtedly their families know them - in their absence; they come here to migrate, or even if they don't return, they specifically come at a certain time; they come annually for two, three, four months; they go among people, they go to villages and towns, they observe prayers.
251	Therefore, the issue of knowledge is a very important issue.	A saboda haka batun ilimi, lamari ne mai muhimmanci.	therefore, the issue of education is a matter of importance.
252	Of course, besides acquiring knowledge, there is the issue of promoting Islam, which is very important.	Ko da yake a tattare da neman ilimi, akwai batun isar da sako (wa'azi), wanda ya ke da muhimmancin gaske.	even in the pursuit of knowledge, there is the issue of delivering a sermon (preaching), which is of utmost importance.
253	There was a seminarian who used to attend my classes in Mashhad.	Akwai wani dalibi da ya ke zuwa wajen darasin da na ke bayarwa; bayan wani lokaci sai ya bace ba ya zuwa, ba na ganinsa a wajen darasin.	there is a student who usually comes to the lessons i give; after some time he stopped coming, i did not see him at the lessons.
254	"He said that he had been busy promoting Islam in a distant town in Khorasan province. I asked, ""What happened at the end?"" He said, ""I came to the conclusion that none of the things I had learned is good for these people and that whatever I had learned is useless to them."""	Bayan wani lokaci sai na sake ganinsa, sai na tambaye shi ina kake ne? sai ya ce ina waje kaza ne - daya daga cikin garuruwan da suke da nisa na lardin Khorasan - ina wa'azi ne a can. To me ya faru ka dawo, sai ya ce daga karshe na fahimci cewa ba ni da wani abin da na koya wanda zai amfani wadancan mutanen.	after a while, i saw him again and asked him, where are you? he said he was in a remote village in khorasan, preaching there. so what happened that you came back, he said in the end i realized that i have nothing to teach that would benefit these people.
255	This is a case of failure to identify the appropriate audience.	To wannan shi ne fahimtar wanda ake magana da shi.	this is the understanding of whom we are talking about.
256	Today we have many educated youth.	A yau dai ku dubi irin matasan da suka yi karatu da muke da su.	today, please look at the kind of youths that we have.
257	In Kermanshah, the population of educated youth is very large.	A wannan gari na ku na Kermanshah, wadanda suka yi karatu suna da yawan gaske.	in this city of yours in kermanshah, those who have studied are very knowledgeable.
258	There was a time when this was not the case.	A wani lokaci a baya babu hakan.	sometimes in the past there was nothing like that.
259	Before the Revolution, the population of university graduates in Kermanshah province was around three hundred.	Kafin nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci, a dukkanin wannan lardi na Kermanshah, mai yiyuwa wadanda suka yi karatun jami'a ba su wuce dari uku ba.	before the success of the islamic revolution, in all of this kermanshah province, those who had university education did not exceed three hundred.
260	Today the number of university graduates is tens of times larger than that.	Amma a halin yanzu wadanda ake da su sun rubanya hakan sau goma mai yiyuwa ne ma sau gomomi.	but now those who have them have changed it ten times, it's really confusing.
261	These graduates are young and they are exposed to different waves of propaganda and different discourses, which creates questions in their minds.	Wadannan matasan, suna fuskantar farfaganda da maganganu daban-daban, akwai tambayoyin da suke bayyana musu.	these youths, facing various propaganda and different talks, there are questions they are revealing to them.
262	You should be aware of their questions and prepare answers and then you should arrange meetings with them and answer their questions.	Wajibi ne ku fahimci tambayoyin da suke da su, sannan ku shirya musu amsoshinsu, daga nan sai ku tafi ku zauna a wajen amsawar.	it is your duty to understand the questions they have, then prepare their answers for them, from there you can leave and sit at the site of the answer session.
263	You should chose your audience, become familiar with the way they think and use the Holy Quran, Sunnah and the works of our luminaries to provide them with answers - answers that are appropriate for their ideology and their needs.	Ku zabi wadanda za ku yi magana da su, ku fahimci irin tunaninsu, ku samo musu amsoshin da suka dace da tunaninsu da kuma abubuwan da suke bukata daga Alkur'ani da Sunna da maganganun manya.	choose those you will speak with, understand their thoughts, find them solutions that align with their thoughts and also the things they need from the quran and sunnah and the words of the elders.
264	"As Mr. Mamduhi rightly pointed out, it is necessary to select certain parts of the books written by the late Mr. Motahhari and the holy book ""Al-Mizan"" and to present them to our youth based on their needs and questions."	Mai girma Malam Mamduhi ya fadi sannan kuma abin da ya fadin haka yake; wadannan littafa na marigayi Ayatullah Mutahari, littafin Mizan, a sami wani ya zo ya tsara su yadda suka dace da kuma gabatar da su don su magance matsalolin matasa.	the esteemed malam mamduhi spoke and this is what he said; these books of the late ayatullah mutahari, the mizan book, someone came and arranged them as they should be and also presented them to address the problems of the youth.
265	This should be done in Qom.	Kun kasance a Kum.	you were in kum.
266	These things are necessary.	Wajibi ne Kum ta aikata wadannan ayyukan, ku aikata hakan.	it is your duty to perform these tasks, you should do so.
267	You should be concerned about spiritual education at least as much as you are concerned about teaching.	Ku yi tunani dangane da tarbiyya kamar yadda kuke tunani kan neman ilimi watakila ma sama da hakan.	think about education as you think about seeking knowledge, perhaps even more than that.
268	Purify your audience and educate them.	Ku tsarkake zukatan wadanda kuke magana da su da kuma tarbiyantar da su.	pay attention to those you are talking to and also nurture them.
269	"As I said earlier, this education is difficult: ""He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others."""	"Wannan tarbiyyar kuwa kamar yadda na fadi ""Duk wanda ya nada kansa shugaba ga al'umma, to (wajibi ne) ya fara karantar da kansa kafin ya karantar da waninsa"" lamari ne mai wahala."	"this education is like what i said ""whoever appoints himself as a leader to the people, then (it is obligatory) he starts learning about himself before teaching others"" is a difficult issue."
270	And it is necessary to fulfill this difficult responsibility.	Wajibi ne a aikata wannan aiki mai wahala.	it is necessary to perform this difficult task.
271	The clergy have social responsibilities as well. They should get involved in social issues, but the essential point is that their involvement in social issues should be accompanied by spirituality not by a tendency to dominate others, otherwise their involvement will be useless.	Har ila yau kuma malamai suna da nauyi na zamantakewa a wuyansu. Wajibi ne malamai su shigo cikin batutuwa na zamantakewa; to sai dai lamari mai muhimmanci shi ne cewa wannan shiga cikin lamurra da malamai za su yi, su shiga da yanayi na malanta, ba wai da tilasci da mamaya ba.	perhaps today, the scholars are also tired of their responsibilities. it is obligatory for scholars to engage in the challenges of development; but the important issue is that this engagement that scholars will do, they will do it with a method of understanding, not with disdain and contempt.
272	The characteristic of the clergy is that they raise the awareness of people and convince them to do certain things through spirituality, ethics, advising and presenting suggestions. Of course, if you become President, you will have other responsibilities.	Siffofin da malamai suka kebanta da ita ita ce cewa ta hanyar malanta, kyawawan halaye, da nasiha da kuma nuna hanya suke jan hankulan mutanen da suke magana da sui, ku tabbatar musu da hakan, su shigo fage da wannan aikin.	the tools that the scholars use to criticize her, she is the one who says that through her negligence, great mistakes, and advice, and also showing the way, they are disturbing the minds of people who are talking with her, assure them of that, they should stop this work.
273	Prayers are everything.	Salla dai ita ce dukkan komai.	prayer is indeed everything.
274	A person who is completely isolated in terms of his relationships - if such a person preserves his relationship with prayers, he will achieve salvation.	Mutumin da dukkanin alakokinsa suka katse, idan har ya iya kiyaye alakarsa da salla, to za ta cece shi.	a man whose all relationships have been severed, if he can maintain his relationship with prayer, then it will save him.
275	Payers are very important.	Salla aba ce mai muhimmanci.	prayer is an important thing.
276	Encourage your audience to engage in prayers and prepare the way for them to take part in congregational prayers.	Ku kwadaitar da wadanda kuke magana da su da salla, ku saukaka musu hanyoyin da za su sami halartar sallolin jam'i.	engage with those you are talking to and praying with, make it easier for them to find ways to benefit from community prayers.
277	I do not know if the annual conference on prayers has ever been held in Kermanshah or not.	Wannan taron kara wa juna sani kan salla da ake gudanarwa duk shekara, ban sani ba ko ya zuwa yanzu an taba gudanar da shi a Kermanshah ko kuma a'a; lalle ku gudanar da taron a nan.	this festival informs them about the prayers that are held every year, i didn't know whether it has been held in kermanshah or not; you should hold the festival there.
278	Shia and Sunni preachers should not insult each other.	Kada masu wa'azi 'yan Shi'a da 'yan Sunna su cutar da 'yan'uwansu.	preachers of shia and sunni should stop causing trouble for their followers.
279	They should cooperate with one another.	Ku tafi tare da junanku, ku tausayawa junanku.	go with your friends, show compassion to your friends.
280	But there are certain things that they have in common and they should cooperate in those areas.	Akwai wadansu abubuwa da aka yi tarayya cikinsu, da za a iya gudanar da aiki tare.	there are some things that have been nationalized, which can be operated together.
281	By Allah's favor, the clergy will move forward if this happens.	Idan har hakan ta faru, to kuwa insha Allahu malanta za ta ci gaba.	if this continues to happen, then god willing, the lesson will continue.
282	I would tell you that when the Islamic Revolution achieved victory in Iran, Islam was revitalized in the world.	Ina son in sanar da ku cewa a lokacin da juyin juya halin Musulunci ya yi nasara (a Iran) Musulunci ya sami sabon ruhi da karfin gwuiwa a duniya.	i want to inform you that at the time when the condition of islam was deteriorating (in iran), islam gained a new spirit and strength in the world.
283	They started to wonder what driving force managed to give rise to such a great event, an event that shook the west.	Wannan wani irin inji mai karfin gaske ne da ya sami damar haifar da irin wannan gagarumin lamari da ya girgiza kasashen yammaci?	is this a kind of powerful engine that has been able to create this kind of small event that has shaken the winter countries?
284	The victory of the Islamic Revolution and the greatness of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) shook the west and the arrogant powers.	Nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci da kuma girmar Imam, sun girgiza kasashen yammaci, sun girgiza tsarin mulkin mallaka.	the success of turning the tide of islam and the respect of the imam, have shaken the winter countries, they have shaken the system of angelic rule.
285	Many people started searching for the causes, so they referred to the Holy Quran and found out certain truths about Islam.	Sun koma ga Alkur'ani, sun sami wasu bayanai dangane da Musulunci, a saboda haka sai suka zamanto masu kaunar Musulunci.	they returned to the quran, they found some information about islam, so they became lovers of islam.
286	At that juncture, Islam was faced with a wave of attacks, which continued later on. The second wave started when Marxism collapsed.	A wancan lokacin (makiya) sun fara kokarin cutar da Musulunci, kuma hakan ya ci gaba. Kumaji na biyu shi ne a lokacin da tsarin markisanci ya sha kashi.	at that time (women) began to fight against islam, and this continued. the second crisis was when the feudal system collapsed.
287	Even in Islamic countries, there were many youth and sincere people who had pinned their hopes on Marxism. They thought establishing a socialist government would eradicate poverty, injustice and other such things in their country. Some of them truly believed in Marxism.	Hatta a kasashen musulmi an sami matasa da yawan gaske wadanda mutane ne masu tsarkin zuciya da suka sanya dukkanin fatan da suke da shi ga tsarin markisanci; suna zaton cewa idan aka kafa gwamnatin gurguzu za a samu kawar da talauci da rashin adalci da kaza da kaza daga kasashensu.	even in muslim countries, there are many sincere youths who have put all their hopes in communism; they believe that if a communist government is established, it will eliminate poverty, injustice, and various other problems from their countries.
288	I met some of them in person - both Muslims and non-Muslims. They were sincere people, but they did not believe in Islam.	Wasu daga cikin su alal hakika mutane ne masu gaskiya; ni na ga wasu daga cikin su, shin musulmin cikin su ko kuwa wadanda ba musulmin ba; mutane ne masu gaskiya to amma ba su yi imani da Musulunci ba.	some of them are indeed truthful people; i have seen some of them, whether they are muslims or not; they are truthful people but they do not have faith in islam.
289	They had become supporters of Marxism because they thought Marxism held some hope for the people.	Sun zamanto 'yan gurguzu saboda suna zaton cewa akwai fata cikin gurguzu ga mutane.	they have become thieves because they believe there is wealth in theft for people.
290	But later on when Marxism collapsed, they realized that they were wrong and that Marxism was useless.	To amma a lokacin da gurguzu ya sha kashi, sai suka ga lalle ba haka lamarin ya ke, babu wata fa'ida tattare da shi.	but when the beetle was crushed, they saw that it was not as they thought, there was no benefit associated with it.
291	Therefore, they developed a tendency towards Islam.	A saboda haka sai suka kama hanyar Musulunci.	therefore, they embraced the path of islam.
292	All the youth movements that are demanding Islam in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen and other places used to shout leftist slogans during the 1960s and 1970s. They used to shout communist slogans 30, 40 years ago. And the statements of those who spoke about Islam were interspersed with Marxist ideas.	Dukkanin wadannan kungiyoyi na matasa da kuka gani a Masar da Tunusiya da Yemen da sauran wajaje, suna daga taken Musulunci ne. Dukkaninsu kuwa a baya a shekarun 1960 da 1970 - wato kimanin shekaru arba'in, talatin din da suka gabata - dukkaninsu suna rera taken gurguzu ne; idan ma har wani yana magana kan Musulunci, to kuwa hakan karkashin maganar gurguzu da ya ke yi.	all these youth groups you see in egypt, tunisia, yemen and other places, are under the banner of islam. all of them in the past, in the 1960s and 1970s - about forty, thirty years ago - all of them were singing the song of communism; if anyone speaks about islam, then that is under the discourse of communism he is making.
293	Even in our country, there were certain such people, but I do not want to mention names.	Hatta a wannan kasar ta mu akwai irin hakan; ba na son in ambaci suna ne.	even in this country of ours, there is such a thing; i don't want to mention its name.
294	There were certain people who used to speak about Islam, but they were in fact promoting Marxist ideas in their Islamic statements.	Akwai mutanen da suke magana dangane da Musulunci, to amma a karkashin wadannan maganganu a hakikanin gaskiya tunani ne na gurguzu wanda su ke yadawa.	there are people who talk about islam, but under these talks, the truth is that they are just stubborn thinkers who are misleading.
295	Such things reveal their effect somewhere. After Marxism collapsed, all these movements that had lost their faith in Marxism turned to Islam.	A bayan da gurguzu ya sha kashi, dukkanin wadannan kungiyoyi da suka yanke kauna daga gurguzu, sai suka koma ga Musulunci; suna kallon Musulunci, suna kallon Alkur'ani, suna kallon hukumce-hukumcen Musulunci, suna kallon Jamhuriyar Musulunci; su ka ga abin mamaki.	after the pumpkin had been eaten, all these groups that had expressed love for the pumpkin, then turned to islam; they look at islam, they look at the quran, they look at islamic law, they look at the islamic republic; they saw something amazing.
296	They turned to Islam, the Holy Quran, divine commands and the Islamic Republic.	A sami wani tsari da aka tabbatar da shi karkashin koyarwar Musulunci, ya rike dukkanin take na zamani da ci gaba da ake yi, dukkanin azzalumai mashaya jinin al'umma suna fada da shi, amma duk da haka sai ga shi ya tsaya kyam tamkar wani dutse.	we have found a system that has been proven under islamic education, it holds all the wealth of the time and continues to do so, all the blood of the community's victims are associated with it, but still, it stands firm like a rock.
297	"They realized that the Islamic Republic was fighting all the oppressive powers that were sucking the blood of the people, and that it was standing firm like a mountain. They were astonished. They thought, ""Let us see what this government is."""	Wadannan mutane da suke neman dukkanin abubuwan da suke bukata cikin markisanci da gurguzu amma kuma ba su samu ba, sun sha kashi gaba daya, to a halin yanzu sai ga shi suna ganin abin da suke nema din a Musulunci.	these people who are seeking all the things they need in luxury and comfort but do not get them, have suffered a great deal, so now they see what they are looking for in islam.
298	Do you see what is happening?	Kuna ganin dai me ke faruwa?	can you see what is happening?
299	They want to sideline this issue in their propaganda, but this will not affect the nature of the issue.	Suna son su kaskantar da wannan lamarin. To ba za a iya kaskantar da shi ba kuwa.	they want to discuss this issue. but it will not be possible to discuss it.
300	Thousands of people came together in the financial center of America - in the economic capital of America, New York - and they shouted that they did not want capitalism. They came together on Wall Street, which is the heart of capitalism in the world. They are neither immigrants, nor African-Americans, nor members of lower social classes.	A cibiyar kudi ta Amurka, a helkwatar tattalin arziki na Amurka wato New York, shi din ma a kan titin 'Wall Street' wanda shi ne tushen jari hujja na duniya, a sami dubban mutane su taru suna bayyana cewar ba sa son jari hujja. Su din nan ba baki ba ne, ba kuma dukkaninsu ne bakake fata ba, kungiyoyi daliban jami'a sun shigo cikinsu, suna fadin cewa mu dai ba ma son tsarin jari hujja.	at the american money market, in america's economic nerve center, new york, specifically on 'wall street' which is the world's stock exchange hub, crowds of people gathered expressing their dislike for the stock exchange system. these weren't just ordinary people, nor were they all poor, university student groups were among them, saying that they too do not like the stock exchange system.
301	"We have said from the beginning that we want ""neither the east, nor the west"" - that is to say, we neither want the capitalist system, nor the socialist system."	To wannan dai shi ne abin da muke fadi; mu ma dai tun daga farko muna fadin cewa 'ba gabashi ba, ba kuma yammaci ba' wato mu dai ba mu amince da tsarin jari hujja ba, haka nan kuma ba mu amince da tsarin gurguzu ba.	this is what we are saying; we have been saying from the beginning that 'no rush, no force' meaning we do not agree with the system of forced argument, and we also do not agree with the system of coercion.
302	You should be prepared.	Wajibi ne ku din nan ku zamnato cikin shiri.	it is your duty to participate in this plan.
303	Muslim clergy should be prepared.	Malaman Musulunci wajibi ne su zamanto cikin shiri.	it is obligatory for islamic scholars to become part of the planning.
304	It is necessary to promote the logical, firm and deep-rooted teachings of Islam, which have been extracted from the Holy Quran, Sunnah and the statements of the infallible Imams (a.s.) - firm and reasonable intellectual principles which are in line with the needs of human beings and human societies.	A yi watsi da maganganu marasa tushe; a yi riko da koyarwar Musulunci karfafa kuma masu tushe da suka samo asali daga Alkur'ani da Sunna da maganganun Ma'asumai (amincin Allah ya tabbata a gare su); dalilai da suka yi daidai da hankali, hankali ya yarda da su sannan kuma suka yi daidai da bukatun dan'adam da kuma al'umma.	stop the endless discussions; engage in the teaching of islam that strengthens and those who have obtained the original from the quran and sunnah and the sayings of the innocents (may allah's peace be upon them); arguments that are reasonable, the mind agrees with them and they are in line with the needs of man and society.
305	You will see that the tendency towards Islam will grow stronger.	Idan kuka yi hakan za ku ga yadda kaunar Musulunci za ta karu.	if you do this, you will see how the love of islam will increase.
306	There are many things that I want to discuss with you and as I said, this meeting has been very enjoyable for me, but there is not enough time.	To ni dai ina da maganganu da yawa da ku. Haka nan kuma wannan zama a wajena - kamar yadda na bayyana - zama ce mai faranta rai; to amma dai wajibi ne a lura da lokaci.	for me, i have a lot of conversations with you. and this is my situation - as i have explained - a situation that brings joy; but it is necessary to be mindful of time.
307	Dear God, let us be among the learned religious scholars who please You.	Ya Ubangiji Allah! Ka sanya malaman addini cikin abubuwan da ka yarda da su.	oh lord god! place religious scholars in things that you have approved of.
308	Dear God, provide our youth and these young seminarians - who are the saplings of the garden of religious knowledge - with the opportunity to become active religious scholars, no matter where they live: in Kermanshah or other places.	Ya Ubangiji Allah! Ka ba wa wadannan matasa masu girma da wadannan matasan dalibai masu neman ilimin addini - a garin Kermanshah da wanin Kermanshah - dacewa su zamanto malamai masu aiki.	oh lord god! give these mature youths and these student youths seeking religious education - in the city of kermanshah and the province of kermanshah - the suitability to become working scholars.
309	Bestow Your grace, mercy and guidance on all of us.	Ka saukar da rahama da shiriyarka a kan dukkanin mu.	bestow your mercy and plan upon all of us.
310	Make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake) satisfied with us.	Ka sanya zuciyar mai girma Waliyul Asr (rayukanmu su zamanto fansa a gare shi) ta yarda da mu.	you have placed the great-hearted waliyul asr (may your ancestors be his ransom) in agreement with us.

316	Considering the resignation of Mr. Mohammad Sarafraz and thanking him for his heartfelt revolutionary and valuable endeavors – which should never be forgotten - I appoint you who enjoys a revolutionary background and who has managerial experience in the national media, as head of the IRIB.	Bisa la'akari da murabus din da Malam Muhammad Sarafraz yayi da kuma mika godiya a gare shi saboda irin gagarumin kokari na juyin juya hali da kishin da ya nuna wanda bai kamata a mance da hakan ba, sannan kuma saboda irin tsohon tarihin da kake da shi na riko da koyarwar juyin juya halin Musulunci da kuma kwarewa ta shugabanci a hukumar watsa labarai ta kasa, don haka na nada ka a matsayin shugaban hukumar gidan radiyo da talabijin.	in recognition of the tremendous effort and dedication shown by malam muhammad sarafraz, and the gratitude expressed towards him for his unparalleled commitment and devotion, which should not be overlooked, and also for his long history of involvement and teaching in the affairs of islam and his proficiency in leadership in the national broadcasting corporation, i therefore appoint you as the head of the radio and television corporation.

325	In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful	Da Sunan Allah Mai Rahama Mai Jin Kai	in the name of god, the most gracious, the most merciful.
326	All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem al-Mustafa Muhammad, upon his immaculate, pure, chosen, guided and infallible household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.	Dukkan godiya ta tabbata ga Allah Ubangijin talikai. Tsira da amincin Allah su tabbata ga shugabanmu kuma Annabinmu Abul Kasim al-Mustafa Muhammad tare da Iyalansa tsarkaka, zababbu shiryayyu kuma masu shiryarwa, musamman ma Wanzajjen Allah a bayan kasa (Imam Mahdi).	all thanks are due to allah, the lord of the worlds. the praise and peace of allah be upon our leader and our prophet abul kasim al-mustafa muhammad, along with his pure and purified progeny, especially the remaining allah on earth (imam mahdi).
327	We are thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave us another opportunity to commemorate our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) on such a day and express our respect for him.	Muna gode wa Allah Madaukakin Sarki da ya sake ba mu wata dama da kuma karin shekaru don sake girmama Imaminmu mai girma a irin wannan ranar da kuma nuna so da kaunarmu a gare shi.	we thank allah, the almighty king, for giving us another chance and adding more years to celebrate our esteemed imam on this day and to express our love and affection for him.
328	Although the memory of Imam (r.a.) is alive among our people at all times, the 14th of Khordad is the manifestation of the Iranian nation's love for him.	Duk da cewa ambaton Imam a koda yaushe ya kasance a raye cikin zukatan al'ummarmu, to amma ranar 14 ga watan Khordad wata alama ce ta nuna so da kaunar al'ummar Iran ga marigayi Imam mai girma.	although the imam's mission is always alive in the hearts of our community, but the 14th of khordad is a symbol of the love and affection of the iranian people for the late great imam.
329	This year the demise anniversary of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) has coincided with the martyrdom anniversary of his great ancestor, Imam Musa ibn Ja'far (a.s.).	A bana, wannan ranar ta yi daidai da ranar shahadar kakansa mai girma, wato Imam Musa bn Ja'afar (amincin Allah ya tabbata a gare shi).	no, this day is equivalent to his elder brother's commemoration day, that is imam musa bn ja'afar (may allah's peace be upon him).
330	Also, this occasion has coincided with the 50th anniversary of the determining and important event that took place on the 15th of Khordad in the year 1342.	Haka nan kuma wannan shekarar ta yi daidai da shekaru hamsin da faruwar lamarin nan mai matukar muhimmanci na 15 ga watan Khordad na shekarar 1342 (Yunin 1963, mafarin juyin juya halin Musulunci na Iran).	thus, this year also coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the extremely important event of the 15th of khordad of the year 1342 (june 1963, the turning point of the islamic movement in iran).
331	The 15th of Khordad was an important historical juncture.	Ranar 15 ga watan Khordad wata rana ce mai muhimmanci da kuma ayyana makoma.	the 15th day of the month of khordad is a significant day that also marks milestones.
332	I would like to briefly discuss a few points in this regard and then I will discuss the pressing issues that are necessary to discuss.	Zan yi magana a takaice kan hakan kafin in je ga batu na asali kuma na wajibi da zan yi magana kansa.	i will discuss this in detail before i go to the main issue and i am obliged to talk about it.
333	The 15th of Khordad was not the beginning of the great movement by the people and the clergy.	Ranar 15 ga watan Khordad ba ita ce mafarin gagarumin yunkurin malamai da mutane ba.	the 15th day of khordad is not a celebration of the great efforts of scholars and people.
334	Before the 15th of Khordad, important events had taken place in the year 1341 as well as at the beginning of the year 1342.	Kafin ranar 15 ga watan Khordad, akwai wasu batutuwa masu muhimmanci da suka faru a shekarar 1341 da kuma farko-farkon shekarar 1342.	before the 15th day of khordad month, there were some important events that happened in the year 1341 and early in the year 1342.
335	For example, the event in Feiziyeh School took place on the 2nd of Farvardin in 1342: it resulted in the injury of seminarians and the insult to the great marja taqlid, the late Ayatollah Golpaygani.	Ga misali, abin da ya faru a makarantar Faiziyya ya faru ne a ranar 2 ga watan Farbardeen shekarar 1342, lamarin da ya kai ga bugu da kuma raunana daliban addini bugu da kari kan cin mutumcin babban marja'i marigayi Ayatullah Golpaygani.	for example, what happened at faiziyya school happened on the 2nd day of february in the year 1342, an incident that led to the death and injury of religious students, a tragedy that greatly affected the late grand ayatollah golpaygani.
336	Before that event, towards the end of the year 1341, there were demonstrations in Tehran's bazaar and the great marja taqlid, the late Ayatollah Hajj Sayyid Ahmad Khansari, was insulted.	Kafin nan, a karshe-karshen shekarar 1341, lamarin zanga-zangar mutane a kasuwar Tehran ya kunno kai, a nan ma an ci mutumcin babban marja'i marigayi Ayatullah Hajj Sayyid Ahmad Khunsari.	before then, at the end of the year 1341, the issue of people's protest in the tehran market escalated, there also the late grand marja'i ayatullah hajj sayyid ahmad khunsari was eaten.
337	These things show that the movement by the clergy had reached such levels in 1341 and early 1342 that security forces of the oppressive regime had started to treat seminarians, religious scholars and even marja taqlids in a brutal way.	Dukkanin wadannan abubuwa ne da suke nuni da cewa yunkurin malamai a shekarar 1341 da kuma farko-farkon 1342 ya kai wani matsayi na girma ta yadda ‘yan sanda da jami'an tsaron gwamnatin zalunci na lokacin ta yi amfani da karfi sosai a kan malamai da dalibai kai hatta ma maraja'ai ba su tsira ba.	all these things indicate that the scholars' efforts in the year 1341 and early 1342 have reached a high level, such that the police and government security forces at the time made extensive use of force against the scholars and students, even the elites were not spared.
338	However, the 15th of Khordad of 1342 was a very important juncture.	To amma duk da hakan, ranar 15 ga watan Khordad wani lokaci ne mai matukar muhimmanci.	however, despite all this, the 15th day of khordad is a time of great importance.
339	The reason is that the event which took place on the 15th of Khordad revealed that the bond between the people and the clergy had reached a so-called dangerous level.	Dalilin hakan kuwa shi ne cewa abin da ya faru a ranar 15 ga watan Khordad 1342, lamari ne da ke nuni da alakar da ke tsakanin mutane da malamai a wancan lokacin mai hatsarin gaske.	the reason for this is that what happened on the 15th of khordad 1342, is an event that indicates the relationship between people and clerics at that dangerous time.
340	In that year, on the anniversary of Ashura - which fell on the 13th of Khordad - our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) delivered a historic speech in Feiziyeh School.	A ranar Ashurar wancan shekarar - wadda ta kasance ranar 13 ga watan Khordad ce - mai girma Imam ya gabatar da wani jawabi mai matukar muhimmanci a makarantar Faiziyya.	on the day of ashura that year - which was the 13th day of the month of khordad - the great imam delivered a very important speech at the faiziyya school.
341	Later on when they had arrested Imam (r.a.), on the 15th of Khordad there was a great movement in Tehran as well as in Qom and other cities and the taghuti regime decided to do everything in its power to suppress the movement by relying on its army, police and security organizations.	Daga baya jami'an tsaro suka kama Imam, a ranar 15 ga watan Khordad, a Tehran haka nan kuma a Kum da wasu garuruwan na daban, mutane sun fito zanga-zanga. Gwamnatin Dagutu ta wancan lokacin kuwa ta fito da dukkan karfinta, da sojoji da ‘yan sanda da sauran jami'an tsaron fararen kaya, ta yi diran mikiya a kan mutane. A ranar 15 ga watan Khordad an sami wani yunkuri na mutane.	from the past, security forces arrested imam on the 15th of khordad in tehran and also in kum and other different cities, people came out in protest. the dagutu government at that time came out with all its power, with soldiers and police and other security forces in full force, it fired tear gas on the people. on the 15th of khordad, a people's attempt was found.
342	The point is that it was this bond that ensured the spread and victory of the movement.	Abin luran a nan shi ne cewa irin wannan alakar ita ce lamunin ci gaban wannan yunkurin da kuma kai shi zuwa ga nasara.	the implication here is that this kind of relationship is the key to advancing this effort and leading it to success.
343	Wherever a movement is supported by the people, that movement will prevail.	A duk inda aka sami wani yunkuri da yake da goyon bayan mutane da kuma tafiya tare da su, to kuwa wannan yunkurin zai ci gaba.	wherever there is an effort that has the support of people and also travels with them, then this effort will continue.
344	But if the people do not develop a bond with a protest movement, that movement will fail.	Amma idan har mutane ba su shigo cikin wani yunkuri na nuna rashin amincewa ba, to kuwa ba zai yi nasara ba.	but if people do not participate in any attempt to show dissatisfaction, then it will not succeed.
345	For example, after the Constitutional Movement in Iran, there were certain events and certain activities by both leftist and nationalist groups, but all of them were destined to fail because they did not have the support of the people.	Kamar yadda ya faru a Iran lokacin yunkurin kundin tsarin mulki. ‘Yan gurguzu da masu kishin kasa sun yunkura to amma yunkurin na su ya sha kashi. Saboda mutane ba su tare da su.	just like what happened in iran at the time of the coup attempt. the thugs and the rebels planned but their plot failed. because the people were not with them.
346	When the people step into the arena and support a movement with their hearts and minds and with their presence, it becomes possible for that movement to prevail and achieve victory.	A lokacin da mutane suka shigo fage sannan kuma suka goyi bayan wani yunkurin, sannan dukkanin tunani da karfin mutane ya zamanto tare da shi, to kuwa wannan yunkurin zai ci gaba da wanzuwa da kuma samun nasara.	at the time when people entered the arena and then rallied behind a certain effort, and all thoughts and human strength became associated with it, then this effort will continue to progress and achieve success.
347	The event that took place on the 15th of Khordad proved this point.	Hakan kuwa shi ne abin da ya faru a ranar 15 ga watan Khordad.	this indeed happened on the 15th day of the month of khordad.
348	The arrest of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) resulted in such an uprising in Tehran and certain other parts of the country that the regime had to step in to suppress the people in a brutal way. A large number of people were killed.	Sakamakon irin mutanen da suka fito a garin Tehran da sauran garuruwa daga jin labarin an kama Imam, lamarin da ya tilasta wa gwamnati shigowa da dukkan karfinta da diran mikiya a kan mutane; ta yadda aka kashe wani adadi mai yawa na mutane.	as a result of the kind of people that came out in the city of tehran and other cities from hearing the news of the imam's arrest, a situation that forced the government to intervene with all its might and impose a curfew on people; in such a way that a large number of people were killed.
349	The streets of Tehran were covered with the blood of pious people and youth.	Titunan Tehran suka cika da jinin bayin Allah mumimai da matasa masu kishi.	the streets of tehran are filled with the blood of allah's faithful men and young people who are suffering.
350	On the 15th of Khordad, the brutal and ruthless nature of the taghuti regime was fully revealed.	A ranar 15 ga watan Khordad dan mulkin kama-karya da kuma irin zuciya maras imani ta dagutu ta bayyana a fili.	on the 15th day of the month of khordad, the heartless and faithless rule was exposed and fell apart in the open.
351	Another point regarding the event which happened on the 15th of Khordad - a point to which our youth and dear people should pay attention - is that no international community and none of the so-called human rights organizations protested against the brutal killings in Tehran and other parts of the country.	Wani batun kuma da ke cikin wannan lamari na 15 ga watan Khordad - wanda yana da kyau matasanmu da mutanenmu masu girma su lura da shi - shi ne cewa a yayin wannan kisan kiyashin da aka yi wa mutane a Tehran da sauran garuruwa, babu wata cibiya ta kasa da kasa, wadanda suke kiran kansu cibiyoyin kare hakkokin bil'adama, da ya ce wani abu; babu wani da ya nuna rashin amincewarsa.	another issue that is part of this 15th of khordad event - which is good for our young and old people to pay attention to - is that during this bloody massacre that was done to people in tehran and other cities, there was not a single lowland or highland, which they call human rights sanctuaries, that said anything; there was no one who showed his disagreement.
352	The people and the clergy remained in the arena.	Mutane da malamai sun kasance su kadai ne kawai a fagen.	people and scholars were the only ones present at the scene.
353	They said that it was a feudalist movement. The nationalists - who were claiming to support anti-government activities - also condemned the movement.	Su ma masu da'awar kishin kasa - da suke da'awar goyon bayan gwagwarmayar fada da gwamnati - su ma sun yi Allah wadai da wannan yunkurin; suna cewa wannan wani makahon yunkuri ne maras manufa, wani yunkuri ne na wuce gona da iri.	they too, the environmental activists - who are advocating for the protection of the environment against government negligence - they too have rejected this initiative; they say this is a deceptive initiative without benefit, an initiative to destroy crops and species.
354	Wherever lazy people fail to take risks and play a role in the arena, they accuse pious combatants of extremism. They said that the movement was an extremist movement.	A duk lokacin da masu neman sauki da jin dadi suka gagara sama wa kansu waje a cikin gwagwarmayar da ake yi, nan take za su zargi muminan mutane masu gwagwarmaya da tsaurin ra'ayi da wuce gona da iri.	whenever those seeking relief and pleasure excessively indulge themselves in the enjoyment of the environment, they will then blame the innocent people who care about the environment and exceed in farming and planting.
355	They rejected it as a radical movement. Imam (r.a.) remained in the arena, relying on the support of the people, and he managed to present the image of a truly decisive and determined spiritual leader to all people and to all history.	Suna fadin cewa, wadannan masu tsaurin ra'ayi ne, yunkurin wani yunkuri ne na wuce gona da iri. Imam, sakamakon goyon bayan al'umma da ya samu, ya ci gaba da wannan yunkuri nasa, sannan kuma ya tabbatar wa duniya da kuma tarihi matsayinsa na wani jagora na addini sannan kuma mai azamar cimma manufar da ya sa a gaba.	they are saying that these hardliners are trying to go beyond farming and species. the imam, as a result of the support he received from the community, continued with this effort, and then confirmed to the world and history his status as a religious leader and also a tormentor who achieved the goal he set for the future.
356	Our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) had three beliefs which made him decisive, courageous and steadfast: namely, faith in God, faith in the people and faith in himself. These three beliefs revealed themselves in the character, decisions and actions of Imam (r.a.) in the true sense of the word.	Imam dai ya kasance yana da wasu abubuwa guda uku da ya yi imani da su, wadanda su ne suka ba shi azama, jaruntaka da kuma tsayin daka. Wadannan abubuwa ukun kuwa su ne: imani da Allah, imani da karfin mutane da kuma imani da kai. Wadannan imani guda uku sun bayyanar da kansu cikin samuwa da kuma matsayar da Imam yake dauka.	the imam has always had three things he believed in, which gave him courage, motivation, and resilience. these three things are: belief in god, belief in the power of people, and belief in oneself. these three beliefs have defined their existence and the humility with which the imam carries himself.
357	Imam (r.a.) spoke to the people through his heart and the people accepted his call with their heart and soul.	Imam yana magana ne daga tsakiyar zuciyarsa, sannan su kuma mutane suka amsa masa wannan kira nasa da dukkanin abin da suka mallaka.	the imam is speaking from the bottom of his heart, and then the people responded to his call with everything they possessed.
358	They stepped into the arena and resisted in a brave way.	Suka shigo fage da kuma tsayin daka.	they entered quietly and also stood still.
359	Their movement - which had no sympathizers in the world and received no assistance - gradually moved towards ultimate victory.	Suka kai wannan yunkuri, wanda ba shi da magoya baya a duniya, zuwa ga nasara.	they took this attempt, which has no supporters in the world, to victory.
360	I would like to briefly explain the three beliefs of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).	Yanzu bari in dan yi karin bayani kan wadannan imani guda uku da Imam yake da su.	now let me give more explanation on these three faiths that the imam has.
361	The points I will discuss in this regard are important points that can illuminate our path only if they find their way into our hearts.	Wadannan wasu abubuwa ne masu muhimmanci wadanda idan har muka fahimce su, to kuwa za su haskaka mana hanyarmu.	these are some important things that if we understand them, they will indeed illuminate our path.
362	"Regarding faith in God, Imam (r.a.) was the manifestation of this holy ayah: ""Those to whom the people said: Surely men have gathered against you, therefore fear them, but this increased their faith, and they said: Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector."""	"Dangane da imani da Allah, Imam ya kasance alama ta ayar nan da take cewa: ""Wadanda mutane suka ce musu: ‘Lalle ne, mutane sun taru (rundunoni) saboda ku, don haka ku ji tsoronsu."	"regarding faith in allah, the imam has become a sign of this saying: ""those people who say to them: 'indeed, people have gathered against you, so fear them."
363	"[The Holy Quran, 3: 173] Imam (r.a.) was firmly committed to ""Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector"" with all his heart and soul."	"Sai wannan maganar ta kara musu imani, kuma suka ce: Allah ne Mai isar mana kuma madalla da wannan Wakilin"" (suratu Al Imrana 3:173)."	"then this statement increased their faith, and they said: allah is the one who provides for us and is the best to rely on"" (surah al imran 3:173)."
364	"He acted, worked and spoke for the sake of God and he knew that ""if you help (the cause of) Allah, He will help you"" [The Holy Quran, 47: 7] is a divine promise and that it is definite and inviolable."	"Ya yunkura ne saboda Allah, ya yi magana da kuma aiki a kas yana da yakinin cewa: ""Idan kun taimaki Allah, zai taimake ku"" (Suratu Muhammad 47:7), wannan dai alkawari ne na Ubangiji, wanda tabbas ne zai cika shi, babu wani kokwanto cikin hakan."	"he is determined for the sake of allah, he speaks and works in the country with the belief that: ""if you help allah, he will help you"" (surah muhammad 47:7), this is a promise from the lord, who will surely fulfill it, there is no doubt about it."
365	Regarding faith in the people, our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) knew the Iranian nation in the true sense of the word.	Dangane da imani da mutane, mai girma Imam (r.a) ya fahimci al'ummar Iran da dukkanin ma'anar wannan kalmar.	regarding faith and people, the great imam (r.a) understood the people of iran and the entire meaning of this word.
366	Imam (r.a.) believed that our nation enjoys deep religious faith and is intelligent and courageous, a nation that has the capacity to shine like the sun in different areas only if it has competent leaders.	Imam ya yi amanna da cewa wannan al'ummar, al'umma ce ma'abociyar imani, mai hankali da kuma jaruntaka; wacce matukar ta sami wani jagora wanda ya dace, to kuwa za ta iya bayyanar da kanta a dukkanin fagage tamkar hasken rana.	the imam firmly believes that this community, a community of faith, mindfulness, and mutual respect; which has greatly found a suitable leader, will indeed be able to express itself in all aspects like the sunlight.
367	One time an incompetent person like Shah Sultan Hussein caused the Iranian nation to retreat into a corner, but another time a courageous person like Nader Gholi - without those honorary titles - emerged among the people and became their leader by relying on his courage and as a result, our nation managed to expand the arena of its glory from Delhi to the Black Sea.	Imam ya yi amanna da hakan. Idan har a wani lokaci mutane marasa dacewa irin su Shah Sultan Husain sun kaskantar da al'ummar Iran, to amma a wani lokacin kuma jaruman mutane irin su Nadeer Kali - ba tare da wadannan lakabobi da yake da su ba - sun bayyanar da kansu cikin mutane sannan cikin dukkanin jaruntaka sun jagoranci al'umma, sakamakon hakan al'ummarmu ta iya bayyanar da kanta tun daga Delhi har zuwa ga ‘Black Sea'.	the imam has affirmed this. if at any time people like shah sultan husain have misled the people of iran, but at other times, actors like nadeer kali - without these nicknames they have - have shown themselves among people and in all their actions they have led the community, as a result our community has been able to express itself from delhi to the black sea.
368	He had faith in the Iranian nation.	Ya fahimci al'ummar Iran, sannan kuma ya yi amanna da su.	he understands the people of iran, and he also trusts them.
369	He provoked the people's religious pride and the Iranian nation became the role model of resistance and insight.	Ya bayyanar da kishin addini da suke da shi ta yadda al'ummar Iran sun zamanto wani abin koyi na tsayin daka da kuma basira.	he explained the religious fervor they have in such a way that the people of iran have adopted it as a form of learning and wisdom.
370	In the eyes of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.), the people were the dearest and enemies of the people were the most hated.	Mutane dai sun kasance mafiya soyuwa a wajen Imam, sannan makiyan al'umma kuma a matsayin mafi girman abin kyama.	people have mostly been respectful towards the imam, and then the community members also in the position of great respect for the tragedy.
371	The fact that Imam (r.a.) did not stop his battle against the domineering powers even for one single moment, was mainly because the domineering powers were enemies of the people's happiness, and Imam (r.a.) believed that enemies of the people were his enemies too.	Wannan shi ne dalilin da ya sanya kuke ganin Imam bai taba nuna gazawa ba a fagen fada da ‘yan mulkin mallaka masu takama da karfi saboda ‘yan mulkin mallaka sun zamanto masu adawa da jin dadin al'umma, sannan kuma Imam yana ganin masu kiyayya da mutane a matsayin abokan gaba.	this is the reason why you see the imam never showed aggression in the palace with the powerful ruling elites because the ruling elites have become enemies and enjoy the suffering of the people, and also the imam sees the righteous and the people as future allies.
372	As for self-confidence, Imam (r.a.) taught the people of Iran to be confident.	Dangane da batun yarda da kai kuma, Imam ya koyar da al'ummar Iran cewa ‘lalle za mu iya'.	regarding the issue of agreeing with you, the imam taught the people of iran that 'indeed we can'.
373	Before instilling a sense of confidence into the people of Iran, Imam (r.a.) first revived this sense of self-confidence in himself. He exhibited his faith in his capabilities in the true sense of the word. On the anniversary of Ashura in the year 1342, while he was alone, Imam (r.a.) threatened the Shah that he would ask the people of Iran to force him out of the country if he continued acting like that.	Ya bayyanar wa duniya irin karfin da yake da shi. A ranar Ashurar 1342, duk da matsin lamba, haka Imam ya bayyana a gaban dalibai da mutanen Kum a makarantar Faiziyya, ya yi wa sarki Muhammad Ridha Shah, wanda ya dogara da Amurka da masu takama da karfi na waje, wanda kuma yake gudanar da mulki ba tare da wani kaidi ko sharadi ba, ya yi masa barazana cewa matukar ka ci gaba da abin da kake yi, to kuwa zan gaya wa mutane da su kore ka daga Iran.	he demonstrated to the world the strength he possessed. on the day of ashura 1342, despite the severity of the cold, imam stood in front of the students and people of kum in faiziyya school, he challenged king muhammad ridha shah, who relied on america and those seeking power abroad, who also ruled without any law or regulation, he warned him that if you continue doing what you are doing, then i will tell the people to expel you from iran.
374	This threat was made by a cleric in Qom who had no weapons, no equipment, no money and no international support.	Wani malami ne mazaunin garin Kum, wanda ba shi da wani makami, ko kudi ko kuma goyon baya da taimako na kasa da kasa ba.	a scholar is a resident of kum town, who has no means, neither money nor support to help from one place to another.
375	He managed to resist in this arena by relying on his faith in God and in himself.	Imani da Allah da kuma yarda da kai ne zai tabbatar da mutum a wannan fagen.	faith in god and self-acceptance will ensure a person's success in this stage.
376	The day when Imam (r.a.) returned from exile, he threatened the government of Bakhtiar at Behesht Zahra Cemetery and he announced in a resonating voice that he would punch Bakhtiar's government in the mouth and that he would establish another government.	Haka nan a wancan lokacin da Imam ya dawo daga gudun hijira, a wannan makabarta ta Beheshti Zahra, Imam ya yi wa gwamnatin Bakhtiyar barazana da fadi a fili cewa: zan bugi bakin gwamnatin Bakktiyar, ni ne zan ayyana gwamnati. Wannan dogaro da kai ne.	thus, at that time when imam returned from his exile, in this message at beheshti zahra, imam openly challenged bakhtiyar's government and declared: i will break bakhtiyar's government, i will establish the government. this is a promise to you.
377	Imam (r.a.) had faith in himself and in his capabilities.	Imam ya yi amanna da kansa da irin karfin da ya ke da shi.	the imam has faith in himself and the strength he possesses.
378	It was this self-confidence that was transferred to the people of Iran through his words and actions.	Irin wannan yarda da Allah din kuwa da Imam yake da shi, shi ne ya mika shi zuwa ga mutane.	like this agreement with allah and the imam who has it, he is the one who presented it to the people.
379	And we had started to believe these things. Instilling a sense of inability - with the purpose of making nations lose faith in their capabilities - is one of the effective ways in which domineering powers spread their domination over different nations.	Kuma wasu sun yarda da hakan. Daya daga cikin makami mai tasiri da makiya suka rika wajen tabbatar da ikonsu a kan sauran al'ummomi, shi ne sanya musu jin cewa ‘ba za su iya ba', don mutane su yanke kauna, su dinga fadin cewa babu wani abin da za mu iya yi.	and some have agreed to this. one of the influential leaders and his followers have been confirming their support for the rest of the public, making them feel that 'they can't', because people make decisions out of love, they keep saying that there is nothing we can do.
380	In this way, they managed to keep the Iranian nation backwards in politics, science and economic activities as well as in all other arenas of life.	Da hakan ne suka ciyar da al'ummar Iran baya na tsawon shekaru dari a fagagen siyasa, ilimi, tattalin arziki da sauran fagage na rayuwa.	that is how they led the people of iran backwards for decades in the fields of politics, education, economy and other aspects of life.
381	"He told the Iranian nation, ""You can."""	Ya gaya wa al'ummar Iran cewa ‘Lalle za ku iya'.	he told the people of iran that 'surely you can'.
382	He restored our courage. He restored our determination. He restored our self-confidence.	Ya dawo mana da jaruntaka, ya dawo mana da irin tsayin daka wajen daukar matsayar da ta dace, ya dawo mana da yarda da dogaro da kai.	he has returned to us with your meeting, he has returned to us with the kind of strength you have for taking responsibility that is appropriate, he has returned to us with agreeing and trusting in you.
383	For this reason, the Iranian nation has achieved victory over the past thirty-something in all the areas that I will discuss later on in this meeting.	Mun yunkura; a saboda haka ne al'ummar Iran, tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da wani abun muka sami nasarori a dukkanin fagagen, da a nan gaba zan yi ishara da su.	we have tried; therefore, it is for this reason that the people of iran, over these thirty years, we have achieved successes in all fields, and from now on i will refer to them.
384	These three beliefs of Imam (r.a.) - namely faith in God, faith in the people and faith in himself - became the axis of all his decisions, actions and policies.	Wadannan yarda da imanin da suke tare da Imam, wato imani da Allah, imani da mutane da kuma yarda da kai, sun kasance su ne tushen dukkanin matsaya, ayyuka da kuma siyasarsa.	these beliefs and faiths that they have with the imam, that is, faith in allah, faith in people and also belief in oneself, have always been their foundation in all positions, works and politics.
385	At the beginning of the movement, these three beliefs were a source of energy for Imam (r.a.).	A farko farkon wannan gwagwarmayar, wadannan imani guda ukun su ne suka ba wa Imam karfi.	at the beginning of this revolution, these ten faiths were what gave the imam strength.
386	The same is true of the time when he was in exile, the time when he left for Paris and the time when he returned to Iran.	A lokacin da aka tilasta masa gudun hijira ma haka lamarin ya kasance; a lokacin da ya kama hanyar zuwa Paris ma haka lamarin ya kasance, a lokacin da ya dawo Iran ma haka lamarin ya kasance.	at the time when he was forced to migrate, that's how the situation was; when he found his way to paris, that's how the situation was, when he returned to iran, that's how the situation was.
387	It was these three beliefs that gave Imam (r.a.) the power to enter Tehran in those conditions.	Wadannan abubuwa guda uku su ne suka ba wa Imam karfin gwiwan dawowa Tehran a irin wancan yanayin da ake ciki.	these three things are what gave the imam the strength to return to tehran in the situation he was in.
388	"These three beliefs were exhibited in the events that happened during Bahman of 1357, in the fitnas that happened in the country, in the establishment of the Islamic Republic, in his open resistance against the oppressive global order, in the slogan of ""neither the East, nor the West"", in the imposed war and in all the events that took place in those eventful ten years of Imam's life."	A lamarin da ya faru a watan Bahman na 1357 (lokacin nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci), a lokacin fitinun cikin gida, a lokacin sanar da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci, a tsayin dakan da ya yi wajen tinkarar azzaluman gwamnatocin duniya, a lokacin sanar da taken ‘Ba Gabashi ba, Ba Kuma Yammaci Ba', a lokacin kallafaffen yaki, cikin dukkanin lamurran da suka faru tsawon wadannan shekaru 10 na rayuwar Imam, dukkanin wadannan imani guda uku sun bayyanar da kansu a tattare da Imam.	the incident that occurred in the month of bahman 1357 (at the time of the victory of the islamic revolution), during the house wars, when the islamic republic was announced, during the stand against the world's superpowers, during the announcement of the slogan 'no east, no west', during the war efforts, in all the incidents that have occurred over these past 10 years of imam's life, all these three faiths have revealed themselves in association with the imam.
389	These three beliefs were the basis of Imam's decisions, actions and policies.	Wadannan abubuwa guda ukun su ne tushen matsayar da Imam yake dauka da kuma dukkanin abubuwan da yake gudanarwa.	these three things are the burden that the imam carries and all the things he is doing.
390	Even in the last few days of his life, nobody noticed any signs of despair, doubt, exhaustion, weakness or submission in the words and actions of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).	Har zuwa karshen rayuwarsa, babu wani da ya taba ganin wata alama ta rauni da gajiyawa ko shakku da mika wuya cikin maganganu da kuma ayyukan mai girma Imam.	until the end of his life, there was no one who ever saw a sign of anger, fatigue, doubt or difficulty in the words and great deeds of the imam.
391	Many revolutionaries throughout the world start to have doubts and become conservative as they grow older.	Da dama daga cikin ma'abota juyin juya hali na duniya, a duk lokacin da shekaru suka fara ja musu, su kan fara fuskantar shakku cikin abin da suke yi.	like many of the world's skeptics, whenever years begin to elude them, they start to doubt what they are doing.
392	Sometimes they even take back their main statements.	Kai a wasu lokuta ma su kan dawo daga rakiyar hatta maganganun da suka fadi a baya.	sometimes they can return from the journey even with the words they said in the past.
393	The statements that were issued by Imam (r.a.) during the last few years of his life were sometimes even more strongly worded and revolutionary than his statements in the year 1342.	Amma Imam kan a'a, jawaban da ya yi a karshe-karshen rayuwarsa sun ma fi jawaban da ya yi a shekarar 1342 kumaji da zafi.	however, the imam's refusal, the answers he gave at the end of his life were even more than the answers he gave in the year 1342 full of heat and fire.
394	He was growing old, but he was young at heart and his soul was vibrant.	Ya tsufa, amma zuciyarsa ta matasa ce, ruhinsa a raye yake.	he is old, but his heart is young, his spirit lives on.
395	"This is the same steadfastness that has been described in the Holy Quran: ""And that if they should keep to the (right) way, We would certainly give them to drink of abundant water."""	"Wannan shi ne tsayin dakan da aka yi maganarsa a cikin Alkur'ani da cewa: ""Kuma da sun tsayu sosai a kan hanya, da lalle Mun shayar da su ruwa mai yawa"" (Suratul Jinn 72:16)."	"this is the verse that was discussed in the quran which says: ""and that when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. and whoever believes in his lord will not fear deprivation or burden"" (suratul jinn 72:16)."
396	"[The Holy Quran, 72: 16] In another ayah, Allah the Exalted says: ""(As for) those who say: Our Lord is Allah, then continue in the right way, the angels descend upon them, saying: Fear not, nor be grieved, and receive good news of the garden which you were promised."" [The Holy Quran, 41: 30] These three beliefs kept Imam (r.a.) young and vibrant."	"A wata ayar ma ta daban yana fadin cewa: ""Lalle wadannan da suka ce, ‘Ubangijinmu, Shi ne Allah, sa'an nan suka daidaitu, mala'iku na sassauka a kansu (suna ce musu), ‘Kada ku ji tsoro, kuma kada ku yi bakin ciki, kuma ku yi bushara da Aljanna, wadda kun kasance ana yi muku alkawari da ita"" (Suratu Fussilat 41:30) wadannan imani guda ukun su ne suka rike Imam; suka tabbatar da tunani da tafarki da hanyarsa ga wannan al'ummar, sannan a sannu a hankali suka tabbatar cikin al'ummarmu da matasanmu da sauran bangarori daban-daban; suka samar da fata da dogaro da kai da kuma dogaro da Allah cikin al'umma."	"in another version, it says: ""indeed, those who say, 'our lord is allah,' and then remain steadfast - the angels will descend upon them, [saying], 'do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of paradise, which you were promised"" (surah fussilat 41:30) these ten faiths are what they held onto as their imam; they confirmed with thought and contemplation and his way to this nation, then slowly and carefully they confirmed within our nation and our youth and other various categories; they provided courage and trust and self and also trust in allah within the nation."
397	"These things replaced despair and pessimism. The people of Iran changed their characteristics and Allah the Exalted changed their conditions. ""Surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition."""	"Al'ummar Iran sun sauya irin karfin gwiwan da suke da shi, sai Allah Madaukakin Sarki ya sauya musu yanayinsu: ""Lalle ne Allah ba ya canja abin da yake ga mutane sai sun canja abin da yake ga zukatansu"" (Suratur Ra'ad 13:11)."	"the people of iran have changed the kind of power they have, but god almighty has changed their condition: ""indeed, allah will not change what is with a people until they change what is within themselves"" (surah ra'ad 13:11)."
398	[The Holy Quran, 13: 11] The people of Iran reformed their path, their movement and their motives and Allah the Exalted helped and supported them.	Al'ummar Iran sun gyara hanyarsu da tafarkin da kumajinsu, Allah Madaukakin Sarki kuma sai ya taimaka musu da kuma goya musu baya.	the people of iran have improved their ways and thoughts, allah the almighty king and may he help them and also guide them.
399	What was the result?	Mene ne sakamakon hakan?	what is the result of this?
400	There are many lessons that our dear youth should learn from the dependence of the taghuti Pahlavi regime - which is was even worse than the reactionary and disgraced Qajar regime - on England and subsequently on America.	Akwai abubuwa da yawa da ya kamata matasanmu su sani dangane da dogaro irin wanda gwamnatin dagutu ta Pahlawi - wanda ya fi na lokacin mulkin Kajar muni - ta yi da Ingila daga baya kuma da Amurka.	there are many things that our youth should know about trust, like the one the pahlawi government - which was more prevalent during the kajar rule - had with england and later with america.
401	Their dependence had reached a disgraceful level.	Wannan dogaro na su dai ya kai matsayin abin kunya.	this confidence of theirs has indeed reached the level of shamelessness.
402	After the Revolution, an outstanding American diplomat mentioned the same thing in his writings. He said that it was the Americans who used to tell the Shah what he needed and what he did not need.	Bayan nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci, daya daga cikin fitattun jami'an diplomasiyyar Amurka ya fadi da kuma rubuta cewa: Mu din nan ne muke gaya masa (Shah) cewa abubuwan da ya ke bukatar da kuma wadanda ba ya bukata.	after the successful overthrow of the islamic regime, one of the distinguished american diplomats said and wrote: we are the ones who told him (the shah) what he needed and what he did not need.
403	It was the Americans who used to tell him with whom to establish relations and with whom not to.	Su ne suke gaya masa cewa wajibi ne ka kulla alaka kaza, alaka kaza kuwa ka kwance ta.	they are the ones telling him that it is his responsibility to maintain one relationship, one relationship that you have neglected.
404	It was the Americans who used to tell him to whom he should sell oil and to whom he should not.	Ganga kaza za ku samar na man fetur, ku sayar da kaza; ga wa za ku sayar, sannan kada ku sayar ga wane.	you will provide chicken for breakfast, sell chicken; see who you will sell to, then don't sell to anyone.
405	That dependent country transformed into an independent and proud country.	To irin wannan kasar da ta dogara da wasu, sai ga shi an mayar da ita zuwa ga kasa mai ‘yanci sannan kuma madaukakiya.	for a country like this that depends on others, it has been turned into a country that respects freedom and also dignity.
406	Corrupt, treasonous and materialistic rulers, who were immersed in their carnal desires and human passions, were in charge of our country. They were replaced by representatives of the people.	Wadansu lalatattun shugabanni, maciya amana, masu bautar kudi da kuma sha'awarsu ta abin duniya ne suke mulkin kasar nan, amma sai aka sauya su da wakilan al'umma.	some of these prominent leaders, who are trusted, wealthy and have a passion for worldly things, are in charge of this country, but they have been replaced with representatives of the people.
407	They were replaced by officials who had been elected by the people.	Aka sauya su da jami'ai da jama'a suka zabe su.	they were replaced with universities and the community voted for them.
408	In the past thirty-something years, the individuals who have assumed power in our country and taken control of our policies and economy, have been representatives of the people.	Tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da wani abin, masu mulkin kasar nan da kuma gudanar da lamurran tattalin arziki da siyasa na kasar nan, wakilai ne na al'umma.	during these thirty years or so, those in power and those running the economic and political affairs of this country are representatives of the people.
409	They did not line their own pockets after assuming power, which is a very important point. Of course, some of them were more pious than others.	Ba su bude aljihun nansu (don satar kudaden al'umma ba) a lokacin da suka dare karagar mulki - na'am wasu sun fi wasu - lalle wannan lamari ne mai muhimmanci.	they did not open their treasury (for public funds) when they dared to seize power - yes some are more than others - indeed this matter is important.
410	Those evil, dependent and greedy politicians who were submissive against the enemies and treated the people in an angry way, were replaced by representatives of the people. Our scientifically backward country transformed into a country that was advanced in terms of science.	Wadannan lalatattun ‘yan siyasa masu mika kai a gaban makiya da kuma nuna fushinsu a kan mutane, sun mayar da kansu wakilan jama'a. Wannan kasa ta mu da ta ci baya a fagen ilimi, an mayar da ita ta zamanto kasa ma'abociyar ci gaba a fagen ilimi.	these prominent politicians who lead women and also express their distrust in people, have made themselves representatives of the community. this country of ours that has fallen behind in education, has been turned into a country with a dismal future in education.
411	Before the Revolution, we had not made any scientific achievements in the country.	Kafin nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci, ba mu da wata nasara da ci gaba a fagen ilimi a kasar nan.	before the success of the islamic revolution, we had no progress in the field of education in this country.
412	Is this an insignificant achievement?	Shin wannan karamin abu ne?	is this a small thing?
413	International scientific centers predict that in a few years - by the year 2017 - Iran will rank fourth in the world in terms of science.	Cibiyoyin kididdigar na duniyaay suna fadin cewa zuwa shekaru masu zuwa - zuwa shekara ta 2017 - Iran za ta kai matsayi na hudu na ilimi a duniya.	world educational institutions are saying that by the coming years - up to the year 2017 - iran will reach the fourth rank in education in the world.
414	Is this an insignificant accomplishment?	Shin wannan karamin abu ne?	is this a small thing?
415	Our country, which had made no scientific achievements, has achieved this position. There was a time we had to ask foreigners to send their engineers to our country to build dams, roads and factories for us whenever we needed a road, a highway, a dam or a factory.	Mu din nan mun kasance wata kasa ce wacce idan har muna son mu gina hanya, ko babban titi ko madatsar ruwa ko wani kamfani, to wajibi ne mu mika hannuwanmu ga wasu, don injiniyoyi daga waje su zo su gina mana wannan madatsar ruwar, su gina mana hanya da kuma wani kamfani.	we here are a country that if we want to build a road, or a major highway or a large dam or a company, it is our duty to extend our hands to others, to bring engineers from abroad to come and build us this large dam, to build us a road and also a company.
416	Today Iranian youth are building thousands of factories and hundreds of dams, bridges, roads and highways in the country without receiving the slightest help from foreigners.	Amma a yau matasan wannan al'ummar, ba tare da komai kashin dogaro da waje ba, sai ga shi suna gina dubban kamfanoni, daruruwan madatsan ruwa da hanyoyi da gadoji a kasar nan.	but today's youth of this nation, without any fear or favor, are building various companies, large water bodies and roads and bridges in this country.
417	Would it be appropriate if we ignored these things?	Shin ya dace a ce mu rufe idanuwanmu kan dukkanin wadannan abubuwan?	is it right to say we should close our eyes to all these things?
418	In areas relating to health and medicine, Iranian patients who had the money had to travel to Europe for slightly complicated operations, and those who did not have the money had to die.	A fagen kiwon lafiya da magunguna, saboda dan wani karamin ciwo ko aikin tiyata, wajibi ne marasa lafiyanmu su tafi asibitocin kasashen Turai, idan suna da kudi kenan, idan kuwa ba su da shi, to sai dai su mutu.	in the field of health and medicine, because of a minor illness or surgical operation, it is necessary for our unhealthy people to go to european hospitals, if they have the money, if not, they just have to die.
419	Today the most complicated operations - liver transplants, lung transplants and important things in other medical areas - are being carried out in our country, not just in Tehran but in many distant cities across the country.	Amma a yau a kasar mu ana gudanar da mafi rikitarwar ayyukan tiyata irin su dashen hanta ko huhu da sauran ayyukan tiyata masu muhimmanci da kuma girma. Ba wai kawai a Tehran ba, da dama daga cikin sauran garuruwa ma ana yi.	but today in our country, we are conducting the most significant theatre activities such as comedy or drama and other important and large theatre works. not only in tehran, but it is also being done in many other cities.
420	The Iranian nation does not need foreigners in this area.	Al'ummar Iran dai ba ta bukatar wasu ‘yan waje a wannan fagen.	the people of iran do not need foreigners at this stage.
421	Our nation has achieved independence and self-sufficiency in this vital area.	Mun kai matsayin dogaro da kanmu a wannan bangare mai matukar muhimmanci.	we have taken a position of trust and responsibility in this extremely important sector.
422	Many parts of this country had been ignored.	A wancan lokacin an yi watsi da da dama daga cikin yankunan kasar nan.	at that time, many regions of this country were ignored.
423	Before the Revolution, I used to travel to different places across the country.	Kafin nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci na ziyarci garuruwa da kauyuka masu yawa na kasar nan, babu komai kashin kula da ake ba wa yankunan karkara.	before the success of spreading the state of islam visited many towns and villages in this country, there was nothing like the care given to these regions.
424	However, different services are being offered in different parts of the country, including remote towns and villages.	To amma a yau din nan kan ana ci gaba da yin hidima daban-daban a duk fadin kasar nan, a garuruwan da suke nesa da kuma kauyuka daban-daban.	however, today in this country, various services are being continued in all parts of the country, in distant towns and different villages.
425	Today nobody can say that a particular area does not have electricity or roads and other such things.	A yau babu wani da zai iya cewa waje kaza ba su da wutan lantarki ko kuma a matsayin misali hanyoyi da sauransu.	today, there is no one who can say that they do not have access to electricity or as an example, roads and others.
426	Today the opposite is surprising. At that time, our population was 35 million and there were 150,000 university students in the country.	A wancan lokacin kafin nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci adadin mutanen kasar mutane miliyan talatin da biyar ne, a lokacin daliban jami'a su dubu dari da hamsin ne.	at that time before the success of the islamic revolution, the population of the country was thirty-five million, and the number of university students was one hundred and fifty thousand.
427	Today our population has increased a hundred percent, but the number of our university students has increased by 20, even 30 times.	A yau adadin mutanen ya ninka sau biyu, amma adadin daliban jami'a ya ninka sau ashirin, kai zuwa sau talatin ma.	today, the number of people has doubled, but the number of university students has increased twenty times, even up to thirty times.
428	The number of students, professors and universities in the country is remarkable.	Yawan daliban jami'a yana nufin yawan malamai da jami'oi.	the number of university students implies the number of lecturers and universities.
429	In every remote town, there are one, two, five and sometimes ten universities.	A kowane gari da ke nesa a kan sami jami'a guda, a wani wajen ma biyu, biyar, kai wani wajen ma goma.	in every distant city, you can find at least one university, in some places two, five, even ten in some places.
430	At that time, there were certain provinces in which the number of high schools was less than ten.	A wancan lokacin akwai wata jihar ma da adadin makarantun sakandare ba su kai yawan yatsun hannu ba.	at that time, there was a state with a number of secondary schools that did not reach many in number.
431	Today in every city of the same provinces, there are several universities.	Amma a yau a wannan jihar, a kowane birnin cikinta akan sami jami'oi a ciki.	but today in this state, in every city within it, universities can be found.
432	This is a great movement by the people of Iran which is the result of the Revolution and selfless efforts of Iranian youth and government officials over the past thirty-something years.	Wannan shi ne gagarumin yunkurin al'ummar Iran albarkacin wannan juyi da kuma himmar matasa da jami'anmu. Hakan abubuwa ne da suka faru tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da wani abu.	this is a great effort by the people of iran in support of this movement and also the aspirations of our youth and scholars. these are things that have happened over the past thirty years and more.
433	These are important developments.	Wadannan abubuwa ne masu muhimmanci.	these things are important.
434	Thanks to the Revolution, many infrastructure-related projects were carried out in the country. Thousands of factories were built. Many mother companies were built.	Albarkacin wannan juyi, an gudanar da ayyuka masu muhimmanci kuma na asasi a kasar nan. An samar da dubban kamfanoni a kasar nan.	due to this development, important tasks have been carried out and are fundamental in this country. several companies have been established in this country.
435	The products which we had to beg for and buy in small amounts from foreigners are being mass produced in the country today.	Kayayyakin da a da cikin bara da kankan da kai muke sawo su daga kasashen waje, amma a yau sai ga shi ana kera su da yawa a kasar nan.	the goods that we import from foreign countries, including bags and shoes, are abundant in this country, but today we see them being produced in large quantities here.
436	It is necessary to see these things.	Wajibi ne a kalli wadannan abubuwan.	it is necessary to look at these things.
437	All of these things are the blessings of the three beliefs that Imam (r.a.) instilled into our nation: faith in God, faith in the people and faith in oneself.	An samu wadannan abubuwan ne albarkacin wadannan yarda da kuma imani guda uku da Imam ya sanya su cikin zukatan al'ummar kasar, wato imani da Allah, imani da mutane da kuma yarda da kai.	these things were obtained through the blessings of these beliefs and the three faiths that the imam instilled in the hearts of the people of the country, namely faith in allah, faith in people, and self-confidence.
438	I am not saying these things in order to create a false sense of pride and happiness.	Ba wai muna fadin wadannan maganganu ne don jiji da kai na karya ya taso mana ba, mu ji dadi da farin ciki ba.	we are not saying these words to deceive or lie to you, we are genuinely happy and satisfied.
439	No, there is still a long way to go.	A'a, har ya zuwa yanzu akwai babban aiki a gabanmu.	no, until now there is a big task ahead of us.
440	I would say that if we compare our conditions with the era of taghut, these achievements will look remarkable, but we will realize that we have a long way to go if we compare our conditions with the conditions of an ideal Islamic Iran - namely, a country which Islam wants us to have, a society that Islam wants us to have, a society in which there is worldly pride and welfare as well as religious faith, ethics and spirituality, all in abundance.	Ina son in sanar da ku cewa; idan har muka kwatanta kanmu da lokacin dagutu, to lalle za a iya ganin irin wannan nasarar a fili. To amma idan har muka kwatanta kanmu da irin abin da Musulunci yake son ganin, wato irin kasa da kuma al'ummar da Musulunci yake son gani; wato al'ummar da a cikinta akwai daukaka ta duniya, jin dadi na duniya, haka nan kuma da imani da kyawawan halaye da tsoron Allah; to lalle kan akwai tazara sosai a tsakaninmu.	i want to inform you that; if we compare ourselves to the time of ignorance, it is clear that we can see this kind of success in the open. but if we compare ourselves to what islam wants to see, that is, the kind of society and community that islam wants to see; a community in which there is worldly dignity, worldly pleasure, as well as faith, good morals, and fear of god; then it is clear that there is a great difference between us.
441	I am saying these things so that our dear youth and our courageous nation realize that they can continue this path by relying on the three beliefs that I spoke about.	Ina fadin hakan ne saboda al'ummarmu masu girma da kuma jaruntaka su san cewa za a samu nasarar ci gaba da bin wannan tafarkin ne ta hanyar riko da wadannan imani guda ukun.	i am saying this because our large community and followers should know that success in propagating this ideology is through associating with these ten faiths.
442	You should know that there is a long way to go, but you have the capability.	Su san cewa lalle akwai doguwar hanya a gaba; to amma za ku iya, kuna da karfin hakan da kuma damar hakan.	they know that indeed there is a long way ahead; but you can, you have the strength and the opportunity for it.
443	You can continue traversing this long path at a high speed until you reach the peaks in a powerful way.	Lalle za ku iya ci gaba da bin wannan doguwar hanyar har zuwa ga wannan kololuwar inda ake son isa gare shi.	indeed, you can continue on this long path until you reach this roundabout where you want to get to.
444	I am saying these things so that you realize that the enemies who want to create despair in our hearts are acting out of spite.	Ina fadin wadannan kalmomi ne saboda ku san cewa kokarin makiya na sanya yanke kauna a cikin zukatanmu, suna yin hakan ne saboda kiyayya.	i am saying these words because i want you to know that women's efforts to instill love in our hearts are done out of sincerity.
445	The roadmap lies in front of our eyes.	Taswirar hanyar dai tana a gabanmu.	the picture of the road is in front of us.
446	We have a roadmap.	Muna da taswirar hanya.	we have a road map.
447	What is this roadmap?	Mece ce taswirar hanyarmu?	who is our guide?
448	Imam's principles are clear principles. Fortunately, his statements and writings have been made available to our people in the form of twenty-something volumes [of Imam Khomeini's speeches] and the main points have been presented in his testament.	Wannan koyarwar, ita ce koyarwar da a ci gaba da tafiya za ta taimaka mana da kuma ci gaba da ayyana mana taswirar hanyarmu. Koyarwar Imam dai a fili take. Abin farin cikin shi ne cewa jawaban Imam da rubuce-rubucensa suna nan a tattare da mu cikin mujalladai ashirin da wani abu.	this teaching, it is the teaching that will help us continue to travel and also continue to show us our path. the teaching of imam is in the open. the joy in it is that the answers of imam and his writings are here with us in twenty volumes and something else.
449	I believe it is not advisable to keep mentioning the name of Imam (r.a.) but let his principles sink into oblivion. This is wrong.	Ni dai bana ganin wani amfani cikin mu yi riko da sunan Imam, amma kuma mu mance da koyarwarsa. Lalle wannan kuskure ne.	i don't see any benefit in us associating with the name imam, but we also ignore his teachings. surely this is a mistake.
450	Imam (r.a.) gave this roadmap to us.	Taswirar hanyar tana tare da Imam, sannan shi kuma ya gabatar mana da ita.	the picture of the road is with the imam, and then he also presented it to us.
451	As far as foreign policy is concerned, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require that we put up a resistance against interventionist and domineering policies, that we establish brotherly relations with other Muslim nations, that we develop relations with all countries except the ones that have drawn their swords against the Iranian nation and are being hostile, that we fight Zionism, that we resist in order to liberate Palestine, that we help oppressed people throughout the world and that we put up a resistance against oppressors.	Dangane da siyasar waje kuwa, koyarwar Imam ita ce: tsayin daka wajen fada da siyasar tsoma baki na ‘yan mulkin mallaka; kulla ‘yan'uwantaka da al'ummomin musulmi; kulla alaka da dukkanin kasashen duniya, in ban da kasashen da suka zare takubbansu a kan al'ummar Iran da nuna musu kiyayya; fada da sahyoniyanci; gwagwarmaya wajen ‘yanto kasar Palastinu; taimakon wadanda aka zalunta na duniya da kuma tsayin daka a gaban azzalumai.	regarding foreign policy, imam's teaching is: stand up for the oppressed and the rights of the nations; take care of your muslim brothers and sisters; maintain relationships with all countries of the world, except those who have shown enmity towards the iranian nation and have shown them hostility; stand against zionism; sympathize with the people of palestine; help those who have been wronged in the world and also stand up against oppressors.
452	Imam's testament is available to us.	Wasiyyar Imam dai tana tare da mu.	imam's will is with us.
453	His writings and statements have been recorded and are available in the form of books. Regarding culture, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require rejection of the permissive Western culture, rejection of rigidity and reactionary attitudes, rejection of hypocrisy in religion, decisive defense of ethics and Islamic commands, and fighting the spread of immorality and corruption in society.	Hakan nan kuma jawabai da rubuce-rubucensa, wadanda aka tattara su cikin littafa, suna tare da mu. A fagen al'adu, koyarwar Imam ita ce: nesantar al'adu na lalata da shedanci na kasashen yammaci; kore daskarewa ta tunani da kuma kore aikata riya cikin riko da addini; goyon baya dari bisa dari ga kyawawan halaye da kuma hukunce-hukuncen Musulunci; da kuma fada da yada fasadi da alfasha cikin al'umma.	this, and his answers and writings, which were compiled in a book, are with us. in the field of customs, imam's teaching is: the necessity of customs is to spoil and satan's in the winter countries; the abolition of thought and also the abolition of acting hypocritically in religion and society; supporting one hundred to one hundred for clear facts and also islamic rulings; and also speaking and spreading corruption and immorality in the community.
454	As for economic matters, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require relying on the national economy, relying on self-sufficiency, ensuring economic justice in production and distribution, defending underprivileged people and confronting the capitalist culture coupled with respect for ownership rights. Imam (r.a.) rejected the oppressive capitalist culture, but he also stressed the need for respecting ownership and property rights, capital and labor.	A fagen tattalin arziki ma, koyarwar Imam ita ce: dogaro da tattalin arziki na kasa; dogaro da kai da abin da ake da shi a cikin gida; adalci na tattalin arziki cikin abubuwan da ake samarwa da kuma raba su; goyon bayan marasa abin hannu; fada da al'adar ‘yan jari hujja da kuma girmama mallaka - ta hada wadannan biyun ne - Imam ya yi watsi da al'adar zalunci da ‘yan jari hujja, to amma kuma yana mai girmama hakkin mallaka da zuba jari da kuma aiki.	in the field of economics, imam's teaching is: trust in the economy of the country; trust in oneself and what one has at home; fairness in the economy in the things that are produced and also distributed; support for the have-nots; speaking out and the tradition of the tax payers and also respecting the rights of the owners - he combined these two - imam has discarded the tradition of oppression and tax payers, but he also respects the rights of the owners and paying taxes and working.
455	Also, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require that we resist melting into the global economy and that we preserve independence of our national economy.	Haka nan kuma koyarwar Imam ta bukace mu da mu ki amincewa da narkewa cikin tattalin arzikin duniya; da kuma cewa wajibi ne mu kiyaye ‘yancin kai cikin tattalin arziki na kasa.	thus, imam's teaching also urged us to accept and be content with our lot in the world's economy; and also to say that it is our duty to maintain self-respect within the country's economy.
456	The Iranian nation can bridge the gap between current conditions and those ideal conditions by following this roadmap, by relying on their firm religious faith, by remembering their Imam (r.a.).	Al'ummar Iran za ta iya rage irin wannan tazarar da ake da ita ne ta hanyar riko da wannan taswirar hanyar da tsayayyen imani da kuma tunawa da Imaminta mai girma (r.a).	the people of iran will be able to reduce this kind of suffering by adhering to this picture through firm faith and also remembering their great imam (r.a).
457	The Iranian nation can move forward.	Al'ummar Iran za ta iya ci gaba.	the population of iran will be able to continue.
458	Considering its capabilities and talent and the outstanding individuals who are thankfully present among our people, the Iranian nation can continue the revolutionary path that we have been following over the past thirty-something years with more power and firmer determination. By Allah's favor, our nation will be able to become a genuine role model for other Muslim nations.	Bisa la'akari da irin karfi da kuma kwarewar da take da ita, haka nan kuma da irin fitattun mutanen da muke da su, al'ummar Iran za ta iya ci gaba da bin tafarkin da aka riga da aka shata tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da wani abin na wannan juyi, sannan kuma insha Allahu ta zamanto abar koyi na hakika ga sauran al'ummomin musulmi.	considering the strength and sophistication it possesses, and the kind of brilliant people we have, the iranian nation will be able to continue the thought that has been woven and sung over these thirty years, something of this nature, and then god willing, it will become a real lesson for the rest of the muslim nations.
459	Now let me speak about the elections, which is a sensitive and current issue these days.	Amma dangane da batun zabe wanda shi ne zancen da ke yawo a halin yanzu.	but regarding the election issue which is the current topic of discussion.
460	Dear brothers and sisters and dear people of Iran, elections are the manifestation of all the three beliefs of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and we should have faith in the same things.	Ya ku ‘yan'uwana maza da mata! Ya ku al'ummar Iran masu girma!	greetings to my brothers and sisters! greetings to the great people of iran!
461	Elections are the manifestation of faith in God, because taking part in elections is a religious obligation.	Zabe alama ce ta dukkanin wadannan imani guda uku da suke tare da Imam wanda kuma wajibi ne su kasance tare da mu: wato alama ce ta imani da Allah, don kuwa wani taklifi ne.	voting is a sign of all these three faiths that are with the imam and it is also obligatory for them to be with us: that is, a sign of faith in allah, so it is a burden.
462	It is our responsibility to play a role in the destiny of our country.	Nauyin da ke wuyanmu ne, takalifinmu mu tsoma baki cikin makomar kasarmu.	the burden that is on our necks, we have to bear it within the borders of our country.
463	Everybody in our country has this responsibility.	Daidaikun mutanen Iran suna da wannan nauyin a wuyansu.	the people of iran have this burden on their shoulders.
464	Elections are the manifestation of faith in the people, because the will of the people manifests itself in the form of elections: it is the people who choose government officials through elections.	Haka nan kuma alama ce ta yarda da mutane, don kuwa zabe alama ce ta iradar mutane, don kuwa mutane ne suke zaban jami'an gwamnati ta hanyar zaben.	this is also a sign of agreeing with people, because voting is a sign of people's opinion, because it is the people who express the government's opinion through voting.
465	Elections are the manifestation of having faith in oneself, because anybody who casts his vote into the ballot box feels that he is playing a role in the destiny of the country and that his role is determining in its own right.	Har ila yau alama ce ta yarda da kai, don kuwa duk mutumin da ya jefa kuri'arsa cikin akwatin zabe, zai ji cewa lalle ya ba da tasa gudummawar wajen ayyana makomar kasar nan; ya taka tasa rawar.	at least today is a sign that you have agreed with yourself, because every person who casts his vote in the ballot box, will feel that he has indeed contributed to shaping the future of this country; he has played his part.
466	This is a very important point.	Hakan wani lamari ne mai matukar muhimmanci.	this is a matter of great importance.
467	Therefore, elections are the manifestation of faith in God, faith in the people and faith in oneself.	A saboda haka zabe alama ce ta yarda da Allah, haka nan alama ce ta yarda da mutane, kamar yadda kuma alama ce ta yarda da kai.	therefore, voting is a sign of agreeing with god, likewise it is a sign of agreeing with people, just as it is a sign of agreeing with yourself.
468	Every vote that you cast into the ballot box for any of the eight honorable candidates is a vote for the Islamic Republic.	Duk wata kuri'ar da za ku kada wa daya daga cikin ‘yan takaran nan - wato wadannan mutane takwas din da suke fage - kun kada ne ga Jamhuriyar Musulunci.	every vote you deny to any of these candidates - that is, these insignificant people who are standing - you are denying to the islamic republic.
469	A vote for any of the candidates is a vote for the Islamic Republic: it is a vote of confidence for the [political] system and its electoral mechanism.	Kada kuri'a ga kowane guda daga cikin ‘yan takaran nan, kada kuri'a ce ga Jamhuriyar Musulunci; kuri'ar yarda da wannan tsari da kuma ayyukan zaben ne.	one vote for each of these candidates, one vote for the islamic republic; the vote is an agreement with this system and the election process.
470	When you enter the arena of elections - either as a voter or as a candidate - your mere presence in this arena means that you have confidence in the Islamic Republic and in our electoral mechanism.	Shi kansa shiga fagen zaben, shin wadanda suka tsaya takaran shugaban kasar ne ko kuma wadanda suke zaben ne - wato ni da ku - , shi kansa yarda da Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma yadda ake gudanar da zaben ne.	he himself entered the election arena, whether those who stood for the presidency or those who vote - that is me and you -, he himself agreed with the islamic republic and how the election is conducted.
471	On a less important level, your presence results in a vote for the person whom you consider as more valuable for the future of the country than the other candidates.	Sannan a mataki na biyu ne batun kada wa dan takaran da ko ku din nan ko kuma wannan dan'uwa ko wancan ‘yar'uwar ko kuma ni din nan zan zaba don ya zamanto mai amfani ga kasar nan sama da sauran ‘yan takaran.	then the second issue is not to give this candidate or any of you or this person or that girl or even me the vote to become useful to this country and the rest of the candidates.
472	Our helpless foreign enemies are thinking of a way to turn this election into a threat against the Islamic Republic. This is while an election is a great opportunity for the Islamic Republic.	Makiyanmu a waje, wadannan marasa mafita, suna ta tunanin yadda za su sanya wannan zaben ya zamanto barazana ga wannan tsarin na Musulunci; alhali kuwa zabe wata gagarumar dama ce ga tsarin Musulunci.	our women abroad, these helpless ones, are thinking about how they will make this election become a threat to this system of islam; whereas the election is a great opportunity for the system of islam.
473	They are hoping for a cold and lifeless election so that they can say the people are not interested in the Islamic Republic or they can create a fitna after the election, just as they did in the year 1388 after that enthusiastic election.	Fatansu shi ne ko dai a gudanar da zaben ba tare da armashi ba, don su sami damar cewa mutane sun kosa da tsarin Musulunci; ko kuma su haifar da fitina a lokacin zaben, kamar yadda ya faru a shekara ta 2009.	their aim is either to conduct the election without any interference, so that people can say they have deviated from the islamic system; or to cause chaos during the election, as happened in 2009.
474	These are what the enemies of our nation are after.	Wannan shi ne abin da makiyan wannan al'umma suke fatan gani.	this is what the farmers of this community hope to see.
475	"They do not know our people. The enemies of our nation have forgotten the 9th of Dey. Those who think that in our country there is a silent majority who are opposed to the Islamic Republic, have forgotten that over the past thirty-four years massive numbers of people have taken to the streets every year on the 22nd of Bahman in different cities of our country in order to support the Islamic Republic and shout ""death to America""."	To amma lalle kuskure suke yi, lalle ba su san al'ummarmu ba. makiyan wannan al'umma sun mance da ranar 9 ga watan Dey (30 Disambar 2009 - lokacin da al'ummar Iran suka fito don nuna goyon bayansu ga tsarin Musulunci bayan fitinar shekara ta 2009 bayan zaben shugaban kasa) ne. Mutanen da suke zaton cewa mafi yawan al'ummar kasar nan suna adawa da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci, sun mance da cewa shekaru 34 kenan a kowace shekara a ranar 22 ga watan Bahman, miliyoyin mutane ne suke fitowa a garuruwa daban-daban don nuna goyon bayansu ga Jamhuriyar Musulunci sanann kuma suna fadin ‘Allah Ya La'anci Amurka'.	however, they are making a big mistake, they do not know our people. the people of this nation ignored the 9th of dey (30th december 2009 - the time when the iranian people came out to show their support for the islamic system after the end of the year 2009 after the presidential election). the people who think that most of the population of this country are against the islamic republic, ignored that for 34 years every year on the 22nd of bahman, millions of people come out in different cities to show their support for the islamic republic and also say 'god curse america'.
476	In order to make our elections lifeless, their think tanks constantly produce ideas and feed them to their media and their spokesmen.	Don su rage kaifin wannan zaben, sun tsara wasu masanansu da za su ta maganganu ta hanyar wadannan kafafen watsa labaran.	they have reduced the budget for this election, they have planned some of their experts who will speak through these news outlets.
477	One day they say our elections have been engineered, another day they say our elections are not free, yet another day they say our elections are not legitimate in the eyes of the people.	A wani lokaci su fadi cewa zaben ma dai an riga da an tsara shi, a wani lokacin su ce babu ‘yanci cikin zaben, a wani lokaci su ce zaben ba shi da halalci a idon jama'a.	at times they say that the election has already been rigged, at other times they say there is no fairness in the election, at times they say the election is not legitimate in the eyes of the public.
478	They do not know our people, neither do they know our elections and the Islamic Republic.	A'a, ba su san mutanenmu ba ne, haka nan ba su san zabenmu ba, haka nan ba su fahimci tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci ba.	no, they don't know our people, they don't know our vote, they don't understand the system of the islamic republic.
479	Does it exist in capitalist countries?	Akwai hakan a kasashen ‘yan jari hujja?	is there such a thing in the countries of the rich people?
480	In capitalist countries, if candidates are members of the existing two or three parties and enjoy the support of capitalists, company owners, wealthy people and mafias of wealth and power, they can campaign and if not, they cannot even campaign.	A kasashen ‘yan jari hujja, idan har kai din nan ba dan daya daga cikin wadannan jam'iyyu biyu ko uku ba ne sannan kuma ba ka da goyon bayan ‘yan jari hujja da da kamfanoninsu da masu kudinsu da suka mamaye komai, ne kawai za ka iya yin yakin neman zabe.	in democratic countries, if you are not a member of one of these two or three parties and also you do not support the democratic people with their companies and their money that control everything, then you can only wage a struggle for election.
481	There were certain individuals who did not enjoy the support of the Zionists and blood-thirsty international capitalist networks, and they could not enter the arena of election no matter how hard they tried.	Akwai wasu mutane wadanda ba su da goyon bayan sahyoniyawa, ba sa da goyon bayan ‘yan jari hujja masu shan jinin al'ummomin duniya, duk abin da suka yi, ba za su iya shiga fagen zabe ba.	there are some people who do not support zionism, do not support capitalists who exploit the blood of the world's people, whatever they do, they will not be able to enter the electoral process.
482	They neither had access to a media outlet, nor were any TV channels available to them.	Ba su da kafafen watsa labarai tare da su, haka nan ba su da gidajen talabijin din da za su watsa musu shirye-shiryensu.	they don't have radio stations to broadcast their news, likewise they don't have television stations to broadcast their programs.
483	For every second of campaigning, they had to spend huge amounts of money.	Saboda haka wani irin kudi ne za su kashe wajen watsa shirye-shiryensu na dakika guda.	therefore, they will spend some kind of money on broadcasting their one-minute programs.
484	In our country, candidates are given equal opportunities to speak to the people for many hours through state media without having to spend one single rial.	A kasarmu ‘yan takara ba tare da sun kashe ko sisi ba, za a ba su sa'oi masu yawa su isar da sakonnin da suke da shi ga mutane.	in our country, candidates do not campaign without spending money, they will be given a lot of time to deliver their messages to the people.
485	In which part of the world do such things exist?	A ina ne ake samun irin wannan yanayin a duk fadin duniya?	where can one find this kind of situation in any part of the world?
486	The only thing that controls entry into our elections is the law.	Abin da ke da iko a fagen zabe shi ne kawai doka.	the only thing that has power in the election process is the law.
487	According to the law, some people can run in our elections and some others cannot.	Bisa doka ce wasu za su iya shigowa fagen zaben, wasu kuma ba za su iya shigowa ba.	some will be able to enter the voting stage through the ladder, while others will not be able to enter.
488	The law has specified what the conditions are, what the qualifications are and who are in charge of vetting.	Doka ta ayyana sharuddan da ake son cikawa, wato su waye suka cancanci tsayawa.	the law reveals the conditions that need to be met, that is, who they preferred to stay.
489	All of these things are being done on the basis of the law.	Ana gudanar da dukkanin hakan ne bisa doka.	all of this is being done according to the law.
490	Our foreign enemies close their eyes to these realities and say certain things, and as I have pointed out before, sadly there are impious people who repeat the same things.	Wadannan makiyan suna zaune a wani gefe can su rufe idanuwansu kan dukkanin wadannan abubuwa. Suna ta fadin maganganu. Kamar yadda na sha fadi, abin bakin cikin shi ne sai a sami wasu mutane marasa tsoron Allah suna ci gaba da nanata wadannan maganganun da suke fadi.	these owls are perched on a branch over there, closing their eyes to all these things. they are speaking. as i said, the sad thing is that some people who are not afraid of god continue to nurture these words they are saying.
491	But by Allah's favor and with their presence, resistance and firm determination, our people will respond to all these machinations and their response will be crushing and decisive.	To amma al'ummar Iran cikin yardar Allah, za su mayar wa wadannan mutane da martani ta hanyar fitowarsu da kuma irin tsayin dakan da za su yi. Sannan kuma martanin da za su mayar din wani martani ne mai ruguzarwa.	however, the people of iran in god's will, will respond to these people through their emergence and the kind of stance they will take. then the response they will give is a response that is challenging.
492	Now I would like to give a piece of advice to the honorable candidates. The honorable candidates speak critically in the televised programs. This is their right.	Bari in fadi wasu ‘yan jumloli ga ‘yan takara kuma. A yayin yakin neman zabe ‘yan takara masu girma sun yi suka kan wasu shirye-shirye na gwamnati, wannan hakkinsu ne.	let me tell some facts to the candidates. during the election campaign, the major candidates have made their claims on some government projects, this is their right.
493	However, they should pay attention to the point that criticism should signify a determination to move towards a future that is full of hard work and glory.	Suna iya yin suka kan dukkanin abubuwan da suka ga a ra'ayinsu bai yi daidai ba. To sai dai yana da kyau sukan na su ta zamanto da ma'anar yin azama da kuma niyyar gyara da kuma tabbatar da makoma mai kyau ne.	they can make mistakes on everything they see in their opinion. but it's okay, it's good their mistakes will become meaningful in making corrections and also ensuring that the future is better.
494	They should pay attention to this point. I do not favor anybody. From this moment onwards, foreign media will say with ulterior motives that I favor a particular candidate.	Wajibi ne su yi la'akari da wannan lamarin. Ni dai ba ni da wani dan takara. Daga yanzu din nan kafafen watsa labaran ‘yan kasashen waje saboda adawa da kuma bakar aniya za su fadi cewa: Ni na fi fifita wane daga cikin ‘yan takaran.	it is their duty to address this issue. i don't have any candidate. from now on, foreign media will report due to the competition and lack of experience, they will say: i outperformed one of the candidates.
495	I advise the brothers who want to win the people's trust that their comments should be fair.	Ina kiran ‘yan'uwan da suke son janyo hankulan al'umma zuwa ga re su, da su yi adalci wajen fadin maganganu.	i am calling on those who want to divert the attention of the public to their side, to be fair in their speech.
496	They can make criticisms, but in doing so, they should not paint a bleak picture and deny the outstanding achievements that have been accomplished under the incumbent administration or previous administrations thanks to the constant efforts of individuals like themselves.	Su yi suka, to amma suka ba wai da ma'anar bakanta wani ba. Kada sukar ta zamanto inkarin fitattun ayyukan da aka yi, shin a wannan gwamnatin ce ko kuma a gwamnatocin da suka gabata.	they did it, but they did not give any meaning to neglecting anyone. the sugar should not become a denial of the great deeds that have been done, is it in this government or in the previous governments.
497	Criticism does not mean denying positive aspects.	Kada sukar ta zamanto da ma'anar inkarin ayyuka masu kyau da aka yi a baya.	let the sugar not lose its meaning of refusing good deeds that were done in the past.
498	The next president will not have to start from zero: thousands of outstanding things have already been done.	A halin yanzu duk wanda ya dare karagar mulki a kasar nan ba ya bukatar ya fara aiki daga farko, don kuwa an gudanar da dubban ayyuka masu girma.	from now on, anyone who dares to overthrow the government in this country does not need to start from scratch, as many major projects have already been implemented.
499	Over the course of many years, thousands of fundamental infrastructure-related projects have been carried out in the country under different administrations.	Tsawon shekaru, a lokutan gwamnatocin daban-daban, an gudanar da ayyuka na gina kasa masu yawa.	over the years, in various government offices, many nation-building activities have been carried out.
500	They should not disregard these things.	Bai kamata a yi watsi da wadannan ba.	one should not ignore these.
501	We cannot afford to deny all this work under the pretext that we have economic problems, that we have the problem of rising prices and inflation. After all, this is not the right thing to do.	Dukkanin irin wadannan ayyukan da aka yi bai kamata don kawai ana fuskantar matsala ta tattalin arziki da tsadar kayayyaki, shi kenan sai mu yi inkarin dukkanin wadancan ayyukan ba. Lalle hakan ba daidai ba ne.	all these types of activities that have been done should not only be for the purpose of identifying economic and social problems, but we should also deny all these activities. certainly, this is not right.
502	However, this does not mean that we should deny everything that has been done in order to present a solution to the existing problems.	To amma bai kamata idan har muna da wata mafita daga wadannan matsalolin, shi kenan sai mu yi inkarin dukkanin abubuwan da a yau din nan aka aikata su ba.	however, it is necessary that if we have a solution to these problems, then we must deny all the things that have been done today.
503	Also, the candidates should not make impossible promises.	Haka nan kuma bai kamata a dinga yin alkawurran da ba za a iya cikawa ba.	that's how it is, and it's not advisable to keep making mistakes that can't be corrected.
504	You should speak in a way that if your recorded statements are replayed to you next year in Khordad, you do not feel ashamed.	Ina kiran dukkanin ‘yan takara da su fadi abubuwan da idan a shekara mai zuwa a daidai wannan lokacin aka kawo musu kasetocin maganganun da suka yi, ba za su ji kunya ba.	i am calling on all the candidates to say things that if brought to them in a year's time at this exact moment, they would not be ashamed of the speeches they made.
505	Make such promises that you would not have to blame other people under the pretext that they did not let you do what you wanted to do.	Ku yi alkawurra da idan a nan gaba aka gabatar muku da su, ba za ku dinga kame-kame da kuma kokarin dora alhakin gazawar a wuyan wannan da wancan ba.	be patient and if they are presented to you in the future, you will not continue to struggle and try to put the blame of the competition on this or that.
506	Only make promises that you will be able to fulfill.	Ku yi alkawurra ayyukan da za ku iya yi.	do the tasks that you can do.
507	In our country and according to our Constitution, the president has extraordinary powers.	A kasarmu sannan kuma bisa ga kundin tsarin mulkinmu, shugaban kasa yana da iko mai girman gaske.	in our country and also according to our system of government, the president has real power.
508	The Constitution has given vast powers to the president.	Karfin da shugaban kasa yake da shi a cikin kundin tsarin mulkinmu karfi ne mai girma da fadin gaske.	the strength that the president has within the framework of our governance is a great and genuine strength.
509	He has control over all executive pillars of the country. He has control over the implementation of the laws and regulations in the country. He has the power to utilize the capacities of all experts throughout the country.	Shugaban kasa shi ne yake da kasafin kudin kasa a hannunsa, shi ne yake da dukkanin ayyukan gudanarwa a hannunsa, shi ne yake da karfin tsara gudanar da dokoki, yana da karfin amfani da dukkanin masanan da suke fadin kasar nan.	the president is the one who holds the country's treasury, he is the one who holds all the operations in his hands, he is the one who has the power to plan and execute, he has the power to use all the scholars who speak in this country.
510	The president has room for maneuver in the case of different issues.	Hannayen shugaban kasa a bude suke cikin lamurra daban-daban.	the hands of the president are open in different kinds of problems.
511	The only thing that restricts the president in our country is the law.	Iyakan da kawai yake da ita, ita ce iyaka ta doka.	he only has problems with her, she is the source of his troubles.
512	His actions can only be restricted by the law, which is not in fact a restriction.	Doka ce kawai za ta yi masa iyaka, wanda hakan ma ba kan iyaka ba ne.	the stick will only harm him, which is not necessarily a bad thing.
513	The law provides guidance: it does not restrict.	Doka mai shiryarwa ce, ba mai takaitawa ba.	the pole is for leaning, not for uprooting.
514	Those who address the people today and say different things, should discuss what they are capable of doing and what the people need.	Mutanen da a yau suke magana da mutane, su gaya musu irin abubuwan da za su iya wadanda kuma mutane suke bukatarsu.	the people who are speaking with others today, tell them the kind of things they can do and what people need from them.
515	They should promise that they will act in a wise and prudent way.	Idan har suna da wani shiri da kuma tsari to su gaya wa mutane, su yi musu alkawurrin yin iyakacin kokarinsu wajen gudanar da wadannan tsare-tsare da kuma yin alkawurrin amfani da dukkanin karfin da doka ta ba su wajen sauke wannan gagarumin nauyin da ke wuyansu.	if they have a plan and strategy, they should tell the people, and make them the promise of exerting their utmost effort in implementing these strategies and making the promise to use all the power that the law has given them to alleviate this enormous burden that is on their necks.
516	They should promise that they will make use of all the capacities of the Constitution in order to carry out their great responsibility.	Wasu suna da tunanin na kuskure na cewa mu yi sassauci wa makiya don su rage irin fushin da suke yi da mu.	some are under the impression that we should apologize to women to reduce the kind of anger they have towards us.
517	They should promise that they will not prefer the interests of foreigners over the interests of the Iranian nation under different pretexts.	A aikace suna fifita manufofin wadancan mutane sama da manufofin kasa. Lalle wannan kuskure ne.	it is said they are blaming those people's faults more than the faults of others. indeed, this is a mistake.
518	Some people argue that we should make concessions to the enemies in order to appease them and in this way they effectively prefer the interests of the enemies over the interests of the Iranian nation. This is wrong. They are angry because you exist, because the Islamic Republic exists, because Imam (r.a.) is alive in the minds of the people and in our national plans, because the people show their feelings for Imam (r.a.) every year on his demise anniversary.	Fushin makiyan ya samo asali ne saboda kasantuwarku, saboda kasantuwar Jamhuriyar Musulunci, saboda Imam ya kasance a raye a cikin zukata da kwakwalan al'ummar kasar nan da kuma abubuwan da ake gudanarwa; saboda ranar 14 ga watan Khordad, wato ranar rasuwar Imam, saboda al'ummar Iran daga duk fadin kasar nan suna fitowa (don nuna kaunar gare shi).	the bee's sting found honey because of your endurance, because of the endurance of the islamic republic, because the imam lived among the thorns and hardships of this country's people and the events taking place; because of the 14th of khordad, which is the anniversary of the imam's death, because the people of iran from all over the country are coming out (to show their love for him).
519	These are the causes of their anger.	Wannan shi ne dalilin wannan fushi na su.	this is the reason for their anger.
520	If our nation becomes powerful and capable, if it reduces its needs, if it eliminates its problems, if it manages to improve the economy which is our main issue today, the enemy will be defenseless against the Iranian nation.	Matukar dai al'ummarmu ta tsaya da kafafunta, ta zamanto mai karfi, ta rage irin bukatar da take da ita, ta magance matsalolinta, a yau da yake batun tattalin arziki shi ne a kan gaba, ta sami damar karfafa tattalin arzikinta, to kuwa makiya ba abin da za su iya a gaban al'ummar Iran.	despite our society's dependence on it, it has become powerful, it has reduced its needs, it has solved its problems, today the issue of economic development is in the future, it has the opportunity to strengthen its economy, so women are not something that can be ignored in the development of iranian society.
521	In any case, what is important is to have determination, faith in God, faith in the people and faith in ourselves, and this applies to both the presidential candidates and the people.	Ala kulli hal, abin da ke da muhimmanci, shi ne tsayin daka da azama, imani da Allah da yarda da irin karfin da mutane suke da shi da kuma yarda da kai, shin a wajen ‘yan takaran ne ko kuma a wajen daidaikun al'umma.	in any case, what is important is the stance and determination, faith in allah and acceptance of the kind of strength that people have and also acceptance of yourself, whether in the context of elections or in the context of community interactions.
522	My dear brothers, my dear ones, there will a great test in ten days, and by Allah's favor we hope that in this great test Allah the Exalted will cause an auspicious instance of valor with brilliant outcomes for our nation.	Ya ku ‘yan'uwana masu girma! Kwanaki goma masu zuwa wani fage ne na jarabawa mai girma, ina fatan insha Allahu, a yayin wannan jarabawar mai girma al'umma za su fito kwansu da kwarkwatansu sannan daga karshe ya zamanto an sami sakamako mai kyau.	greetings to my esteemed compatriots! ten days remain to a major examination, i hope by god's grace, during this major examination, the community will come out with their full potential and eventually achieve a good result.
523	There is no power except with the permission of Great Almighty Allah.	"‘Babu wata dabara ko karfi sai daga wajen Allah Mai girma da daukaka""."	"""there is no power or might except from allah, the most high, the most great."""
524	To the Youth in Europe and North America - Khamenei.ir	Wasikar Jagora Imam Khamenei Ga Matasan Kasashen Turai Da Arewacin Amurka	letter from leader khamenei to the youth of europe and north america
525	In the name of God, the Beneficent the Merciful	Da Sunan Allah Mai Rahama Mai Jin Kai	in the name of god, the most merciful, the most compassionate
526	To the Youth in Europe and North America,	Zuwa Ga Dukkanin Matasan Kasashen Turai Da Arewacin Amurka	to all the youths of european countries and north america
527	The recent events in France and similar ones in some other Western countries have convinced me to directly talk to you about them.	Lamurrann baya-bayan nan da suka faru a kasar Faransa da makamantansu a wasu kasashen Yammaci, su ne suka sanya ni ganin ya dace in yi magana da ku kai tsaye.	the events that occurred in france and their implications in some western countries, they are what made me see it necessary to talk to you frankly.
528	I am addressing you, [the youth], not because I overlook your parents, rather it is because the future of your nations and countries will be in your hands; and also I find that the sense of quest for truth is more vigorous and attentive in your hearts.	Ina magana da ku ne, Ya ku matasa; ba wai saboda na raina iyayenku ba, face dai sai saboda ku ne manyan gobe, wadanda makomar al'umma da kuma kasarku take hannunsu; sannan kuma saboda ina ganin zukatanku cike suke da neman sanin gaskiya.	i am speaking to you, the youth; not because i despise my parents, but because you are the leaders of tomorrow, whose hands the affairs of the community and your country will be; and also because i see your hearts filled with the desire to know the truth.
529	I don't address your politicians and statesmen either in this writing because I believe that they have consciously separated the route of politics from the path of righteousness and truth.	Haka nan kuma ba wai ina magana ne da ‘yan siyasa da jami'an gwamnatocinku ba ne, don kuwa na yi amanna da cewa da gangan sannan kuma da saninsu suka kawar da siyasarsu daga tafarkin gaskiya da hakika.	that is why i am not talking about politicians and our government officials, because i have trusted that they really know and understand that they have deviated their politics from the path of truth and reality.
530	I would like to talk to you about Islam, particularly the image that is presented to you as Islam.	Magana ta da ku kan Musulunci ne, musamman ma dangane irin abin da ake gabatar muku da shi a matsayin Musuluncin.	the discussion with you is about islam, especially regarding the kind of thing that is presented to you as islam.
531	Many attempts have been made over the past two decades, almost since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, to place this great religion in the seat of a horrifying enemy.	Tsawon shekaru ashirin din da suka gabata zuwa sama - wato tun daga lokacin rugujewar Tarayyar Sobiyeti - an gudanar da gagarumin kokarin bayyanar da wannan addini mai girma a matsayin wani gagarumin abin tsoro.	the past twenty years - since the collapse of the soviet union - have seen a tremendous effort to portray this major religion as a great source of fear.
532	The provocation of a feeling of horror and hatred and its utilization has unfortunately a long record in the political history of the West.	Abin bakin cikin shi ne cewa irin wannan yanayi na sanya tsoro da kyamar (wannan addini) wani lamari ne mai tsoron tarihi cikin tarihin siyasar kasashen yammaci.	the essence of his argument is that this kind of climate instills fear and suspicion (this religious issue) is a matter of historical fear in the history of northern countries' politics.
533	Here, I don't want to deal with the different phobias with which the Western nations have thus far been indoctrinated.	Ni dai a nan ba ina so ne in yi magana dangane da ‘irin kyama da tsoratarwa' daban-daban da ya zuwa yanzu aka sanya cikin zukatan al'ummomin kasashen yammaci ba.	i am here not because i want to talk about the various 'types of suffering and persecution' that have now been imposed on the communities of the northern countries.
534	A cursory review of recent critical studies of history would bring home to you the fact that the Western governments' insincere and hypocritical treatment of other nations and cultures has been censured in new historiographies.	Idan kuka koma kadan cikin tarihi, za ku ga cewa sabbin marubuta tarihi, sun soki mu'amalar rashin adalci da gaskiya da gwamnatocin yammaci suka yi wa al'ummomi da al'adun duniya.	if you delve a little into history, you will find that new historical writers have covered the injustices and lies that past governments have done to the public and world cultures.
535	The histories of the United States and Europe are ashamed of slavery, embarrassed by the colonial period and chagrined at the oppression of people of color and non-Christians.	Tarihin Turai da Amurka ya rusunar da kansa cikin kunya saboda bautar da mutane, mulkin mallaka da kuma zaluntar wadanda ba fararen fata da kuma wadanda ba Kiristoci ba da suka yi.	the history of europe and america has shrouded itself in shame due to the enslavement of people, colonial rule, and the exploitation of those who are not white and not christians.
536	Your researchers and historians are deeply ashamed of the bloodsheds wrought in the name of religion between the Catholics and Protestants or in the name of nationality and ethnicity during the First and Second World Wars.	Masana da malaman tarihinku suna cikin kunyar irin zubar da jinin da aka yi da sunan addini tsakanin mabiya darikar Katolika da Protestant ko kuma da sunan ‘yan kasanci da kabilanci a yakukuwan duniya na daya da na biyu.	scholars and historians are in a dilemma similar to the bloodshed done in the name of religious differences between catholic and protestant followers, or in the name of ethnicity and tribalism in the first and second world wars.
537	This approach is admirable. By mentioning a fraction of this long list, I don't want to reproach history; rather I would like you to ask your intellectuals as to why the public conscience in the West awakens and comes to its senses after a delay of several decades or centuries.	Manufar bijiro da wani bangare na wannan doguwar fehrisa na abubuwan da suka faru, ba ita ce sukar tarihi ba, face dai abin da nake so shi ne ku tambayi masananku shin me ya sa a koda yaushe sai bayan jinkiri na gomomin shekaru ko kuma ma daruruwan shekaru ne lamirin al'ummomin yammaci ya ke farkawa da kuma dawowa cikin hayacinsa?	the purpose of this short essay is not to discuss the historical events that occurred, but rather what i want is to ask your experts why it always takes decades or even centuries for the cold light of morning to return and re-enter its life?
538	Why should the revision of collective conscience apply to the distant past and not to the current problems?	Me ya sa ake damfara lamirin mutane ga abubuwan da suka faru cikin tarihin shekaru aru aru ba batutuwan da suke faruwa a halin yanzu ba?	why are people's attitudes towards events that happened in history hundreds of years ago different from the events happening now?
539	Why is it that attempts are made to prevent public awareness regarding an important issue such as the treatment of Islamic culture and thought?	Me ya sa ake kange mutane daga fahimtar lamurra masu muhimmanci irin su hanyoyin mu'amala da al'adu da kuma tunani na Musulunci?	why are people prevented from understanding important issues such as ways of dealing with customs and islamic thoughts?
540	You know well that humiliation and spreading hatred and illusionary fear of the â€œotherâ€ have been the common base of all those oppressive profiteers.	Ku da kanku kun san cewa wulakanci da haifar da kiyayya da kirkirar tsoron sauran mutane na boge, suna a matsayin wani fage ne da aka yi tarayya cikinsa wajen haifar da dukkanin irin wadannan zalunci da mummunan amfani da mutane.	you and your kind know that discrimination and the creation of fear and hatred and the instigation of fear of others is a stage that has been passed in order to create all kinds of these injustices and evil uses of people.
541	Now, I would like you to ask yourself why the old policy of spreading â€œphobiaâ€ and hatred has targeted Islam and Muslims with an unprecedented intensity.	A halin yanzu ina son tambayarku, shin me ya sa yanzu aka dawo da tsohuwar siyasar sanya tsoro da kyamar Musulunci da musulmi?	currently, i want to ask you, why has the old policy of instilling fear and hatred towards islam and muslims returned?
542	Why does the power structure in the world want Islamic thought to be marginalized and remain latent?	Me ya sa tsarin mulki na duniya a halin yanzu ya sanya tunani na Musulunci a gaba?	why has the current world order placed islam in the forefront of thought?
543	What concepts and values in Islam disturb the programs of the super powers and what interests are safeguarded in the shadow of distorting the image of Islam?	Shin wasu abubuwa ne da suke cikin tunani da koyarwar Musulunci da har zai zamanto kafar ungulu ga tsare-tsare da siyasar manyan kasashen duniya, sannan kuma me za su samu wajen bakanta fuskar Musulunci?	are there some things that are in the thought and teaching of islam that will become a stumbling block to peace and politics in the major countries of the world, and then what will they get to tarnish the image of islam?
544	Hence, my first request is: Study and research the incentives behind this widespread tarnishing of the image of Islam.	A saboda haka, bukata ta ta farko ita ce ku yi tambaya da kuma binciko dalilin irin wannan gagarumin kokari na bata sunan Musulunci.	therefore, the first need is to ask and research the reason for this tremendous effort to tarnish the name of islam.
545	My second request is that in reaction to the flood of prejudgments and disinformation campaigns, try to gain a direct and firsthand knowledge of this religion.	Bukata ta ta biyu, ita ce yayin mayar da martani ga irin wannan gagarumin bakar farfagandar bata sunan Musulunci (da ake yi), ku yi kokarin fahimtar wannan addini (Musulunci) da koyarwar ta hakika kai tsaye.	the second need is during the response to this kind of small misunderstanding named islamophobia, you should strive to understand this religion (islam) and its true teachings.
546	The right logic requires that you understand the nature and essence of what they are frightening you about and want you to keep away from. I don't insist that you accept my reading or any other reading of Islam. What I want to say is: Don't allow this dynamic and effective reality in today's world to be introduced to you through resentments and prejudices.	Lafiyayyen hankali yana hukumta wajibcin sanin hakikanin abin da ake tsoratar da ku shi da kuma nesanta ku daga gare shi. Ni dai ba ina cewa ne lalle sai kun yarda da fahimta ta ko fahimtar wani kan Musulunci ba, sai dai abin da nake cewa shi ne kada ku bari a kange ku daga wannan hakikar wacce take da tasiri cikin duniyar yau saboda cimma wata bakar manufa.	a healthy mind dictates the obligation to know the truth of what you are afraid of and to protect yourself from it. i'm not saying that you must understand it from an islamic perspective, but what i'm saying is that you should not let yourself be distracted from this truth which has an impact in today's world due to achieving a certain goal.
547	Don't allow them to hypocritically introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of Islam.	Kada ku bari cikin riya su gabatar muku da ‘yan ta'addan da suke karkashin ikonsu a matsayin wakilan Musulunci.	do not let those who present you with violence under their control as representatives of islam deceive you.
548	Receive knowledge of Islam from its primary and original sources.	Kamata yayi ku fahimci Musulunci daga tushensa na asali.	he should understand islam from its original perspective.
549	Gain information about Islam through the Qur'an and the life of its great Prophet.	Ku fahimci Musulunci ta hanyar Alkur'ani da rayuwar Annabin Musulunci (tsira da amincin Allah su tabbata a gare shi da Alayensa).	understand islam through the qur'an and the life of the prophet muhammad (peace and blessings of allah be upon him and his family).
550	I would like to ask you whether you have directly read the Qur'an of the Muslims.	A nan ina son in tambaye ku, shin ya zuwa yanzu kun taba karanta Alkur'anin musulmi kai tsaye?	here i want to ask you, have you ever read the quran standing up to this point?
551	Have you studied the teachings of the Prophet of Islam and his humane, ethical doctrines?	Shin kun taba karantar koyarwar Annabin Musulunci (tsira da amincin Allah su tabbata a gare shi da Alayensa) da kyawawan halaye da ‘yan'adamtakarsa?	have you ever studied the teachings of the prophet of islam (peace and blessings of allah be upon him and his progeny) and the wonderful events and human interactions?
552	Have you ever received the message of Islam from any sources other than the media?	Shin ya zuwa yanzu kun fahimci sakon Musulunci ta wata kafa ta daban, ba kafar watsa labarai ba?	have you now understood the message of islam from a different perspective, not from the perspective of a news outlet?
553	Have you ever asked yourself how and on the basis of which values has Islam established the greatest scientific and intellectual civilization of the world and raised the most distinguished scientists and intellectuals throughout several centuries?	Shin kun taba tambayar kanku ya ya aka yi wannan Musuluncin, sannan bisa wasu koyarwa ya samu daman zama mafi girman al'adu da ci gaban ilimi da tunani na duniya sannan kuma ya tarbiyyantar da mafi girma da kyawun masana da masu tunani na duniya?	have you ever asked yourself how this islam became, and then through some teachings, managed to become the largest culture and the advancement of knowledge and thought in the world, and also nurtured the greatest and most distinguished scholars and thinkers in the world?
554	I would like you not to allow the derogatory and offensive image-buildings to create an emotional gulf between you and the reality, taking away the possibility of an impartial judgment from you.	Ina kiranku da kada ku bari a yi amfani da bakar siyasa da wauta wajen katange ku daga gaskiya, da kuma kawar da yiyuwar yin alkalanci cikin adalci daga gare ku.	i am calling on you not to allow the use of political and religious sentiment to sway you away from the truth, and also to eradicate the culture of corruption in the name of justice.
555	Today, the communication media have removed the geographical borders. Hence, don't allow them to besiege you within fabricated and mental borders.	A halin yanzu da kafafen sadarwa suka rusa ganuwar kan iyakokin kasashe, kada ku bari a kange ku cikin kirkirarrun kan iyakoki na boge.	as of now, communication networks have destroyed the boundaries between countries, do not let yourself be trapped in the narrow confines of nationalism.
556	Although no one can individually fill the created gaps, each one of you can construct a bridge of thought and fairness over the gaps to illuminate yourself and your surrounding environment.	Duk da cewa babu wani mutum, a kan kansa, da zai cike wannan gibin da aka samar, amma kowane guda daga cikinku zai iya samar da gadar tunani da adalci a kan wannan gibin da aka haifar.	even though there is no one, on his own, that can fill this void that has been created, but each one of you can contribute a thought and justice to this void that has been created.
557	While this preplanned challenge between Islam and you, the youth, is undesirable, it can raise new questions in your curious and inquiring minds.	Duk da cewa wannan kalubalen da aka kirkira tsakanin Musulunci da ku matasa wani kalubale ne mai sarkakiyar gaske, to amma hakan yana iya kirkiro sabbin tambayoyi cikin zukatanku da suke neman sanin hakika.	despite the fact that this crisis created between islam and you young people is a real serious problem, it can still raise new questions within your curiosity that seek to know the truth.
558	Attempts to find answers to these questions will provide you with an appropriate opportunity to discover new truths.	Kokari wajen samo amsoshin wadannan tambayoyi, zai samar muku da wata dama ta gano wasu sabbin gaskiyar.	effort in finding answers to these questions will provide you with an opportunity to discover some new truths.
559	Therefore, don't miss the opportunity to gain proper, correct and unbiased understanding of Islam so that hopefully, due to your sense of responsibility toward the truth, future generations would write the history of this current interaction between Islam and the West with a clearer conscience and lesser resentment.	A saboda haka, kada ku bari wannan dama ta fahimtar gaskiyar Musulunci ta kubuce muku, don me yiyuwa ta hanyar wannan jin nauyi a jika da kuke da shi, al'ummomi masu zuwa za su rubuta tarihin irin wannan mu'amala da kasashen yammaci suka yi da Musulunci cikin sauki ba tare da wahala ba.	therefore, do not let this opportunity to understand the truth of islam elude you, for what purpose is this burden on your shoulder that you carry, the coming generations will write the history of such affairs and the cold countries have done with islam easily without any trouble.

569	In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful	Da Sunan Allah Mai Rahama Mai Jin Kai	in the name of allah, the most gracious, the most merciful.
570	All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate, pure and chosen household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.	Dukkan godiya ta tabbata ga Allah Ubangijin talikai. Tsira da amincin Allah su tabbata ga Shugabanmu kuma Annabinmu Abul Kasim al-Mustafa Muhammad tare da Alayensa tsarkaka musamman ma Wanzajjen Allah a bayan kasa.	all thanks are due to allah, the lord of all the worlds. the praise and peace of allah be upon our leader and our prophet abul kasim al-mustafa muhammad and his pure family, especially the chosen ones of allah on earth.
571	I am thankful to Allah the Exalted from the bottom of my heart who gave me another opportunity to meet you dear people and youth - including the honorable people of Mashhad and the surrounding areas as well as the esteemed pilgrims who have travelled from other cities - at the spiritual shrine of Ali ibn Musa ar-Ridha (a.s.) and to enjoy the spiritual blessings of sitting in the shade of Imam Ridha (a.s.) and his holy shrine.

573	I would like to discuss a few issues with you dear brothers and sisters in this meeting.	Akwai wadansu batutuwa da nake son magana kansu a yayin wannan ganawa da ku 'yan'uwa maza da mata.	there are some issues that i want to discuss with them during this meeting with you, my brothers and sisters.
574	The first part of my speech is a brief look at the events that happened in our country in the year 1390 and at the regional and global developments that were related to us.	Batu na farko, dubi ne a gurguje cikin abubuwan da suka faru a gare mu, a kan al'ummarmu da kasarmu da kuma abubuwan da suka shafe mu a fagage na duniya da wannan yankin.	firstly, it is a look at the events that happened to us, to our community and our country, and also the things that have affected us in the world and this region.
575	The reason why I want to discuss the developments of the year 1390 - and particularly the achievements that were made by the Iranian nation last year - is that our enemies and ill-wishers are making threats against our dear nation.	Dalilin da ya sanya mu ke magana kan batutuwan da suka faru a shekarar 1390 (da ta gabata) musamman irin nasarorin da al'ummar Iran suka samu a wannan shekarar shi ne saboda irin makirce-makircen da makiya da masu bakar aniya suka ta kulla wa al'ummar Iran ne.	the reason we are discussing the events that occurred in the year 1390 (and before) especially the successes that the people of iran achieved in this year, is because of the kind of oppression and tyranny that the oppressors subjected the people of iran to.
576	The leaders of the arrogant powers, those who have power and wealth and their followers in our region are doing everything in their power - their financial, propaganda and political power - to intimidate the Iranian people and to disappoint them.	Shugabannin girman kai da masu tinkaho da kuma amfani da karfi da tursasawa da kuma 'yan amshin shatansu na wannan yanki na mu - sun yi amfani da dukkanin karfinsu, shin karfi ne na kudi, ko karfi na farfaganda da kuma na siyasa - wajen ganin sun razana al'ummar Iran da kuma sanya su yanke kauna.	the leaders of this region of ours - the bigwigs and the influential, the powerful and the wealthy, and their devilish acolytes - have used all their might, whether it's financial power, propaganda, or political power, to oppress the people of iran and to make them suffer.
577	Anybody who has followed the political propaganda of the ill-wishers of the Iranian nation realizes that all the activities, all the economic and political efforts and all the security and military threats are aimed at stopping, disappointing and intimidating the vibrant, living, dynamic, determined and capable Iranian nation, a nation that is standing firm in the middle of the arena in a totally courageous way, a nation that is moving forward.	Duk wanda ya ke bi irin farfagandar da masu bakar aniya kan al'ummar Iran suke yi, a fili zai iya ganin irin wadannan kokari na aiki, kokari na tattalin arziki da kokari na siyasa, barazana ta soji da dai sauransu da suka yi wajen ganin sun dunkufar da tsayayyiyar al'ummar Iran daga fagen ci gaba da gudanar da ayyukanta da kuma samun ci gaba, su sanya ta yanke kauna da kuma razana ta daga irin wannan kasantuwa da take da ita a fage.	anyone who closely follows the kind of determination that the iranian people have, would likely see these efforts at work, efforts in economic development and politics, the military enthusiasm and the rest of what they have done to ensure the progress and prosperity of the iranian people from the stage of progress and the implementation of its tasks and also to achieve progress, they put it to make decisions with love and also remove the kind of satisfaction it has with it in the past.
578	"In fact, aside from the slogan of ""we can"" which our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) taught us, the Revolution also gave us the courage to say, ""We can"". They want to convince us that we are incapable."	A hakikanin gaskiya suna son su fitar da wannan akida ta cewa 'lalle za mu iya' wanda mai girma Imam (Khumaini) ne ya koya mana ita sannan kuma juyin juya halin Musulunci ya ba mu karfin gwuiwan cewa lalle 'za mu iya' din daga zuciyar al'umma da cusa musu cewa lalle ku din nan ba za ku iya wani abu ba.	in truth, they want to get rid of this belief that 'indeed we can', which the great imam (khumaini) taught us, and also the turnaround of the state of islam has given us the strength of conviction that 'indeed we can' from the heart of the community, and they are telling them that indeed you people will not be able to do anything.
579	They are doing everything in their power to achieve this goal and their activities reached full swing in the year 1390.	Sun yi dukkanin kokarinsu wajen ganin sun cimma wannan manufar. Shekarar da ta gabatar ta kasance shekarar da suka kara kaimi ainun wajen cimma hakan.	they have made all their efforts to ensure they achieve this goal. the year that was presented turned out to be the year they made significant progress in achieving this.
580	I would like to stress that despite their will and much to their disappointment, in the year 1390 the Iranian nation once again convinced the enemies and the entire world - with its activities, advances and decisions - that it is capable.	Ina son kowa ya fahimci cewa cewar sabanin abin da suke fatan gani al'ummar Iran ta hanyar ci gaba da tafiya a kan tafarkin da suka rika da kuma irin ci gaban da suka samu da kuma tsayin dakansu sun bada musu kasa a ido da kuma tabbatar wa dukkan duniya ciki kuwa har da makiya din cewa 'lalle za mu iya'.	i want everyone to understand that despite what they hope to see, the people of iran continue to progress in their thinking and the kind of progress they have achieved, and their resilience has given them a lower hand in sight and to assure the whole world including their enemies that 'indeed we can'.
581	The reason why we stress our strengths is to prove that the Iranian nation made use of its capabilities. The Iranian nation proved that it is capable in spite of the will of the ill-wishers who wanted to prove that the Iranian nation was incapable.	Dalilin da ya sanya muke ta magana kan bangarorin karfi da nasarorin da aka samu shi ne don mu tabbatar wa (duniya) cewa al'ummar Iran ta yi amfani da irin wannan karfi da take da shi ne sannan kuma sabanin abin da masu bakar aniya suke son nunawa cewa al'ummar Iran ba za su iya ba, sun tabbatar da cewa lalle za su iya.	the reason we are discussing the power capabilities and achievements that have been made is to assure (the world) that the iranian nation has used this kind of power and has it, and also to contradict what the pessimists want to show that the iranian nation cannot, they have confirmed that they certainly can.
582	We are aware of our weak points. We have our own weak points, but in general, our strengths are far more than our weak points.	Ba wai ba mu da bangarori na rauni ba ne, lalle muna da bangarori na rauni; to amma a yanayi na gaba daya bangaren karfin da muke da shi da kuma irin nasarorin da muka samu sun fi bangarorin raunin yawa.	it's not that we don't have problems, of course we have problems; but in the future, the strength we have and the successes we've achieved outweigh many of our problems.
583	"The year 1390 was named ""The Year of Economic Jihad""."	"Mun ba wa shekarar 1390 (da ta gabata) sunan 'Shekarar Kokarin Bunkasa Tattalin Arziki""; a saboda haka a wannan shekarar (zan fara maganata ne) daga batun tattalin arziki."	we have given the year 1390 (which has passed) the name 'year of economic development efforts'; therefore, in this year (i will start my story) from the issue of economic development.
584	What is noteworthy is the economic movement of our government officials which was accompanied by the exemplary and praiseworthy cooperation of the people throughout the year 1390.	Lalle irin ayyukann da jami'an kasar nan suka gudanar a fagen tattalin arziki tare da kuma irin hadin kan da mutane suka ba su tsawon shekarar da ta gabatan wani lamari ne abin ambato da jinjinawa.	the kind of activities that the citizens of this country have carried out in the economic sector, as well as the kind of cooperation they have given to people over the past year, is a matter of commendation and pride.
585	Among the things that can be mentioned in this regard is the issue of redistributing state subsidies.	Daga cikin abubuwan da za a iya ambato a wannan bangaren shi ne wannan siyasa ta manufantar da irin tallafin da gwamnati take bayarwa.	among the things that can be mentioned in this regard is this policy of manufacturing the kind of support the government is providing.
586	All economic experts - both the ones who served in the previous governments and those who serving in the current government - unanimously agree that redistributing state subsidies is a necessity for the country.	Bakin dukkanin masanan tattalin arziki, shin a cikin gwamnatocin da suka gabata ne ko kuma cikin wannan gwamnatin ne sun hadu kan cewa aiwatar da wannan siyasar dai ta zama dole a kasar nan; kowa ya yarda da hakan.	regarding all economic experts, is it within the previous governments or in this current government that they agreed that implementing this policy has become necessary in this country; everyone agrees with that.
587	In spite of the fact that everybody agreed on the necessity of taking action, nobody had done anything due to the complexities and hardships involved. In the year 1390, the executive and legislative branches of government made efforts and carried out important stages of this work while we were under sanctions and while the hardships and complexities were more than ever before.	Duk kuwa da cewa wannan wani lamari ne da aka yi tarayya a kansa, to amma lamarin ya ci gaba da zama ba tare da an aiwatar da shi saboda irin matsaloli da wahalhalun da ke cikinsa. Amma gwamnati da majalisa a shekarar da ta gabatan, a irin wannan yanayi na takunkumi da ake ciki wanda matsala da wahalar da ke cikin lamari ya fi na koyaushe wahala, sun yi himma da fara aiwatar da wannan aiki, kuma ya zuwa yanzu an aiwatar da wani bangare mai muhimmanci na shirin.	despite the fact that this is a national issue, the problem continues to persist without being addressed due to the challenges and difficulties within it. however, the government and the legislature in the past year, in this period of turmoil and the problems and difficulties within the issue that are more often troublesome, have made efforts to start implementing this work, and so far a significant part of the project has been implemented.
588	The work is not finished yet, but what has been done so far by our government officials both in the executive branch and in the Majlis - which have been mostly successful due to the support and cooperation of the people - are very important and remarkable.	Aikin dai ba mai karewa ba ne, to amma abin da ya zuwa yanzu jami'an gwamnati - shin a cikin gwamnatin ne ko kuma a majalisa - suka yi sannan kuma jama'a suka goyi bayansu lalle an samu nasarori kuma an aiwatar da aiki mai muhimmanci abin jinjinawa.	the job is not a thankless one, but what has happened so far is that government officials - whether in the government or in the legislature - have become aware and then the people have supported them, certainly we have achieved successes and carried out important work worth celebrating.
589	All our honorable people are familiar with the objectives, but it is necessary to reflect on them. The work that has been done is great.	Dukkanin al'ummarmu sun ji su, to amma wajibi ne a yi tunani sosai a kansu. Wannan aikin, aiki ne mai girma; aiki ne mai muhimmanci.	all our communities have heard them, but it is necessary to think deeply about them. this work, is a great work; it is an important work.
590	One of the objectives of this law is fair distribution of the state subsidies.	Daya daga cikin manufofin wannan shirin shi ne raba irin tallafin da gwamnati take bayarwa ga al'umma cikin adalci.	one of the objectives of this program is to distribute the kind of assistance that the government provides to the public fairly.
591	I explained in a speech that state subsidies have always been distributed among the people in an unfair way: this is the nature of general subsidies.	A baya a wani jawabi na yi bayani kan hakan cewa a baya ana raba irin wannan tallafi tsakanin bangarori daban-daban na al'umma ne ta hanyar da babu adalci a cikinta; a dabi'ance dai haka aikin raba tallafi yake.	previously in a response, i explained that the distribution of this kind of relief among different sectors of the community in the past was done in a way that lacked fairness; traditionally this is how the relief work is done.
592	I have received reliable reports from across the country that targeted subsidies have played a significant role in improving living standards of the lower social classes.	Ina da ingantaccen labari daga bangarori daban-daban na kasar nan da ke nuni da cewa hakan yayi tasiri wajen kyautata rayuwar mutane marasa shi a tsakanin al'umma.	i have credible news from various sectors of this country indicating that this has had an impact on improving the lives of the less privileged in the society.
593	This is one of the goals, which is also the most important objective of the subsidy law.	Wannan daya ne daga cikin manufofin wannan shirin kuma shi ne mafi muhimmancin manufar aiwatar da wannan dokar.	this is one of the disadvantages of this program and it is the most important disadvantage in implementing this policy.
594	Another goal is to reform the structure of production and the structure of our economy.	Wata manufar kuma ta daban, ita ce gyara tsarin abubuwan da ake samarwa da kuma tsarin tattalin arziki na kasar nan.	another strategy, however, is to improve the system of things being produced and the country's economic structure.
595	Economic experts unanimously agree that targeted subsidies can resolve this problem. They agree that wasteful and low-yield production can be remedied and a balance can be created between input and output.	Bisa kididdigar masanan tattalin arziki - wanda dukkaninsu sun yi tarayya kan hakan - ana iya gyara hakan ta hanyar aiwatar da wannan shiri na manufantar da irin tallafin da ake bayarwa; hakan zai iya daidaita irin abubuwan da ake samarwa da kuma amfani da shi.	based on the research of economic experts - all of whom have agreed on this - it is possible to improve this situation by implementing this manufacturing and subsidy program; this could balance the kind of products being produced and their usage.
596	Another goal is to manage energy consumption.	Wata manufar kuma ta daban ita ce amfani da makamashin da ake da shi yadda ya dace.	another advantage is its use of the machine as appropriate.
597	Because we have been an oil-rich country, we have been in the habit of using gas, natural gas, diesel and kerosene in a wasteful way.	Da yake mu din nan kasa ce da Allah ya albarkace ta da man fetur, don haka mun saba da yin almubazzaranci wajen amfani da man fetur, gas, kananzir ba tare da lura ba.	this land of ours is blessed by god with petroleum resources, hence we are accustomed to squandering when it comes to using petroleum, gas, and kerosene without considering.
598	Our consumption has been more wasteful than many countries - and in a sense, more wasteful than all countries in the world.	Irin yadda muke amfani da wadannan albarkatu ya dara na da dama daga cikin kasashen duniya - mai yiyuwa ne ma ana iya cewa sama da dukkanin kasashen duniya.	the way we use these blessings is better than many countries in the world - it is productive and can be said to be above all the countries of the world.
599	Reliable statistics have been published which show that if the subsidy law had not been implemented, we would be consuming gas almost twice the amount we currently do.	Kididdigar da aka fitar, kuma kididdiga ce abar yarda, tana nuna mana cewa idan da a ce har ya zuwa yanzu ba a fara aiwatar da wannan shiri ba, to da kuwa irin amfani da mai da ake yi a kasar nan ya ninka irin yadda ake amfani da shi a halin yanzu har sau biyu.	the released kite, and the kite is a symbol of agreement, showing us that if it is said that it has come now, this process has not started, then the way it is used in this country has changed the way it is used now up to twice.
600	When we do not produce sufficient gasoline to meet our domestic needs, what do we have to do?	A lokacin da ya zamana ba ma samar da wadataccen man da ake bukata a cikin gida, to me ya wajaba mu aikata?	when it becomes impossible to provide the necessary food at home, what should we do?
601	We would have to import it.	Kenan wajibi ne mu shigo da mai daga waje; wato wajibi ne al'ummar Iran su zamanto masu mika kokon bara zuwa hannun makiya da masu bakar aniya.	indeed, it is our duty to enter with oil from outside; that is, it is the duty of the iranian people to become those who hand over the baton to the hands of the oppressed and the deprived.
602	Today our domestic consumption of gasoline is approximately as much as our production. We do not need to import gasoline, which is a great advantage for the country.	To amma sakamakon wannan aikin an samu nasarar yin tsumulmular mai din. A halin yanzu man da ake amfani da shi a cikin gida kusan ya yi daidai da abin da ake samarwa; saboda haka babu bukatar mu shigo da mai.	however, as a result of this work, we have successfully made a thermostat. the one we are currently using in the house is almost as good as the one we produce; therefore, there is no need for us to import oil.
603	This was done in the year 1390, exactly when our enemies increased their sanctions on us in order to bring our nation to its knees.	Wannan aiki ne da aka yi shi a shekarar 1390 da ta gabata; a daidai lokacin da makiyanmu suka sanya mana takunkumi don su dunkufar da al'ummarmu.	this work was done in the year 1390 and beyond; at the same time our ancestors put pots for us to protect our community.
604	But our youth made efforts and foiled the plots of the enemy with their actions.	To amma matasan cikin al'ummarmu sun yi himma, ta hanyar irin wannan aikin na su sun sami nasarar magance makircin makiya.	however, the youths in our community have made efforts, through this kind of work they have succeeded in overcoming the problem of unemployment.
605	Another important economic measure which was taken with the help of our people was in the arena of science and technology.	Wani aiki mai muhimmancin gaske da aka aiwatar da shi a shekaar da ta gabatan, sakamakon himmar jama'a, shi ne abin da aka yi a fagen ilimi da fasaha.	a significant task that was carried out in the past year, as a result of people's efforts, is what was done in the field of education and eloquence.
606	Science and technology is one of the pillars of a nation's economic power.	Ilimi da fasaha daya ne daga cikin tushen tabbatar da tattalin arziki da sanya shi tsayawa da kafafunsa.	education and eloquence is one of the pillars of confirming wealth and making it stand on its feet.
607	A nation that enjoys advanced knowledge and technology will achieve wealth, political independence, honor and power.	A lokacin da wata al'umma ta sami ilimi da ya ci gaba da fasaha ta zamani, to kuwa za ta sami dukiya haka nan kuma za ta sami karfi na siyasa, za ta zamanto mai mutumci da kuma samun karfi.	when a community acquires knowledge and continues to advance in eloquence, it will indeed acquire wealth and also gain political power, it will become civilized and powerful.
608	I am sensitive to the issue of scientific and technological progress because of the key role it plays.	Saboda irin muhimmancin da lamarin ci gaba na ilimi da fasaha yake da shi ne ya sanya nake ba wa wannan lamari muhimmanci na musamman.	because of the importance of the issue of education and eloquence, i am giving this issue special importance.
609	I receive different reports from different channels on a regular basis and I can say with certainty that the level of our country's advances is much higher than what has been reported.	Ina samun rahotanni daban-daban a kusan kullum daga bangarori daban-daban (kan irin ayyukan da ake gudanarwa) don haka ina iya sanar da ku cewa irin ci gaban da aka samu a kasar nan nesa ba kusa ba ya fi abubuwan da ya zuwa yanzu aka sanar.	i receive various reports almost daily from different sectors (on the kind of activities being carried out) so i can inform you that the progress made in this country is not close to the things that have been reported so far.
610	According to the reports prepared by reliable scientific centers of world - and not our own scientific centers - the fastest scientific growth is taking place in Iran.	A bisa ga rahoton da cibiyoyin ilimi na duniya da aka yarda da su suka fitar - wanda ba wai cibiyoyin iliminmu ne suka fadi ba - a halin yanzu mafi saurin ci gaba na ilimi da ake samu a duniya shi ne wanda yake faruwa a Iran.	according to the report that the world's scientific institutions have released - which are not our own scientific institutions - the fastest progress in education currently happening in the world is in iran.
611	Reliable scientific centers of the world reported that in the year 2011 - which ended three months before the year 1390 - the scientific growth of the Iranian nation was 20 percent more than the year 2010. What is the meaning of this?	A shekarar 1390 wadda ta yi kusan daidai da shekara ta 2011 miladiyya, rahoton da cibiyoyin ilimi na duniya suka fitar a shekara ta 2011 - wanda watanni uku kenan da karewarta - al'ummar Iran ta sami gagarumin ci gaba na ilimi sama da irin wadda ta samu a shekara ta 2010 miladiyya sannan kuma irin ci gaban da ta samu ya kai kashi ashirin cikin dari. Mece ce ma'anar hakan?	in the year 1390, which is approximately equivalent to the year 2011 ad, a report released by the world's scientific institutions in 2011 - which is three months away from its end - the iranian population has made significant scientific progress similar to what it achieved in 2010 ad, and the progress it has made has reached twenty percent in a hundred. what is the meaning of this?
612	The Iranian nation acted like that in a situation in which the enemies of the Iranian nation were betting on our collapse and were describing their sanctions as crippling.	An samu hakan ne a daidai lokacin da makiyan al'ummar Iran suka sha alwashin kawar da al'ummar Iran suna cewa mun sanya wa al'ummar Iran takunkumi mai ruguzarwa, to amma sai ga shi al'ummar Iran ta samu nasarar aiwatar da irin wannan aikin.	we got this at the right time when the iranian people protested against the iranian government saying we have put the iranian people in a revolving crisis, but then the iranian people succeeded in implementing such a task.
613	Reliable scientific centers of the world also report that Iran is the top country in the region in terms of its scientific level and that it ranks 17th in the world.	Har ila yau a cikin rahotannin na su - shi din ma rahoton cibiyoyin ilimi da aka yarda da su a duniya - da ke cewa a wannan yanki Iran ita ce ta farko a fagen ci gaban ilimi, sannan kuma ta goma sha bakwai a dukkan duniya.	until today in their reports - including the report on scientific achievements that have been agreed upon in the world - they say that in this region iran is the first in the field of scientific advancement, and then it is seventeenth in the whole world.
614	These reports are prepared by those who would not refuse to present false reports against us if they could, yet they acknowledge our growth like this. In the year 1390 we made progress in biotechnology. We made progress in nanotechnology.	Wannan rahoto ne da wasu mutane wadanda idan da a ce suna da damar fitar da wani rahoto sabanin hakan da sun yi; to amma sai ga shi suna fadin hakan. A shekarar 1390 mun sami ci gaba a fagen fasahar halittu, haka nan a fasahar Nano, a fagen fasahar ilimin sararin samaniya mun sami ci gaba - wanda a shekarar ce aka harba tauraron dan'adam na Nawid - mun sami ci gaba a fagen fasahar nukiliya, mun sami nasarar tace sinadarin uranium kashi ashirin cikin dari a shekarar 1390.	this report is from some people who, when they say they have the ability to release a different report than what they have done; well, but then they say this. in 1390, we made progress in the field of mineral science, so in the field of nano, in the field of space science education we made progress - which in the year was the launch of the human satellite of nawid - we made progress in the field of nuclear science, we succeeded in saying the uranium enrichment twenty percent in the year 1390.
615	In the year 1389 the Americans and others proposed certain preconditions for this 20-percent uranium.	Wannan tace uranium kashi ashirin cikin dari din, shi ne abin da a shekarar 1389 Amurka da sauransu suka ta kafa mana sharudda kafin su ba mu shi.	this means that uranium is twenty percent of the weight, it is what america and others established for us in the year 1389 before they gave it to us.
616	We had to prepare it for our research reactor in Tehran, which has been built to produce radiopharmaceuticals: we had run out of 20-percent enriched uranium.	Ya zama wajibi mu samar da makamashi (wato tacaccen uranium kashi ashirin cikin dari) ga cibiyar bincikenmu ta Tehran, saboda kuwa makashin da ake da shi din ya kusan karewa.	it has become our responsibility to provide isotopes (specifically uranium-20) to our research center in tehran, because the supply we have is almost exhausted.
617	They proposed certain preconditions for providing this uranium. They said that we had to ship our uranium abroad to be enriched to 20-percent.	Sun kafa mana wasu sharudda don ba mu uranium din suna cewa wajibi ne mu aike da uranium din da muka tace zuwa kasashen waje; to amma mun ki amincewa da hakan.	they have imposed some conditions on us not to give us uranium, saying it is obligatory for us to send the uranium we said to foreign countries; well, but we agreed to that.
618	The Americans used the Brazilian and Turkish governments as intermediaries in order to reach an agreement with us.	Jami'an Brazil da na Turkiya sun zo nan suka zauna da shugaban kasarmu da yin bahasi sannan kuma suka sanya hannu kan wata yarjejeniya.	the delegates from brazil and turkey have come here, they met with our country's leader and had a discussion, then they also participated in a certain ceremony.
619	After the agreement was signed, the Americans broke their promise: the agreement was not the kind of agreement they wanted. They wanted to win many concessions. They wanted to bully and blackmail us.	To amma bayan da aka sanya hannu kan wannan yarjejeniyar sai Amurkawa suka yi watsi da shi. Ba sa so a sanya hannu kan wannan yarjejeniyar, suna so ne su sami karin wasu abubuwa, su yi amfani da karfi da tursasawa don a mika musu kai.	however, after this resolution was adopted, the americans rejected it. they did not want to adopt this resolution, they wanted to get more things, to use force and intimidation to impose it on them.
620	Because the Americans broke their promise, the Brazilian and Turkish governments were embarrassed in front of us. This is the story of the 20-percent uranium.	Sakamakon rashin cika alkawarin da Amurkawa suka yi, hakan ya sanya gwamnatocin Brazil da Turkiya cikin kunya. Wannan shi ne lamarin tace sinadarin uranium kashi ashirin cikin dari.	as a result of the failure to fulfill the promise made by the americans, this has put the governments of brazil and turkey in a difficult situation. this is the issue of enriching uranium to twenty percent.
621	In the year 1390, they produced 20-percent enriched uranium for the research reactor in Tehran and they announced their achievement to the world. Our enemies were astonished.	A shekarar da ta gabatan sun samar da uranium da aka tace kashi ashirin cikin dari din don amfanin cibiyar nukiliyan Tehran sannan kuma suka sanar da hakan ga duniya; haka makiyanmu suka shiga cikin damuwa suka rasa abin yi.	the year that just ended provided uranium, which they said was twenty percent of the total for the benefit of tehran's nuclear plant, and they also announced this to the world; thus our enemies became worried and lost what to do.
622	Although they knew the nuclear reactor in Tehran only produces radiopharmaceuticals, they refused to provide the 20-percent uranium we needed. The reactor in Tehran fulfills the needs of our hospitals and laboratories across the country and thousands of patients need these radiopharmaceuticals, yet they proposed preconditions to blackmail us.	Duk kuwa da cewa sun san cewa cibiyar ta Tehran saboda samar da magani ne - wato saboda biyan bukatar marasa lafiya da gudanar da bincike wanda kuma dubban marasa lafiya suna bukatar wannan cibiyar - to amma kuma duk da hakan suka hana (wannan makamashin), suka ki sayarwa, suna masu kafa sharadi da neman a mika muku kai.	even though they know that the tehran center is for providing medicine - that is, for meeting the needs of the unhealthy and conducting research, which many unhealthy people need this center - but still, they stopped (this machine), they sold it, they are causing problems and asking to send it to you.
623	Our youth produced the uranium we needed.	Nan take matasanmu suka samar da shi.	here is where our youths created it.
624	The work was complicated and difficult, but our youth managed to do it. Currently various kinds of radiopharmaceuticals are being produced at the research center in Tehran with domestically produced uranium.	Aiki ne mai wahala da rikitarwa, aiki ne mai wahala, amma haka aka aiwatar da shi sannan kuma a halin yanzu ana ci gaba da samar da magunguna daban-daban a wannan cibiya ta Tehran da wannan makamashi da aka samar da shi a cikin gida.	work is challenging and demanding, work is difficult, but it was carried out and now they continue to produce different drugs in this field in tehran and this factory that was established at home.
625	This was done in the year 1390.	Wannan lamari ne da ya faru a shekara ta 1390 (da ta gabata).	this event occurred in the year 1390 (and beyond).
626	In the year 1390 fuel plates were produced domestically in the nuclear industry.	A takaice dai a lokacin da aka taso da maganar musayen uranium din da aka tace a cikin gida, suna cewa ne ku ba wa kasar Rasha uranium din da kuka tace kashi uku da rabi cikin dari, kasar Rasha ta tace shi zuwa kashi ashirin cikin dari; daga nan ta mika shi ga kasar Faransa, ita kuwa kasar Faransa ta mai she shi zuwa makamashi sai ta ba mu shi. Ina, sai masana da matasanmu suka ce mu da kanmu za mu iya samar da wannan makashin; inda suka yi himma da kokari sannan kuma suka samar da shi da kuma nuna shi ga duniya.	in summary, at the time when the issue of uranium enrichment was raised in the house, they were saying that you gave russia uranium that you claimed was three and a half percent enriched, russia said it was twenty percent; from there it was sent to france, and france claimed to have enriched it to the maximum before giving it back to us. then, our scientists and young people said that we can produce this fuel ourselves; where they worked hard and finally produced it and presented it to the world.
627	This was done in the year 1390.	Wannan lamari ne da ya faru a shekara ta 1390.	this event happened in the year 1390.
628	The sixfold increase in recombinant drugs and the increase in the export of knowledge-based products and services - these achievements were made in the year 1390.	Karuwar adadin magungunan da ake hadawa ninkin baninkiya har sau shida, da kuma irin karuwar kayayyakin da ake fitarwa waje da kuma irin ayyukan hidima ga al'umma da aka yi, dukkanin hakan an samar da su ne a sheakar 1390.	the increase in the number of drugs being smuggled into the bank six times, and the increase in the goods being smuggled out, as well as the services provided to the public, all of this was achieved in the year 1390.
629	"These are part of achievements which were made in ""The Year of Economic Jihad""."	"Wadannan wani bangare ne na irin nasarorin da aka samu a shekarar 'Kokarin bunkasa tattalin arziki"" (shekarar da ta gabata)."	"these are some of the successes achieved in the ""effort to boost the economy"" year (the previous year)."
630	These are technological advances.	Wadannan ci gaba ne na ilimi, ci gaba ne na fasaha, abubuwa ne da suke nuni da karfi na ilimi, to amma dukkaninsu suna da tasiri na kai tsaye cikin tattalin arzikin kasar nan.	these are advancements in education, advancements in eloquence, things that indicate the strength of education, but all of them have a standing impact on the economy of this country.
631	Last week at the end of the year 1390, I visited the Research Institute of Petroleum Industry.	A karshen wannan shekara ta 1390 - wato a wannan makon da ya wuce - na kai rangadi cibiyar bincike na masana'antar mai.	at the end of this year 1390 - that is, this past week - i visited the research center of the oil industry.
632	There were certain things in the institute which can be witnessed when touring different other research centers of the country as well: they convince one that these advances are the rule, not the exception. These important advances - which our people would not even dream about - have been made already and they have become the rule.	A nan na ga abubuwa da yawa da kuma irin ci gaban da aka samu a fagage daban-daban na ilimi, wanda ana iya ganin makamancin hakan ma a wasu bangarorin. Don haka ne mutum yana iya cewa ba wai kawai a wannan wajen ne aka samu irin wannan ci gaban ba. Wadansu abubuwa ne wadanda a baya al'ummarmu ko a mafarki ma ba su taba ganin irin wadannan ci gaban ba, to amma an cimma su.	here, i have seen many things and the kind of progress that has been made in various fields of knowledge, which can be seen as unprecedented in some areas. therefore, one can say that it is not only in this place that such progress has been made. some of these things are things that our community in the past or even in the distant past have never seen such progress, but they have achieved it.
633	First of all, jihad-like spirit and thought were predominant in the institute.	A matakin farko shi ne ruhi da tunani na jihadi da ke cikin zukatan masu gudanar da wannan aikin.	the first step is the spirit and thought of the struggle that is in the hearts of those who carry out this work.
634	The scientists were working with a jihad-like spirit. They were working as if they were involved in jihad, as if they were fighting in the battlefield in the way of God.	Wadannan masana suna gudnar da ayyukansu ne da ruhi na jihadi; wato tamkar mutanen da suke yin jihadi, tamkar suna a fagen jihadi saboda Allah ne.	these scholars are conducting their activities with the spirit of jihad; like people who are engaging in jihad, as if they are on the battlefield of jihad for the sake of allah.
635	There is a big difference between those who work for the sake of money, social position, fame or knowledge and those who work for the sake of jihad in the way of God.	Akwai bambanci tsakanin mutanen da suke aiki saboda kudi, saboda matsayi, saboda shahara ko kuma saboda shi kansa ilimi din da kuma wadanda suke aiki a matsayin jihadi saboda Allah.	there is a difference between people who work for money, for status, for fame or for their own knowledge, and those who work as jihadists for the sake of allah.
636	This is very valuable.	Lalle hakan lamari ne mai kima da muhimmancin gaske.	henna is a very important and valuable substance.
637	The second characteristic is that our scientists consider the sanctions that are imposed on our nation as opportunities.	Siffa ta biyu ita ce na ga cewa masananmu sun mayar da wannan takunkumi da aka sanya wa al'ummarmu zuwa wata dama.	the second characteristic i see is that our scholars have transformed this burden that was placed on our community into an advantage.
638	"During the visit to the institute, which lasted a long time, a few people told me, ""Thank God they imposed sanctions on us."	A yayin wannan rangadi na sa'oi da na kai, wasu mutane sun bayyana min cewa lalle muna gode wa Allah da suka sanya mana takunkumin.	during this competition that i organized and led, some people have expressed to me that indeed we are grateful to god who has given us this opportunity.
639	The feeling that the sanctions imposed by the enemies provide us with an opportunity is very valuable.	Wannan ruhi na jin cewa takunkumin da makiya suka sanya mana a matsayin wata dama, lamari ne mai kima da kuma muhimmanci.	this spirit tells me that the obstacles and challenges they have put us through are an opportunity, a matter of great importance and significance.
640	The third characteristic that I noticed among the employees of the institute was their great self-confidence.	Siffa ta uku wacce na ganta a wancan wajen, ita ce irin gagarumar yarda da kai da ake da ita.	the third characteristic i noticed in that place, is the kind of large acceptance and respect they have.
641	Certain parts of the oil industry have been monopolized by three, four countries in the world: they do not allow other countries to access their technologies.	Wasu bangarori na masana'antun mai din wasu 'yan kasashe uku zuwa hudu ne kawai suke da su; ba sa taba bari wani ya sami irin wannan fasahar.	some industries only allow experts from three or four countries; they never let anyone else acquire this kind of skill.
642	Over these years, our country has always asked them to do such important and complex things for us and we have paid for their services.	Tsawon shekaru kasar mu take bukatar a koya mata wannan fagen da wadannan ayyuka masu wahala da rikitarwa sun kashe kudade masu yawa.	for years, our country has needed to teach women this aspect, as these difficult and challenging tasks have cost a lot of money.
643	"I realized that they were determined and they were saying, ""We can. We will do this on our own."	To amma da idanuwana na ga cewa (masananmu) sun yi himma suna fadin cewa lalle za mu iya.	but with my own eyes i saw them (our scholars) striving, saying for sure we can do it.
644	This self-confidence is very valuable for a nation, for the scientists of a nation, for the youth of a nation.	Irin wannan yarda da kai a tsakanin wata al'umma da wasu masana da matasa na wata al'umma lamari ne mai kimar gaske.	this kind of agreement between a community and some scholars and youths of a community is a very important issue.
645	Another characteristic is the tendency to employ young people.	Wata siffar kuma ta daban ita ce yarda da matasa.	another form and it is different, it agrees with the youth.
646	The work is being done by the youth.	Don kuwa aiki yana hannun matasa ne.	so the work is in the hands of the youth.
647	The youth are a source of innovation and creativity.	Matasa kuma tushe ne na haske da samar da sabbin abubuwa.	the youth are also a source of light and creating new things.
648	Another characteristic is the relationship between industry and university, which has always been among my wishes.	Wata siffar kuma ta daban ita ce alakar masana'antu da jami'oi; wanda hakan ya kasance fatan da na jima ina da shi.	another aspect is the relationship between scientists and universities; which i hope i have it as long as i live.
649	I used to advise the officials in charge of the relevant sectors in the previous governments that they should try to establish a relationship between industry and university.	A ko da yaushe na kasance ina shawartar jami'an bangarori daban-daban da suke da alaka da gwamnatocin da suka gabata cewa su yi kokari wajen kulla alaka tsakanin masana'antu da jami'a.	i have always been advising various universities that have relationships with previous governments to strive to maintain relationships between scholars and the university.
650	Fortunately I saw at the institute that the relationship has been established.	Abin farin cikin shi ne cewa a wancan wajen na ga cewa an tabbatar da irin wannan alakar.	the joy in him is that in that place i saw confirmation of this kind of relationship.
651	Of course, the relationship should be prevalent and all our industries should be linked to our universities. Then both our knowledge and our industries will grow.	Ko da yake tabbas ne hakan ya hada da ko ina, a hada dukkanin masana'antunmu da jami'oi, hakan zai sanya mu samun ci gaban ilimi haka nan kuma bangaren masana'antunmu.	regardless of where it is, combining all our industries and universities, this will enable us to advance in knowledge and also in our industries.
652	This was the situation of the economic sector in the year 1390, a year in which the enemies and ill-wishers of the Iranian nation were constantly trying to intimidate us. Sometimes they made threats. Other times they mounted political pressure on us.	Wannan bangaren tattalin arziki kenan a shekarar 1390; shekarar da tun daga farkonta zuwa karshenta makiya suka ta tada jijiyoyin wuya; a wasu lokutan suna barazana, a wasu lokutan suna yin matsin lamba na siyasa, a wasu lokutan kuma suna sanya mana takunkumi.	this period of economic prosperity was in the year 1390; a year in which from its beginning to its end, they were constantly dealing with serious problems; sometimes they were in turmoil, sometimes they were involved in political intrigue, and sometimes they were setting traps for us.
653	The agents of the US government are making efforts throughout the world to implement the sanctions, hoping that they will harm the Iranian nation and create a rift between the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic.	A halin yanzu 'yan amshin shatan gwamnatin Amurka a duk fadin duniya suna nan suna ta kokari wajen ganin sun aiwatar da wannan takunkumin, a tunaninsu don su cutar da al'ummar Iran da kuma haifar da rikici tsakanin al'ummar Iran da tsarin Musulunci.	as of now, american government spies all over the world are here, trying to ensure the execution of this conspiracy, with the belief that they will plague the iranian people and also cause conflict between the iranian people and the islamic system.
654	In the year 1390 we made other great achievements as well, including the active diplomacy that we employed in case of the regional issues.	Akwai wasu manyan nasarorin da aka samu na daban a shekara ta 1390; ciki kuwa har da irin ayyukan diplomasiyya da aka gudanar da suka shafi batutuwan da suke faruwa a wannan yankin a shekarar 1390.	there were some significant achievements made in the year 1390; including diplomatic activities that were conducted relating to the events occurring in this region in the year 1390.
655	The Conference on Islamic Awakening, the Conference on Palestinian Intifada, the Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, the World Without Terrorism Conference and the Islamic Awakening and Youth Conference were among the activities which were carried out in Tehran.	Gudanar da tarurrukan farkawa ta Musulunci, taron Palastinu, taron kwance damarar makamai, taron kasa da kasa na duniya ba tare da ayyukan ta'addanci ba, taron matasa da farkawa ta Musulunci, dukkanin wadannan suna daga cikin ayyukan da aka gudanar a Tehran.	conducting islamic awakening conferences, the palestine conference, the conference to support the rights of nations, the world-wide conference without violent activities, the conference of islamic awakening youth, all these are among the activities conducted in tehran.
656	The Islamic Republic became the center of attention in the world of Islam which has awakened today.	Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran ta zamanto wata cibiyar da idanuwar duniyar musulmi suka koma gare su, wanda a yau sun farka.	the islamic republic of iran has become a center that the eyes of the muslim world have turned to, which they have awakened to today.
657	In the area of economic services, tens of thousands of houses were built in the country and were made available to the people.	A fagen hidima ta tattalin arziki, an gina dubban gidaje da mika su ga jama'a.	in the field of economic development, various buildings have been constructed and presented to the community.
658	These statistics are great. They are important statistics. Houses were built in rural areas.	Wannan dai wani adadi ne mai girman gaske da muhimmanci. An gina gidaje a kauyuka, an gina tituna da manyan hanyoyi.	this is indeed a significant and important number. houses have been built in villages, bridges and major roads have been constructed.
659	"These are the preliminary stages of ""The Decade of Progress and Justice""."	Wadannan abubuwa ne da aka samar da su a wadannan shekaru na ci gaba da tabbatar da adalci.	these are the things that have been created in these years to ensure justice continues.
660	One great example of the praiseworthy movements which were carried out by the Iranian nation in the year 1390 was the parliamentary election that was held on the 12th of Esfand.	Duk da irin wadannan makirce-makirce na makiya da masu mummunar aniya, amma wannan al'umma ta kasance a tsaye da kuma samar da irin wannan ci gaban da aka samu.	despite all these petty squabbles and malicious intentions, this community has remained steadfast and has managed to make the kind of progress that has been achieved.
661	Of course, I would stress that the election is not over yet. Our people should show the same magnificence in the second round as well.	Ko da yake ya kamata a fahimci cewa har ya zuwa yanzu ba a kammala zaben ba; ina fatan al'umma za su fito kwansu da kwarkwatansu a lokacin da za a gudanar da zagaye na biyu na zaben.	regardless, it should be understood that the election is not yet over; i hope that the public will come out in their numbers and masses at the time of the second round of the election.
662	The election was extremely important.	Wannan zaben dai yana da muhimmancin gaske.	this election is truly important.
663	As I have pointed out before, the enemies did everything in their power for around six months in order to discourage the people from taking part in the election.	Ina son in sanar da ku, a baya ma na taba fadi, kimanin watanni shida kenan (makiya) suke ta iyakacin kokarinsu wajen ganin sun kashe gwuiwan al'umma don kada su fito.	i want to inform you, as i have said before, for about six months (women) they have been making efforts to ensure they kill the public's interest so they don't come out.
664	Sometimes they said the election would be rigged. Other times they said if the people did not take part in the election, the enemies would become less hostile, and they broadcast various kinds of propaganda in order to drive the people away from the polling stations and ballot boxes.	A wani lokaci suna cewa za a yi mgudi; a wani lokacin kuma suna cewa matukar dai mutane suka ki fitowa to irin adawar da makiya suke yi da al'ummar Iran za ta ragu; sun gudanar da nau'oi daban-daban na farfaganda wajen hana mutane fitowa zaben.	sometimes they say there will be a strike; at other times they say that if people are too afraid to come out, the kind of protest that women in iran are doing will collapse; they carry out various types of propaganda to prevent people from voting.
665	Yet other times they tried to intimidate, discourage and disappoint our people by assassinating our scientists. They carried out three assassinations in less than six months.	A wani lokacin ta hanyar kashe masananmu - wanda cikin kasa da watanni shida, sun aiwatar da irin wannan aikin ta'addancin guda uku - manufarsu ita ce su razama mutanenmu, su kashe musu gwuiwa.	at some point through killing our scholars - who in six months, have carried out such dangerous work three times - their intention is to terrorize our people, to kill their spirit.
666	Over the past ten years, the rate of voter turnout in the congressional elections - the Senate and the House of Representatives - has never reached forty percent.	Tsawon shekaru goman da suka gabata irin adadin fitowar mutane a lokacin zabubbubakn majalisar dokoki da ta dattawa da ta wakilai (a Amurka) ba ta kai kashi 40 cikin dari ba.	the number of people who appeared during the impeachment hearings and trials (in america) over the past fifty years did not reach 40 percent.
667	If you compare this with the turnout rate of the Iranian people and their dynamism and presence, then the significance of the matter will be revealed.	To ku kwatanta hakan da al'ummar Iran - ku dubi irin wannan nishadi da fitowar da mutane suke yi - to a irin wannan lokacin ne muhimmancin lamarin zai fito fili.	if you compare this with the people of iran - look at the kind of joy and emergence people are having - then at times like this, the importance of the matter will come to light.
668	Through those pressures, through that psychological warfare, through those threats, through those assassinations, they wanted to make the 12th of Esfand a day of disappointment for the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic, but despite their will and much to their disappointment, the 12th of Esfand became a day of honor and glory for the Islamic Republic and the people of Iran.	Ta hanyar irin wannan matsin lambar, ta hanyar irin wannan wasa da hankali da irin wadannan barazana da wannan kisan gillan suna so ne wannan rana ta 12 ga watan Esfand (ranar da aka gudanar da zaben 'yan majalisa a Iran) ta zamanto ranar raba gari tsakanin al'umma da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci. To amma sabanin abin da suke fatan gani, wannan ranar ta zamanto ranar daukaka ga tsarin Musulunci da kuma al'ummar Iran.	through this kind of protest, through this kind of game with caution and these kinds of threats and this killing, they want this day of the 12th of esfand (the day the parliamentary elections were held in iran) to become a day of division between the people and the islamic republic system. but contrary to what they hope to see, this day has become a day of glory for the islamic system and the people of iran.
669	The parliamentary election acted as an honest and powerful media outlet.	Lalle wannan zaben ya zamanto wata kafar watsa labarai mai gaskiya da kuma karfi.	indeed, this election has become a powerful and truthful news broadcasting platform.
670	They report events that have not happened in Iran and they do not report the events that have happened, but they cannot deny the election.	Sun kasance suna gurbata labaran abubuwan da ke gudana a Iran, suna fadin labaran karya kan Iran, sannan kuma suna boye labarai na hakika, to amma babu yadda za a iya inkarin wannan zaben.	they have been distorting news about events happening in iran, spreading false news about iran, and also hiding the real news, but there is no way to deny this election.
671	It happened in front of everybody's eyes.	Lamari ne wanda ya faru a kan idanuwan mutane.	it is an incident that happened in the eyes of people.
672	The election presented an accurate picture of the Iranian nation to the world like a great and powerful media outlet.	Wannan zaben ya zama tamkar wata kafar watsa labarai mai karfi da ta samu damar bayyanar da hakikanin al'ummar Iran da kuma tsarin Musulunci ga sauran al'ummomin duniya.	this election has become like a powerful news station that has the ability to expose the truth of the iranian population and the islamic system to the rest of the world.
673	These were the events that took place in the year 1390, a year in which the enemies made so many investments in order to harm the people of Iran and the Islamic Republic.	To wadannan dai su ne abubuwan da suka faru a shekara ta 1390 din; shekarar da makiya suka sanya dukkanin karfinsu don su cutar da al'ummar Iran a cikinta.	so these are the events that happened in the year 1390; the year when the plague put all their strength to infect the population of iran.
674	These things are only part of the achievements made in the year 1390.	Wadannan wasu ne daga cikin irin nasarorin da al'ummar Iran ta samu a shekarar 1390 din.	these are some of the achievements that the people of iran attained in the year 1390.
675	Since the time the nuclear issue was brought up, the pretext for their enmities has been the nuclear issue.	Tun daga lokacin da aka gabatar da batun nukiliya, shi kenan sai makiya suka fake da shi.	since the time the nuclear issue was presented, it seems only the women have been concerned about it.
676	Of course, they know and they acknowledge that Iran is not after nuclear weapons, which is true.	Tabbas sun sani sannan kuma suna ma fadin cewa Iran dai ba tana son kera makaman nukiliya ba ne.	indeed they know and they also say that iran does not want to develop nuclear weapons.
677	We have not manufactured any nuclear weapons and we never will. They know this and the nuclear issue is just a pretext. One day their pretext is the nuclear issue, another day their pretext is human rights and yet another day their pretext is other domestic issues of our country, but they are all pretexts.	Wannan shi ne hakikanin lamarin. Mu dai saboda dalilan da muke da su, ba zamu taba neman kera makaman nukiliya ba; ba mu kera ba sannan kuma ba za mu kera ba, su da kansu sun san hakan, sai dai kuma suna daukan hakan a matsayin wani abin da za su fake da shi ne. A wani lokacin suna amfani da hakan, a wani lokacin kuma suna fakewa da batun hakkokin bil'adama, a wani lokacin kuma wani lamarin na cikin gida; to amma dukkanin wadannan wasu abubuwa ne da suke fakewa da su.	this is the reality of the matter. we, for the reasons we have, will never seek to create nuclear weapons; we will not create them and we will never create them, they know this, but they still take this as something they can use against us. sometimes they use this, sometimes they use it to violate human rights, sometimes it's an internal issue; but all these are things they fabricate.
678	What is the real problem?	Mene ne asalin lamarin?	what is the origin of the matter?
679	The real problem is that the Islamic Republic is safeguarding the great oil and gas resources of the country in a powerful way.	Batu na asali shi ne irin tsayin dakan da tsarin Musulunci ya yi wajen kare arzikin mai da (iskar) gas da Allah ya yi wa wannan kasar.	the original sin is the kind of disobedience that the islamic system did to protect the wealth of the owner (the land) that god gave to this country.
680	As has always been the case, economic and political power - and the resultant scientific and military power - depend on energy sources, on oil.	Yau da gobe - tamkar jiya- tsayin daka da karfi na tattalin arziki da siyasa bugu da kari kan karfi na ilimi da soji, sun damfara ne da makamashi da man fetur.	today and tomorrow - like yesterday - the strength of the economy and politics, on top of the strength of education and the military, have caused conflicts and disputes over power and influence.
681	The world will need oil and gas for decades and this is an undeniable truth.	Har zuwa shekaru aru-aru masu zuwa duniya za ta kasance tana bukatar mai da iskar gas; wannan wani lamari ne da kowa ya amince da shi.	up to forty years from now, the world will need a gas supplier; this is a fact that everyone agrees on.
682	The arrogant powers know that their survival depends on oil and gas.	Ma'abota girman kan duniya sun san cewa rayuwarsu ta damfara ne da man fetur da iskar gas.	the world's major powers know that their lives are threatened by oil and gas pollution.
683	The day they fail to acquire oil at a cheap price, the day they are forced to make concessions and stop bullying for the sake of oil and gas - that day will be a tragic day for them. On the other hand, western countries have faced problems in terms of oil resources and their problems will increase on a daily basis.	A lokacin da ya zamana sun rasa samun wannan mai din cikin farashi mai rahusa, to a irin wannan lokacin ne zai zamanto musu dole su mika kai kan wani abu, su yi watsi da tursasawar da suke yi don su sami biyan bukatarsu. Irin wannan rana za ta zamanto bala'i a gare su. A bangare guda kasashen yammaci suna fuskantar matsala a fagen albarkatun mai sannan kuma a kowace rana wannan matsala ta su sai karuwa take yi.	at a time when they had lost access to this soothing pillow, it would be at such times that they would have to rely on something else, to ignore the discomfort they were experiencing in order to meet their needs. such a day would spell disaster for them. in some parts of the winter countries, they are facing problems in the realm of blessings and every day this problem seems to be increasing.
684	Some of the European countries - and western countries in general - will run out of oil in four years. Some others will run out of oil in six years. Yet other western countries will run out of oil in nine years.	Ajiyar man fetur din da wasu kasashen turai da na yammaci a yanayi na gaba daya ya zuwa shekaru hudu zai kare, wasu shekaru shida, wasu shekaru tara zai kare, a saboda haka wajibi ne su yi amfani da albarkatun da wasu kasashe suke da shi.	the exhaustion of my breakfast with some european countries that i enjoyed in the future will end in four years, some six years, some thirteen years will end, therefore it is their duty to make use of the blessings that some countries have.
685	According to the calculations of our experts, which are based on the statistics presented by the Americans themselves, the US currently has oil reserves of thirty-something billion barrels and it will run out of oil by 2021.	Kasar Amurka wacce ya zuwa yanzu ta ajiye kimanin ganga biliyan talatin da wani abu na mai, bisa lissafin da masananmu suka yi - wanda kuma hakan ya dogara ne da irin lissafi da adadin da Amurkawan suka fitar - ya zuwa shekara ta 2021, wato shekaru tara masu zuwa, man zai kare.	the united states, which has so far accumulated about thirty billion tons of something, according to our scientists' estimates - which also depends on the type of calculation and the number that americans have released - by 2021, that is, in the coming years, it will end.
686	Currently more than fifty percent of the world's oil flows out of the Persian Gulf and in the future the global flow of oil will depend on three oil-rich countries in the Persian Gulf region.	A wancan lokacin za su dogara ne da man fetur din da yake fitowa daga yankin Tekun Fasha wanda sama da kashi hamsin cikin dari na man duniya yana fitowa ne daga wannan yankin.	at that time, they would rely on the oil that comes from the tekun fasha region, which accounts for more than fifty percent of the world's oil production from this region.
687	Of course, Iran is one of the three oil-rich countries and I will explain this point later.	A wancan lokacin za su dogara ne da mabubbugar man fetur guda uku na wannan yanki na mu da kuma tekun fasha; wanda daya daga cikin wadannan mabubbugar ita ce kasar Iran, wanda zan yi karin bayani kan hakan.	at that time, they will depend on three major sources of oil in this region of ours, including the persian gulf; one of these major sources is iran, about which i will elaborate further.
688	Among all the countries of the world and not just the Persian Gulf region, the Islamic Republic of Iran has the greatest sources of oil and gas.	A tsakanin dukkanin kasashen duniya - ba wai kawai kasashen Tekun Fasha ba - kasar da man fetur da iskar gas din ta suka fi yawa, ita ce Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran.	among all the countries in the world - not just the opec countries - the country with the most oil and gas reserves is the islamic republic of iran.
689	Some countries have more natural gas than we do and some others have more oil than us.	Wasu kasashen gas dinsu ya fi namu yawa, wasu kuma man fetur dinsu ya fi na mu yawa.	some countries have more natural gas than us, while others have more of their petroleum than us.
690	In terms of our oil reserves, we are the fourth country in the world. There are three countries in the world which have more oil than we do. However, in terms of total amount of oil and gas reserves, the Islamic Republic, your dear homeland, has more proven oil reserves than any other country in the world.	A bangaren albarkar iskar gas mu ne kasa ta biyu a duniya - Rasha ita ce ta farko, daga ita sai mu - a fagen man fetur kuma mu ne kasa ta hudu; akwai kasashe uku wadanda suke a gabanmu wadanda albarkatun mai dinsu ya fi namu; to amma idan har aka hada albarkatun mai da iskar gas a waje guda, Jamhuriyar Musulunci, kasarmu mai girma, albarkatun da take da shi - gwargwadon abin da ya zuwa yanzu aka gano - abin da muke da shi ya fi na sauran kasashen duniya.	in terms of natural gas reserves, we are the second country in the world - russia is the first, then us - in the field of oil and we are the fourth country; there are three countries ahead of us whose reserves are greater than ours; but if you combine the reserves of oil and natural gas in one place, the islamic republic, our great country, the reserves it has - the tip of what has been discovered so far - what we have is more than other countries in the world.
691	This is very interesting for the consumers of oil in the world and for the arrogant powers whose survival depends on energy sources, on oil and gas.	Lalle wannan lamari ne mai jan hankali ga kasashen da suke amfani da mai, ga cibiyoyin ma'abota girman kai wadanda dukkanin rayuwarsu ta damfara ne da makamashi, man fetur da iskar gas.	indeed, this is a matter of great concern for countries that use oil, for major stakeholders whose entire lives are affected by fluctuations, fuel shortages and gas scarcity.
692	This is the wealth that Iran enjoys. They will run out of oil in four, ten, fifteen years, but considering the proven oil reserves, the Islamic Republic will have oil and gas for another eighty years.	Ya zuwa shekaru goma zuwa shekaru sha biyar masu zuwa man da suke da shi zai kare, to amma Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran - bisa ga albarkatun da a yau aka gano - har zuwa shekaru saba'in zuwa tamanin tana da mai; lalle wannan lamari ne mai jan hankali.	it has been ten to fifteen years since those who have it will run out, but the islamic republic of iran - according to the blessings discovered today - has up to seventy to eighty years; indeed, this matter is alarming.
693	A country that ranks first in terms of its oil and gas reserves is very interesting. What do the arrogant powers want?	Kasar da take da man fetur da iskar gas irin wannan, to me ma'abota girman kai suke so?	a country that has oil and gas resources like this, what do the supporters of pride want?
694	"They want our country to be ruled by a government whom they can easily control, just like certain countries in the region which have a lot of oil, yet they are like putty in the hands of the Americans. The Americans order them to produce certain amounts of oil and they say, ""Yes, sir."" The Americans order them to sell their oil at a particular price and they say, ""Yes, sir."""	To suna so ne wannan kasar ta zamanto karkashin wata gwamnati da kuma wani tsari da zai zamanto tamkar wani boyi-boyi a hannunsu kamar yadda wasu kasashen wannan yankin suke. Wadannan kasashen suna da man fetur, kuma da yawa ma, to amma haka suke tamkar wata kumfa a hannun Amurkawa: su ce musu ga yawan man da za ku hako, sai su ce musu babu matsala; ga yadda za ku sayar, sai su ce babu matsala; ga wadanda za ku sayarwa, babu matsala, kada ku sayar wa wane, to babu matsala.	they want this country to become under a government and a system that will turn it into a puppet in their hands as some countries in this region do. these countries have oil, and many, but they are like a glove in the hands of the americans: they tell them to increase the amount of oil, they say no problem; to reduce it, no problem; to whom to sell, no problem, not to sell to anyone, no problem.
695	In our oil-rich country, which has the largest proven oil and gas reserves in the world, they will oppose any government that safeguards this national wealth in a proud way, does not allow other countries to plunder this wealth and does not follow the policies of the enemies.	Idan har a kasar Iran, wacce mabubbuga ce ta man fetur da iskar gas, ya zamana an sami wani tsari da wata gwamnati mai kishin kasa wacce ta tsaya kyam wajen kare wannan arzikin, ta ki yarda a yi watandar wannan dukiyar sannan kuma ta ki amincewa ta mika wuya ga siyasar makiya, to kuwa za su yi kiyayya da wannan tsarin.	if in iran, a country rich in oil and gas, there is a policy and a government committed to protecting this wealth, agreeing to make this wealth sustainable and also agreeing to resist capitalist politics, then they will be faithful to this policy.
696	Those who think that if we had backed down in the case of the nuclear issue, America would no longer be hostile - they are unaware of this truth.	Mutanen da suke zaton cewa idan har mu ka ja da baya akan batun nukiliya, to Amurka za ta kawo karshen kiyayyar da take yi da mu, to lalle sun gafala daga wannan hakikar.	the people who think that if we go back on the nuclear issue, america will end the sanctions it has imposed on us, have certainly been deluded by this reality.
697	Their problem is not the nuclear issue.	Matsalarsu ba batun nukiliya ba ne.	their problem is not a nuclear issue.
698	There are certain countries in our region that have nuclear weapons, but they do not care at all.	Akwai kasashen da suke da makaman nukiliya, kuma ma suna nan a wannan yanki na mu, amma ba sa ma damuwa da su.	there are countries that have nuclear weapons, and they are here in our region, but we are not worried about them.
699	The problem is the issue of nuclear weapons or nuclear industry. The problem is not the issue of human rights.	A saboda haka lamarin ba wai batun makamin nukiliya ko kuma kera su ba ne, haka nan kuma ba batun hakkokin bil'adama ba ne.	therefore, the issue is not about nuclear power or its production, and it is also not about human rights.
700	The problem is the Islamic Republic which is standing firm against them like a lion.	Matsalar dai ita ce Jamhuriyar Musulunci wacce ta tsaya kyam a gabansu tamkar wani zaki.	the problem is that it is an islamic republic that has stood firm in their way like a lion.
701	If the Islamic Republic had agreed to betray its own people like certain regional regimes, if the Islamic Republic had surrendered to them, they would not be bothering it.	Idan da a ce Jamhuriyar Musulunci ma tamkar wasu kasashen wannan yankin ta kasance a shirye take ta ha'inci al'ummarta, ta mika musu wuya, to da babu ruwansu da ita.	if it is said that the islamic republic is like some countries in this region, it is prepared to improve its people, to give them difficulty, then they have no business with it.
702	The problem is their arrogant greed and this is the reason behind their enmity towards the Iranian nation.	Lamarin shi ne irin son wuce gona da iri na girman kai da suke da shi; wannan shi ne dalilin irin adawar da suke yi da al'ummar Iran.	the issue is the kind of desire to surpass agriculture and pride that they have; this is the reason for the kind of hostility they have with the people of iran.
703	Of course, the Americans are making a mistake.	Ko da yake tabbas Amurkawa kuskure suke yi.	even though americans are definitely making mistakes.
704	It is a big and fatal mistake to think that they can force the Islamic Republic to retreat or back down through hostility, enmity and threats, and they will be punished for this mistake.	Lalle babban kuskure ne su yi tunanin cewa ta hanyar nuna kiyayya da barazana za su iya tilasta wa Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran ja da baya, ko kuma za su sami damar kawar da Jamhuriyar Musulunci daga fage.	it is a major mistake for them to think that by showing hostility and insolence they can make the islamic republic of iran retreat, or that they will have the opportunity to overthrow the islamic republic from afar.
705	Western countries do not allow their people to learn about the future oil tragedy.	Kasashen yammaci ba sa barin al'ummominsu su fahimci irin bala'in da za su iya fadawa a fagen albarkatun mai dinsu.	winter countries do not allow their citizens to understand the kind of hardship they could face in the season of their blessings.
706	They do not want their people to realize what is awaiting them in the case of oil and energy sources. They do not want to tell this to their people.	Ba sa so al'ummominsu su fahimci abin da ya ke jiransu dangane da lamarin da ya shafi man fetur da makamashinsu; ba sa so su gaya wa al'ummominsu wadannan abubuwa.	they don't want their community to understand what's happening to them regarding the issue that involves their breakfast and their seats; they don't want to tell their community these things.
707	They think that they can move things forward by being hostile to the Iranian people, but they will not succeed.	Suna zaton cewa ta hanyar nuna kiyayya da gaba da al'ummar Iran za su iya ciyar da ayyukansu gaba. Ina ba za su iya ba.	they are assuming that through demonstrating loyalty and progress to the iranian people, they can move their projects forward. i'm not sure they can.
708	Dear brothers and sisters, dear people of Iran, you should know that today the situation of America is precarious in spite of all its muscle-flexing, in spite of all the uproar it causes.	Ina son in sanar da ku, Ya ku 'yan'uwa maza da mata masu girma, Ya ku al'ummar Iran! cewa Amurka da dukkanin irin nuna karfin da take yi, da dukkanin irin wadannan ihu bayan hari da rikice-rikicen da take haifarwa, a yau dai suna cikin yanayi na rauni da gazawa ne.	i want to inform you, o great men and women, o people of iran! that america and all kinds of power it possesses, and all kinds of these aftermaths of attacks and conflicts it causes, are now in a state of turmoil and defeat.
709	I do not want to use confidential reports or superficial things as evidence: what I am saying is simple mathematics.	Ni dai ba wai ina so ne in kafa hujja da bayanai na sirri ko kuma wasu wadansu labarai na musamman ba ne; abin da zan fadi wani abu ne da yake a fili tamkar lissafin biyu a tara da biyu hudu ne.	i am not just interested in establishing facts and confidential information or other special stories; what i will say is something that is as clear as two plus two equals four.
710	Notice that the American President came to power with the slogan of change.	Ku duba ku gani shugaban Amurka na yanzu ya dare karagar mulki ne sakamakon taken 'sauyi' da ya daga.	look and see, the current president of america has risked losing power due to the 'easy' decision he made.
711	What does change mean?	Me ake nufi da sauyi?	what is meant by ease?
712	It means that the existing situation is very bad and that we are determined to change it.	Shi ne cewa mu a halin yanzu muna cikin wani irin yanayi ne mai munin gaske, to ina so in sauya wannan yanayin ne.	he is saying that we are currently in a certain kind of situation that is truly intense, so i want to change this situation.
713	He stepped in with this slogan and the people of America voted for him because of his slogan of change, otherwise racist people were not prepared to vote for a person from an African-American background. But they did, hoping that there would be change.	To da irin wannan taken ne ya shigo fage, sannan kuma mutane suka kada masa kuri'a saboda wannan taken. Idan kuwa ba haka, al'ummar Amurka da aka sansu da nuna wariyar launin fata, ba a shirye suke su kada wa wani mutum bakin fata kuri'a ba. To amma dai sun kada masa kuri'ar saboda fatan sauyin da suke da shi.	even though this kind of issue has come to the fore, people still voted for him because of this issue. however, if not, the american people who are known for their white skin color are not prepared to deny a person with white skin a vote. but they denied him the vote because of his hope for change.
714	The fact that the slogan of change affected the people like that shows that the situation was very bad. That is to say, on the admission of the American people, the situation of America was very bad when he decided to run for president.	To irin tasirin da wannan take na sauyi ya yi cikin al'ummar (Amurka) lamari ne da ke nuni da irin munin halin da suke ciki ya yi. Wato yanayin Amurka a lokacin da wannan mutumin ya tsaya takara, kamar yadda su kansu mutanen Amurka suka tabbatar, wani yanayi ne mai muni sannan shi kuma ya yi musu alkawarin cewa zai kawo musu sauyi.	the kind of impact this change has had on the american population is an issue that highlights the kind of dire situation they are in. that is, the state of america at the time this person ran for office, as confirmed by the americans themselves, was a significant concern and he also promised them that he would bring them relief.
715	Therefore, it is an undeniable truth that the situation of America was very bad.	A saboda haka dai an amince da cewa yanayi ne mai muni.	therefore, it was agreed that the weather is significant.
716	This is not what we say: it was the American people themselves who admitted that their situation was bad.	Ni dai ba na so in fadi hakan, su kansu mutanen Amurkan su da kansu ne suka bayyana cewa yanayin da suke ciki ya yi muni.	i really didn't want to say this, but it's the americans themselves who have shown that the situation they are in is troubling.
717	Then he came to power, but did he bring about change?	To shi kenan ga shi wannan mutumin ya dare karagar mulki, shin ya haifar da sauyin?	so it is, this man dared to challenge the authority, did it cause a change?
718	Did he manage to change the situation?	Shin ya sami damar sauya wannan mummunan yanayin?	did he get a chance to change this terrible situation?
719	This debt is equal to - or bigger than - their gross domestic product.	Wannan bashin kuwa ya yi daidai ko kuma ya dara irin abubuwan da suke samarwa a cikin gida.	this sauce is perfect or it enhances the kind of things that are made in the house.
720	This is a big problem for a country.	Hakan babbar matsala ce ga wata kasa.	this is a big problem for a country.
721	As for their political situation, they were forced to leave Iraq without any achievements and in Afghanistan their situation is becoming worse on a daily basis.	Wannan shi ne yanayin siyasar da suke ciki: hakan ne ya tilasta musu barin kasar Iraki ba tare da sun cimma wani abu ba. A kasar Afghanistan ma a kusan kowace rana yanayinsu zai dada muni yake yi.	this is the political situation they are in: this has forced them to leave iraq without achieving anything. in afghanistan too, almost every day their situation is getting worse.
722	In Muslim countries, in Egypt, in North Africa, in Tunisia, the Americans have completely lost their original awe.	A kasashen musulmi, a Masar, a arewacin Afirka, a Tunusiya, mutumcin Amurka ya zube a idanuwansu.	in muslim countries, in egypt, in north africa, in tunisia, american humanity has been reflected in their eyes.
723	Besides all these things, the Occupy Wall Street movement has started in the cities of America.	Baya ga dukkanin wadannan abubuwan, sai kuma ga yunkurin Wall Street da ya kunno kai a cikin Amurkan.	beyond all these things, there is also the ambition of wall street that has engulfed america.
724	Is this situation good?	Shin wannan yanayi ne mai kyau?	is this weather good?
725	Therefore, America is in a dire situation.	A saboda haka Amurka tana cikin tsaka mai wuya.	therefore, america is in a difficult situation.
726	America might pose threats to other countries. It might do crazy things.	Na'am mai yiyuwa ne Amurka ta yi barazana ga wasu kasashe; mai yiyuwa hauka ya debe ta.	yes, america has shown superiority to some countries; the superiority madness has ruined it.
727	And I would like to take this opportunity to say that we do not have atomic weapons and that we will not build such weapons, but in case the enemies attack us - be it America or the Zionist regime - we will attack them on the same level that they attack us in order to defend ourselves.	To a nan wajen ina son in sanar da cewa; mu dai ba mu da makaman nukiliya, ba za mu taba kera makaman nukiliya ba, to amma don kare kanmu daga duk wani harin makiya a kanmu- shin Amurka ce ko kuma haramtacciyar kasar Isra'ila - lalle za mu mayar musu da martani da kai hari daidai wajen da makiya suka kawo mana harin.	i am here to announce that; we do not have nuclear weapons, we will never create nuclear weapons, but to protect ourselves from any enemy attack on us - whether it's america or even the forbidden state of israel - surely we will respond to them with a counterattack equal to the harm they bring to us.
728	"The Holy Quran has promised us, ""And if those who disbelieve fight with you, they would certainly turn (their) backs, then they would not find any protector or a helper."	"Alkur'ani mai girma ya yi mana alkawarin cewa: ""Kuma da wadanda suka kafirta sun yake ku, da sun juyar da bayansu (domin gudu) sa'an nan ba za su sami majibinci ba, kuma ba za su sami mataimaki ba."	"the holy quran has made a promise to us saying: ""and those who disbelieve are constantly in flight, and they have abandoned their backs (to flee) so they will not find any refuge, and they will not find any help."
729	"Such has been the law of Allah that has indeed run before, and you shall not find a change in Allah's law."""	Hanyar Allah wadda ta shude daga gabanin wannan, kuma ba za ka sami musanya ba ga hanyar Allah (ta taimakon muminai a kan mai zaluntarsu) (Suratul Fat'h 48:22-23).	the path of allah by which you have been excluded from this, and you will not find any refuge against the path of allah (to help the believers on whom they have imposed) (suratul fat'h 48:22-23).
730	[The Holy Quran, 48: 22-23] Nowhere in the Holy Quran is it said that if you start a war, you will definitely win it. You might win or lose the war you start, just as the Muslims did not always win the wars they started during the early years after the introduction of Islam: they were defeated in certain cases.	Babu wani waje a cikin Alkur'ani da (Allah Madaukakin Sarki) Ya fadi cewa idan har kuka fara yaki, kuka kai hari, to lalle za ku yi nasara; mai yiyuwa ne ku yi nasara, mai yiyuwa ne ku sha kashi - kamar yadda ya faru a yakukuwan farkon Musulunci, a lokutan da musulmi suka kai hari, a wani wajen sun sha kashi a wani wajen kuma sun yi nasara.	there is no place in the qur'an where (allah the majestic king) said that if you start a war, you attack, then surely you will be victorious; the victor is the one who is victorious, the victor is the one who suffers defeat - as it happened in the early battles of islam, at times when muslims attacked, in some places they suffered defeat and in some places they were victorious.
731	But it has been promised that if the enemy attacks, he will definitely be defeated.	To amma (Allah) ya yi alkawarin cewa a duk lokacin da makiya suka fara kawo muku hari, to ko shakka babu za su sha kashi.	but allah has promised that whenever enemies start to attack you, there is no doubt they will be defeated.
732	"You should not say that this is only true of the early years after the introduction of Islam. No, ""Such has been the law of Allah that has indeed run before, and you shall not find a change in Allah's law."""	"Bai kamata a yi zaton hakan lamari ne da ya shafi farkon Musulunci ba; a'a, ""Hanyar Allah wadda ta shude daga gabanin wannan, kuma ba za ka sami musanya ba ga hanyar Allah (ta taimakon muminai a kan mai zaluntarsu)"", wannan sunna ce ta Ubangiji."	"it should not be assumed that this is a matter related to the beginning of islam; no, ""the path of allah which has been cleared from this, and you will not find any change in the path of allah (to help believers on the one who harms them)"", this is the tradition of the lord."
733	This is a divine law. The Iranian people are determined and dynamic and they are not thinking of attacking other countries, but they are firmly attached to their identity, to their wealth, to their religion, to their Islamic Republic.	Al'ummar Iran ta yi azama da dukkan nishadi sannan kuma ba ta da nufin kai hari da wuce gona da iri a kan wani; to amma tana da alaka da kuma kaunar mutumcinta, dukiyarta da matsayinta, da Musuluncinta, da Jamhuriyar Musuluncinta da dukkanin karfinta.	the people of iran have celebrated with all joy and yet have no intention of invading and taking over anyone's land; but they have a connection and love for their people, their wealth and their position, their islam, their islamic republic and all its power.
734	That is to say, when you consume domestically produced products, you help Iranian laborers, you create job opportunities, you contribute to Iranian investment, you give rise to growth and development.	Wato a lokacin da kuka zamanto masu saye da amfani da kayayyakin da ake samarwa a cikin gida, to kuna taimakon leburan Iran ne, kuna samar da aikin yi ne, haka nan kuma kuna taimakon zuba jari na al'ummar Iran ne da kuma samar da ci gaba.	that is, at the time when you were buying and using the goods produced in the house, you were helping the iranian economy, you were creating jobs, and you were also helping to increase the income of the iranian people and contribute to progress.
735	Consuming foreign products is a wrong cultural norm, which has unfortunately become prevalent in certain portions of our society. Consuming foreign products will harm us. It will stand in the way of our progress.	Wannan al'ada dake cike da kuskure - wadda abin bakin ciki ana iya ganinta tattare da wasu bangarori na al'ummarmu - na amfani da kayayyakin da aka kera a waje, lalle hakan cutarwa ce ga duniyarmu, cutarwa ce ga ci gabanmu da kuma makomarmu.	this practice is full of errors - which can be seen clearly in some aspects of our society - using materials that were produced abroad, this is indeed a disease to our world, a disease to our progress and our future.
736	The government is also responsible: it must support and strengthen national production.	Kowanenmu yana da nauyi a wuyansa, wajibi ne mu goyi baya da karfafa kayayyakin da muke samarwa a cikin gida.	each of us has a responsibility in his home, it is our duty to take care of and strengthen the things we provide in the house.
737	The Majlis should cooperate and the executive branch should make efforts in this regard so that they can boost national production.	Don haka a yau jami'ai suna da wata ajiya a hannunsu, suna iya amfani da hakan wajen karfafa kayayyakin da ake samarwa a cikin gida.	therefore, today universities have a burden in their hands, they can use this to strengthen the facilities being provided in the house.
738	And the people should also cooperate: both those who have capital and those who have the power to work.	Haka nan su ma al'umma - shin wadanda masu jari ne ko kuma wadanda suke da karfin yin aiki - wajibi ne su hada kansu waje guda don gudanar da aiki.	thus, the community - whether those who have wealth or those who have the strength to work - it is their responsibility to come together in one place to carry out work.
739	You dear people should develop a tendency towards Iranian products.	Wajibi ne ku zama masu nema da kuma amfani da kayayyakin da aka samar a cikin gida.	it is your responsibility to become seekers and also make use of the facilities provided in the house.
740	It is wrong to prefer foreign brands - in the case of clothes, utensils, furniture, foodstuffs and other things - to domestic brands while in many cases our domestic products might be far better than their foreign equivalents.	Ba abin alfahari ba ne sannan kuma kuskure ne mu zamanto muna fifita kayayyakin kasashen waje, a cikin gidanmu, a cikin kujerunmu, cikin abubuwan da muke bukata na yau da kullum da kuma abubuwan da muke ci a kan wadanda ake samarwa a cikin gida, alhali kuwa a mafi yawa lokuta kayayyakin cikin gidan ma sun fi na wajen kyau.	it's not a matter of pride, but rather a mistake that we import foreign goods, into our homes, into our rooms, into the things we need daily and also the food we eat, which are produced at home, yet most times, the goods in the house are more beautiful.
741	I have heard that the clothes which are produced in certain cities across the country are taken abroad and foreign brand names are attached to them, and then they are shipped into the country to be sold as foreign products.	Na ji cewa wasu daga cikin kayayyakin da ake samarwa a wasu garuruwan kasar nan, a kan tafi a sanya musu alamar kamfanonin waje sannan a dawo da su.	i heard that some of the goods produced in some towns of this country, they usually put foreign company logos on them and then bring them back.
742	If these clothes do not go through this process, Iranian customers might not like to pay for them, but simply because the clothes bear French brand names, Iranian customers buy them. This is wrong.	Mai yiyuwa ne idan har aka sayar da su a nan mai saye bairaniye ba zai so su ba, to amma da ya ke suna da alamar kamfanin Faransa a jikinsu, shi kenan sai ya je ya sayi wannan rigar ko wandon ko kuma wannan dinkin da aka yi a nan; hakan kuskure ne.	it is fraudulent when if they have sold them here, the buyer would not want them, but because they bear the label of a french company on them, then he would go and buy this dress or this trouser or this shirt made here; that is a mistake.
743	Domestic production is important.	Kayayyakin da ake samarwa a cikin gida lamari ne mai muhimmanci.	the equipment provided in the house is an important issue.
744	This is part of the effort to reform the norms of consumption, which I discussed with our people in this place two years ago. It is also part of economic jihad, which I discussed last year. National production is important and it must be the goal.	A fagen amfani da kayayyakin da aka samar, mafi yawan aikin yana hannun mutane ne; wanda hakan wani bangare ne na gyara irin yadda ake amfani da albarkatun kasa da shekaru biyun da suka gabata a wannan wajen na kirayi al'ummar Iran zuwa gare shi sannan kuma wani bangare na jihadin karfafa tattalin arzikin da na yi magana a kansa a shekarar da ta gabata. Samar da kayayakin cikin gida lamari ne mai muhimmanci; wajibi ne mu sanya hakan ya zamanto ita ce munafarmu.	in the use of the resources provided, most of the work is in the hands of the people; this is a part of improving how we use the blessings of the earth over the past two years in this area of ​​inviting the iranian people to him and also a part of the struggle to boost the economy that i spoke about in the past year. providing resources within the home is important; it is our duty to make this our priority.
745	Dear people, dear brothers and sisters, today we need unity and solidarity across the country.	Ya ku abin kaunata! 'yan'uwa maza da mata a dukkanin kasar nan, lalle a yau din nan muna bukatar hadin kai da aiki tare.	greetings of love! brothers and sisters in this entire country, indeed today we need unity and cooperation.
746	There are many pretexts for discord.	Akwai abubuwan da suke haifar da sabani da rarrabuwan kai da yawa.	there are things that cause differences and many misunderstandings.
747	In the case of certain issues not even two people have the same opinion. This must not become a pretext for discord.	A wasu lokuta a cikin lamari guda a kan sami cewa ra'ayi da yadda mutane biyu suke kallon lamari ya bambanta; to amma bai kamata hakan ya zamanto abin da zai haifar da sabani ba.	sometimes in a situation, you find that the perspectives and the way two people view the situation differ; however, this should not become something that causes discord.
748	Sometimes a person might have a certain tendency that might not be shared by other people, but this must not become a source of discord.	A wani lokaci a kan sami wannan mutumin yana da wannan ra'ayi, wani kuma yana da wani ra'ayin na daban, bai kamata hakan ya zamanto abin da zai haifar da sabani ba.	sometimes you find this person with this opinion, and another with a different opinion, it should not become something that will cause a dispute.
749	"The Holy Quran teaches us, ""And do not quarrel for then you will be weak in hearts and your power will depart."" [The Holy Quran, 8: 46] If we quarrel about different issues - political issues, economic issues, personal issues - if we fight with each other, our enemy will be encouraged."	"Alkur'ani mai girma ya karantar da mu cewa: ""kuma kada ku yi jayayya har ku raunana kuma iskarku ta tafi"" (Suratul Anfal 8:46), idan har muka yi jayayya cikin lamurra daban-daban - batutuwa na siyasa, na tattalin arziki da batutuwa na kashin kai - muka kama kwalar rigunan junanmu, to kuwa makiyanmu za su sami karfin gwuiwa."	"the holy quran has taught us saying: ""and do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart"" (suratul anfal 8:46), if we ever dispute in different affairs - political issues, economic matters and issues of pride - we lose control of our minds, then indeed our enemies will gain strength."
750	Some of the courage that our enemy has found in the past years is due to our quarrels.	Irin dan karfin gwuiwan da makiyanmu suka samu a shekarun da suka gabata, sakamakon sabanin da ya kunno kai ne a tsakaninmu.	the kind of strength and unity our ancestors had in the past years, was as a result of the mutual respect among us.
751	The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) teaches us a lesson.	"Amirul Muminin (a.s) yana koyarwa da mu, yana fadin cewa: 'Wanda ya nemi gaskiya amma ya kuskure, bai yi daidai da wanda ya nemi karya kuma ya same ta ba""."	amirul muminin (a.s) is teaching us, saying: 'he who seeks the truth but fails, is not the same as he who seeks falsehood and finds it'.
752	Opponents are of two kinds. One kind of opponent wants the truth, the Islamic Republic, the Revolution, Islam and God, but he might choose the wrong path.	Wani dan adawan ya kasance yana neman gaskiya ne, yana son Jamhuriyar Musulunci, yana son juyin juya halin Musulunci yana kuma kaunar addini da kuma Allah Madaukakin Sarki, to amma ya kuskure hanya ne; bai kamata a yi gaba da shi ba.	a certain seeker of truth was, he loved the islamic republic, he loved the transformation of the islamic state and he also loved religion and allah the almighty king, but he lost his way; he should not be continued with.
753	Such opponents are different from those who work against the Islamic system and pursue hostile objectives.	Ya bambanta da mutumin da ya kama hanyar da ta saba wa tsarin Musulunci sannan kuma yana kiyayya da tsarin Musulunci.	he differs from the person who has taken the path that is accustomed to the system of islam and also adheres to the system of islam.
754	Make hearts tender towards each other and treat each other with more kindness. Unfortunately these electronic and internet media outlets have prepared the ground for widespread slander.	Ku tausasa zukata, mu'amalarku da juna ta zamanto cikin so da kauna. Abin bakin cikin shi ne cewa wadannan kafafen watsa labarai na zamani da hanyar sadarwa ta internet sun ba da damar mutane su dinga fadin munanan maganganu dangane da junansu.	respect each other, your relationship with each other will be filled with love and affection. the interesting thing about it is that these modern media platforms and the internet have given people the opportunity to express these conversations about themselves.
755	However, the most important factor is that we should feel committed to observing the Islamic rules of conduct. We should feel committed to observing the law.	To sai dai tushen lamarin shi ne cewa mu da kanmu mu ji cewa wajibi ne mu misaltu da kyawawan halaye na Musulunci; mu dinga girmama doka.	however, the crux of the matter is that we should feel it is our duty to exemplify the beautiful teachings of islam; we should continue to uphold the law.
756	My statement must not be used as a pretext to criticize and persecute our revolutionary youth as extremists.	To sai dai bai kamata a dauki wannan maganar tawa a matsayin wani abin da za a fake da shi wasu mutane su je su dinga zargi da fadin wasu maganganu marasa dadi kan matasanmu masu kishin juyi a matsayin masu tsaurin ra'ayi.	however, it is not appropriate to take this conversation lightly as something that will be used to falsely accuse some people of saying unpleasant things about our youth who are considered to be of high importance.
757	No, I consider all our proud youth and all our faithful and revolutionary youth as my own children and I support them. I support our revolutionary, faithful and proud youth, but I also advise everybody to observe the Islamic rules of conduct and the law in their behavior.	A'a ni dai ina ganin dukkanin matasan kasar nan masu kishi, muminai masu riko da wannan juyin a matsayin 'ya'yana sannan kuma ina goyon bayansu; lalle ni ina goyon bayan matasa muminai masu kishin juyin juya halin Musulunci; to sai dai kuma ina kiran kowa da kowa zuwa misaltuwa da kyawawan halaye na Musulunci; su girmama doka.	no, i see all the young people of this country who are in trouble, believers who accept this situation as children, and i support them; indeed i support the young believers who are changing the state of islam; then i also call everyone to conversion and the beautiful teachings of islam; they respect the law.
758	Everybody must observe the law.	Wajibi ne kowa ya girmama doka.	it is mandatory for everyone to respect the law.
759	The Constitution of the Islamic Republic embodies the values of the Revolution.	Riko da juyin juya halin Musulunci yana cikin kundin tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci.	the rejection and reversal of the islamic way is in the constitution of the islamic republic.
760	The same is true of our government officials.	Haka lamarin yake dangane da jami'an Iran.	that's how the situation is concerning iran's authorities.
761	The executive branch must not undermine the authority of the Majlis. Similarly the Majlis must not undermine the authority of the executive branch and the President.	Gwamnati ta girmama hurumin majalisa, ita ma majalisa ta girmama hurumin gwamnati da shugaban kasa; su zamanto tare da juna da aiki kafada da kafada.	the government has commended the parliament's effort, the parliament too has commended the government and the president's effort; they will work together hand in hand.
762	They must work together and cooperate. This does not mean that everybody should think in the same way.	Hakan ba yana nufin dukkaninsu su zamanto masu tunani da ra'ayi daya ba; ba kuma shi ne cewa idan har suka zamanto suna da ra'ayi mabambanta shi kenan sai kowa ya kama wuyan dan'uwansa ba.	this does not mean that they should all become thinkers and have the same opinion; nor does it mean that if they become thinkers, they will have different opinions, then everyone should follow his brother's path.
763	I hope the year 1391, which starts from today, will be full of dynamism, activity, success and happiness for the people of Iran.	Ina fatan wannan shekarar ta 1391 wacce ta fara daga yau, za ta zamanto daga cikin shekaru masu cike da nishadi, aiki tukura, nasarori da kuma faranta rai ga al'ummar Iran.	i hope that this year of 1391, which begins today, will be among the years filled with joy, hard work, achievements, and also bringing happiness to the people of iran.
764	Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household, make our dear youth and people steadfast on the straight path.	Ya Ubangiji Allah! Albarkacin Muhammadu da Alayen Muhammadu, ka tabbatar da matasanmu masu girma, al'ummarmu masu girma a kan mikakken tafarki.	o lord allah! with the blessings of muhammad and the followers of muhammad, confirm our grown-up youths, our large community on the path of righteousness.
765	Dear God, suppress and defeat the enemies of this nation.	Ya Ubangiji Allah! Ka ruguza makiyan wannan al'umma.	oh lord god! have mercy on the people of this nation.
766	Make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age (a.s.) satisfied and happy with us and help us benefit from his prayers.	Ka isar da wannan al'umma mai girma da tsayin daka zuwa ga manufar da ta sa a gaba. Ka sanya zuciyar mai girma Waliyul Asr ta zamanto ta yarda da mu, sannan kuma ka sanya mu cikin addu'oinsa.	you have brought this great and tall nation to the promise that lies ahead. you have made the heart of the great waliyul asr agree with us, and then you have put us in his prayers.
767	Shrine - Khamenei.ir  The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 21, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of Islamic Revolution to a large gathering of pilgrims at Imam Ridha's (a.s.) shrine in the holy city of Mashhad.

768	In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful	Da Sunan Allah Mai Rahama Mai Jin Kai	in the name of god, the most gracious, the most merciful.
769	All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet and the love of our hearts, Ab-al-Qassem al-Mustafa Muhammad, upon his immaculate, pure, chosen and infallible household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.	Dukkan godiya ta tabbata ga Allah Ubangijin talikai.	all thanks are due to allah, the lord of the universe.
770	Greetings be upon Seddiqah at-Tahirah Fatima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah.	Amincin Allah ya tabbata ga Siddikatut Tahira Fatima 'yar Manzon Allah, tsira da amincin Allah su tabbata a gare ta da Mahaifinta da Mijinta da 'ya'yanta.	may the peace of allah be upon siddikatut tahira fatima, the daughter of the prophet of allah, may the trust and peace of allah be with her, her father, her husband, and her children.
771	I extend my greetings and congratulations to all the dear brothers and sisters who have attended this warm and enthusiastic meeting, and from the depth of my heart I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me one more opportunity to be present at the holy shrine of Hazrat Abul-Hassan ar-Ridha (many greetings be upon him) on another Norouz and meet with you dear people of Mashhad and the esteemed pilgrims who have come here from different parts of the country.	Ina isar da gaisuwa da kuma taya murna ga dukkanin 'yan'uwa maza da mata masu girma da suka halarci wannan taro mai girma.	i am sending greetings and also expressing joy to all the grown men and women who attended this large gathering.
772	I ask Allah the Exalted to guide our hearts and tongues to accommodate and say whatever that satisfies Him.	Ina rokon Allah Madaukakin Sarki da Ya shiryar da zukatanmu da harsunanmu zuwa ga abubuwan yardarsa.	i am asking god, the mighty king, to guide our hearts and tongues towards things that please him.
773	And this is a great blessing that every year on Norouz I find the opportunity to see the joys and beauties that are inherent to Norouz and at the same time evaluate current issues and conditions of the country among you people, take a look at our past and future and have brief evaluation of our large-scale national conditions. It is necessary for us to evaluate ourselves in the case of our personal matters.	Lalle wannan wata dacewa ce a gare na cewa a kowace shekara, a irin wannan rana ta idin Nourouz, cikin irin wannan farin ciki da annashuwa ta al'umma, in sami damar da kasantuwa a cikinku da kuma tattunawa kan batutuwan da suka shafi kasar nan, yanayin da ake ciki, sannan kuma mu yi dubi zuwa ga abubuwan da suka faru a baya da kuma wadanda za su faru nan gaba. A takaice dai mu yi dubi a yanayi na gaba daya cikin abubuwan da suka faru cikin shekara.	indeed, it is fitting for me to say that every year, on this day of nourouz, amidst this joy and celebration of the people, if i find the opportunity and understanding among you and also discussions about the issues that affect this country, the situation we are in, and then we look at the things that have happened in the past and those that will happen in the future. in essence, we should look at the future in the context of things that have happened within the year.
774	We should review everything that has happened to us and try to learn lessons for the future. The dear brothers and sisters should pay attention to the fact that we people of Iran are not the only ones who try to study, track and evaluate our issues.	Yan'uwa maza da mata masu girma, ya kamata ku fahimci cewa, mu al'ummar Iran, ba mu kadai ne mu ke sanya ido kan lamurranmu da kuma yi musu hisabi ba, akwai wasu mutane na daban da suke sanya ido kan ayyukanmu, su yi hukumci da kuma bayyana ra'ayinsu kan batutuwan da suka shafe mu da kuma abubuwan da muke yi.	dear esteemed men and women, it is important to understand that, we the people of iran, are not the only ones who focus on our affairs and hold us accountable, there are other people who also focus on our actions, judge us and express their opinions on the issues that affect us and the things we do.
775	There are certain nations that are making use of our experiences. There are also certain other nations that are studying the conditions of the Iranian nation: they become happy whenever we make advances and achievements.	Akwai wadansu al'ummomin da suke amfanuwa da irin kwarewar da muka samu. Suna sanya ido kan yanayin al'ummar Iran, su kan yi farin ciki kan duk wata nasara da muka samu.	there are some communities that benefit from the kind of progress we have made. they are keeping an eye on the situation in iran, they can be happy about any victory we have achieved.
776	If we achieve a victory, they feel victorious and if we fail, they feel that they have failed as well.	Idan har muka sami wata nasara, su kan ji cewa sun yi nasara, haka nan kuma idan wani abin bakin cikin ya same mu, su kan ji zafi da bakin ciki.	if we achieve a victory, they feel like they have won, and similarly, if we face any hardship, they feel the pain and suffering.
777	There are other people in the world who carefully study everything that we do: these people become happy whenever we make mistakes and they feel disappointed whenever we succeed.	Haka nan kuma akwai wasu mutanen a duniya wadanda suke sa ido kan ayyukanmu, sai dai su sabanin wadancan na farkon ne.	thus, there are also some people in the world who keep an eye on our activities, but they only imitate those of the beginning.
778	They are the ill-wishers of the Iranian nation.	Su masu fatan sharri ne ga al'ummar Iran.	those who wish evil are against the people of iran.
779	They too are carefully studying whatever we do. The majority of them are the same people who used to have full control over every affair of our country for many years.	Su din nan a mafiya yawan lokuta su ne wadanda shekara da shekaru suka kasance suna rike da dukkanin lamurran da suka shafi kasar nan, su ne suke iko da dukkanin lamurran kasar nan.	those people there, who for many years have been dealing with all the issues affecting this country, they are the ones in control of all the affairs of this country.
780	The Revolution came and put an end to their domination.	To sai juyin juya halin Musulunci ya zo ya gutsure hannayensu.	until the decline of islam came and shook their foundations.
781	For this reason, they are opposed to the Revolution. They are opposed to revolutionary people.	A saboda haka ne suke adawa da wannan juyin, suke adawa da gwamnatin da juyin ya samar da kuma wannan tsarin.	that is why they are opposing this regime, they are opposing the government that the regime has created and also this system.
782	Therefore, we are being watched carefully by a large number of people in the world.	Don haka muna karkashin sanya idon wani adadi mai yawa na bil'adama ne.	therefore, we are under the obligation to put humanity's interest above a large number of individuals.
783	Therefore, we should be realistic in our evaluation of our performance in the past and the plans we have for the future.	A saboda haka a lokacin da muke kallon ayyuka da kuma tsare-tsarenmu na baya da kuma na nan gaba, wajibi ne mahangarmu ta zamanto ta hakika sannan kuma ingantacciya.	therefore, when we look at our past and future works and achievements, it is our duty to ensure that our industry becomes a reality and then improves.
784	Some people in our country only see the weaknesses whenever they look at the conditions of the country.	Wasu daga cikin mutanenmu a lokacin da suke kallon yanayin kasar nan, ba abin da suke kallo sai bangaren raunin da ake da shi.	some of our people, when they look at the state of this country, see nothing but the suffering it is going through.
785	They only see the high prices. They only see the decrease in production in certain sectors.	Ba abin da suke gani in ban da tsadar kayayyaki, raguwar kayayyakin da ake samarwa a cikin gida a wasu bangarori da kuma matsin lambar makiya.	they don't see anything wrong with the display of items, the waste of items produced in the house in some categories and also the increase in the number of women.
786	I have a different outlook.	Ni dai ina da wata mahanga ta daban.	i have a different kind of problem.
787	When I look at the conditions of our country and our nation, I see a vast arena that is full of challenges, and the Iranian nation has been proud and victorious in this arena despite the will of the enemies.	A lokacin da nake kallon yanayin kasar nan da yanayin al'ummarmu, ina kallon wani shararren fage ne da ke cike da kalubale, to sai kuma al'ummar Iran su ne suka sami nasara a wannan fagen duk kuwa da kiyayyar da makiya suke nunawa.	at the time when i was looking at the state of this country and the state of our society, i was looking at a serious crisis filled with difficulties, but then it was the people of iran who achieved victory in this crisis despite all the challenges they were showing.
788	There are certain weaknesses and problems. There have been certain bitter events among the things that have happened in our country. Certain materialistic powers did everything in their power to cripple the Iranian nation.	Babu shakka akwai rauni da kuma matsalolin da ake da su; a cikin abubuwan da suke faruwa a kasar nan akwai abubuwa masu bakanta rai. Akwai wadansu mutane daga cikin masu takama da karfi na duniya da suke aiki ba dare ba rana wajen gurguntar da al'ummar Iran, su da kansu suke fadin hakan.	there is no doubt that there are challenges and problems; among the things happening in this country, there are things that are worrisome. there are some people among the world's hard workers who work day and night to enlighten the people of iran, they themselves say so.
789	And they announced this. The incompetent lady who was responsible for America's foreign policy boldly announced that they wanted to impose certain sanctions on the Islamic Republic in order to cripple Iran.	Wancan mace maras kwarewar, wacce a baya take rike da mukamin sakatariyar harkokin wajen Amurka, bugun kirji take yi tana fadin cewa mu muna son mu sanya wa Jamhuriyar Musulunci takunkumin da zai gurguntar da Iran ne.	that woman, who is incompetent and who used to hold the position of secretary of state for america, is beating around the bush saying that we want to establish an islamic republic that will threaten iran.
790	Later on, I will explain what measures they adopted, what happened and what the result of their actions was.	A fili suke fadin hakan. To a nan gaba zan yi bayanin irin abubuwan da suka yi sannan kuma a ina suka yi su din.	they are openly saying that. so, moving forward, i will explain the kind of things they did and where they did them.
791	On the one hand, there are the enemies who are making efforts in this vast arena of confrontation between the Iranian nation and its enemies and on the other hand, there are the great achievements which show the capacity, power and intelligence of our great nation.	A saboda haka a bangare guda akwai makirci da kiyayya ta makiya a wannan fage na kalubale na fadar da al'ummar Iran suke yi da makiya, a bangare guda kuma akwai gagarumar nasarorin da aka samu da ke nuni da irin karfi da kwarewar da al'ummar Iran masu girma suke da shi.	therefore, on one hand, there is sympathy and solidarity with women in this era of crisis that the iranian people are experiencing with women, and on the other hand, there are great successes that have been achieved that indicate the strength and maturity that the large iranian population has with it.
792	This vast arena is like the arena of competition between powerful athletes, which involves efforts and exhaustion, but a true champion achieves victory in such arenas and makes everybody praise him.	A lokacin da mutum ya kalli wannan fagen, tamkar fagen gasar wasanni ne inda ake kokari da nuna kwarewa, to amma zakara guda ne zai lashe gasar da samun nasara sannan sauran mutane kuma su dinga jinjina masa.	when a person looks at this stage, it's like a sports field where effort and proficiency are demonstrated, but it's only one person who will win the competition and achieve victory, then other people will continue to applaud him.
793	In this great arena that lies in front of our eyes, the champion is the Iranian nation.	To zakarar wannan gagarumin fage dai a gabannin idanuwanmu, su ne al'ummar Iran.	we dedicate this small victory to the people of iran, they are in the forefront of our eyes.
794	Anybody who studies this arena carefully and appropriately will praise the Iranian nation, just as we hear perceptive people throughout the world praising our nation today.	Duk wanda ya kalli wannan fagen da kyau da kuma bincikensa da kyau, to kuwa zai jinjina wa al'ummar Iran, kamar yadda a halin yanzu muke jin sautin irin wannan jinjinawar daga al'ummomin duniya ciki kuwa har da daga wadannan kasashen da suke adawa da kuma kulla sharri ga al'ummar Iran.	anyone who looks at this stage well and researches it well, will indeed admire the people of iran, as we are currently hearing this admiration from the people of the world, including from these countries that are hostile and also causing harm to the people of iran.
795	Among the enemies and ill-wishers of the Iranian nation, there are certain political and academic elites and certain experienced individuals who are watching the conditions and are praising the Iranian nation.	Akwai 'yan siyasa, masanan jami'oi da sauran mutanen da suka san inda duniya ta sa gaba sannan suna kallon yanayin, dukkaninsu suna jinjinawa al'ummar Iran.	there are politicians, university scholars, and other people who know where the world is headed and they are watching the situation, all of them are applauding the people of iran.
796	It is necessary to see what results are produced by the efforts that are made throughout the country.	Wajibi ne a kalli dukkanin irin wadannan kokari da aka yi a duk fadin kasar nan da kuma irin sakamakon da za a samu a cikinsu.	it is necessary to look at all these efforts that have been made throughout this country and the results that will be obtained from them.
797	Who are these people?	To su wane ne wadannan mutanen?	who are these people?
798	I will speak about this issue later on.	Daga baya zan yi karin haske kan hakan.	from now on, i will shed more light on this.
799	The enemies who do not want to see the Iranian nation making comprehensive progress are pursuing two main goals. One of their goals is to create as many obstacles in the way of our nation as they can in order to prevent the Iranian nation from achieving progress and development.	Makiyan da ba sa fatan ganin irin wadannan ci gaban da al'ummar Iran suka samu a dukkanin fagage, suna da wasu tsare-tsare guda biyu na asali: na farko shi ne cewa gwargwadon yadda za su iya, za su yi dukkanin abin da za su yi wajen ganin al'ummar Iran ba su sami irin wannan ci gaban ba.	the elites who did not expect to see the kind of progress that the iranian people have achieved in all fields, have two main concerns: the first is that they will do everything they can to ensure that the iranian people do not achieve this kind of progress.
800	They try to achieve this goal through sanctions, threats, keeping our managers busy with secondary issues and diverting the attention of the great Iranian nation and outstanding personalities of the country to issues that are not on the list of our priorities. The second goal is to deny our advances in their propaganda campaigns. Today there is a massive propaganda network in the world with thousands of different types of media outlets whose goal is to prove that there are no advances in Iran, to deny the victories that the Iranian has achieved, to magnify the existing weaknesses and attract everybody's attention to them, and to hide the strengths that exist in different parts of the country and are visible to just and impartial people.	Za su yi hakan ne ta hanyar sanya takunkumi, ta hanyar barazana, ta hanyar shagaltar da jami'an gwamnati da wasu ayyuka na bayan fage, ta hanyar kawar da tunani da hankulan al'umma da masanan Iran daga manyan ayyuka masu muhimmanci; wato hana su gudanar da ayyuka masu amfani. Abu na biyu shi ne cewa su dinga inkari da musanta wadannan ci gaban da aka samu a kafafen watsa labaransu. A halin yanzu dai akwai dubban kafafen watsa labarai daban-daban a duniya da suka shagaltu da wannan aikin don su nuna wa duniya cewa babu wani ci gaban da al'ummar Iran suka samu.	they will do this by imposing sanctions, by isolating them, by engaging government officials and other post-revolutionary activities, by suppressing thoughts and public concerns and iranian scholars from major significant activities; that is, preventing them from carrying out useful activities. the second thing is that they continue to deny and falsify these advancements that have been achieved in their media. currently, there are various media outlets around the world that are engaged in this work to show the world that the iranian people have not made any progress.
801	In his official addresses, the American president speaks about Iran's economic problems as if he is speaking about his victories.	(A kwanakin baya) shugaban kasar Amurka, a cikin jawabin da ya yi, ya yi magana kan matsalolin tattalin arzikin da Iran take fuskanta; tamkar yana magana ne kan irin nasararorin da ya samu.	in recent days, the president of the united states, in his response, has spoken about the economic problems that iran is facing; it's as if he is talking about the kind of successes he has achieved.
802	He proudly says that for example, the value of Iran's currency has declined and that there are such and such economic problems in our country.	Yana fadin cewa darajar kudin Iran ta fadi kasa, akwai matsalolin tattalin arziki a nan da can.	he said that the value of iran's currency has fallen, there are economic problems there and beyond.
803	Of course, he has not mentioned the strengths that our nation enjoys, the positive and constructive efforts that are being made in our country and the great victories that our nation has achieved. And he will never mention such things. We have been faced with this challenge for thirty years and I will present a brief evaluation of the past thirty years later on in my speech.	To sai dai kuma bai yi ishara da irin ayyuka masu kyau da aka yi a kasar nan ba, da kuma irin manyan nasarorin da al'ummar Iran suka samu ba. Shekaru talatin kenan mu ke fuskantar irin wadannan kalubalen - wanda a nan gaba zan yi karin haske kan abubuwan da aka cimma tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin din - babu abin da ba su yi ba wajen hana kasar nan ci gaba karkashin inuwar tutar Musulunci da ake rayuwa a karkashinta.	however, he did not mention the good works that were done in this country, and the great successes that the people of iran have achieved. we have been witnessing these challenges for thirty years - in the future, i will shed more light on the things that have been achieved over these thirty years - there is nothing they have not done to prevent this country from progressing under the shadow of the islamic civilization in which it lives.
804	In this regard, the year 1391, which has come to an end, was one the busiest years for our enemies.	Wannan shekara ta 1391 da ta gabata, daya ce daga cikin shekarun da makiyanmu suka shagaltu ainun da ayyukansu na kiyayya.	this past year of 1391, was one of the years in which our craftsmen were busy with their crafts and works of art.
805	They said that they were determined to cripple the Iranian nation through sanctions.	Suna fadin cewa muna son mu gurguntar da al'ummar Iran ta hanyar sanya musu takunkumi.	they are saying that we want to enlighten the people of iran by giving them radios.
806	If the Islamic Republic stands firm, remains vibrant and continues making progress, they will lose credibility in the world.	Don kuwa idan har Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta tsaya da kafafunta, ta kasance cikin nishadi da kuma samun ci gaba, to kuwa mutumcinsu zai zube.	therefore, if the islamic republic stands on its feet, it will be in joy and also progress, then their humanity will pour out.
807	For this reason, they do their best to stop us and if things get out of hand, they at least try to present a different story in their propaganda campaigns.	A saboda haka idan har za su iya, to bai kamata su bari ba. Idan kuwa har ba za su iya yin hakan ba, to alal akalla su yi kokarin cimma hakan ta hanyar kafafen watsa labarai da farfagandarsu.	therefore, if they can, they should not let it happen. however, if they can't do this, they should at least try to achieve this through their media and publicity.
808	They are pursuing these two goals more seriously than in the past: they are trying to create obstacles in our way - through pressure, threats, sanctions and other such things - and they are also launching propaganda campaigns to discount our strengths and to magnify our weaknesses.	To a yau dai wadannan ayyuka guda biyu ne suke yinsu ba kama hannun yaro. Wato kokarin hanawa a aikace, ta hanyar matsin lamba, barazana, takunkumi da sauransu, haka nan kuma ta hanyar kafafen farfagandarsu, wajen kaskantar da irin nasarorin da aka samu da kuma kambama matsalolin da ake da su.	today, these two tasks are not child's play. that is, they are done mechanically, through the use of machines, bulldozers, tractors and others, and also through their sophisticated equipment, in order to maximize the benefits obtained and to overcome the problems they face.
809	As I said, we have certain enemies.	To mun fadi dai cewa akwai makiya.	we just said that there is a kitchen.
810	Who are these enemies?	To su wane ne wadannan makiyan?	who are these people?
811	Where is the main den of designing machinations against the Iranian nation?	Ina ne asalin cibiyar wadannan makirce-makirce da ake kulla wa al'ummar Iran take?	where is the origin of these tiny microbes that are being spread to the population of iran?
812	It is not difficult to answer this question.	To amsa wannan tambayar dai ba abu ne mai wahala ba.	answering this question is not a difficult thing at all.
813	"It is 34 years that whenever the word ""enemy"" is mentioned, the Iranian nation immediately thinks of the American government."	A yau shekaru talatin da hudu kenan a duk lokacin da aka ambaci sunan ‘makiyi', nan take zukata da kwakwalan al'ummar Iran su kan koma ne ga gwamnatin Amurka.	today marks thirty-four years since the name 'wolf' was mentioned, here it is associated with the iranian people's hatred towards the american government.
814	"It would be good if American officials paid attention to this point and tried to understand that over the past 34 years, the Iranian people have witnessed things and gone through stages that whenever the word ""enemy"" is mentioned, they immediately think of America."	Yana da kyau jami'an Amurka su fahimci cewa tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da wani abun da suka gabatan, lalle al'ummar Iran sun ga wasu abubuwa ne wadanda su ka sanya su daga lokacin da aka ambaci sunan makiyi, nan take zukatansu suke komawa ga Amurka.	it is important for american officials to understand that over these past thirty years and some things that have happened, indeed the iranian people have seen some things that have made them from the time they were called enemies, now their sympathies are returning to america.
815	This is a very important issue for a government that wants to have pride in the world. This is an issue that deserves careful attention.	Lalle wannan lamari ne mai muhimmanci da ya kamata kowace gwamnatin da take son rayuwa cikin mutumci a duniya, ta lura da wannan lamari da kuma yin darasi kansa.	indeed, this issue is of importance that every government that wants to live in human dignity in the world, should pay attention to this issue and also study it.
816	America is the center of enmity and designing plots against the Iranian nation.	Su ne cibiyar wadannan makirci da kuma kiyayya.	they are the center of these trades and also maintenance.
817	Of course, there are certain other enemies, but we do not consider them among the first row of our enemies.	Tabbas akwai wadansu makiyan na daban ma, to amma ba ma ganinsu a matsayin makiyan sahun farko.	indeed, there are some other important issues, but we do not see them as top priorities.
818	For example, there is the Zionist enemy, but the Zionist regime is too small to be considered among the first row of the Iranian nation's enemies.	Yahudawan sahyoniyawa ma makiya ne, to sai dai gwamanatin sahyoniyawa ba su kai matsayin da za mu sanya su daga cikin makiyan al'ummar Iran ba.	the zionists are indeed enemies, but the zionist government will not reach the status we will place them among the enemies of the iranian nation.
819	They threaten us with a military invasion, but I believe even they themselves know - and if they do not, they should know - that if they make a wrong move, the Islamic Republic will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground.	"A wasu lokuta jami'an haramtacciyar kasar Isra'ila su kan yi mana barazana, suna barazanar kawo mana harin soji; to amma a ra'ayina sannan kuma su ma sun sani, idan ma har ba su sani ba, to su sani cewa, matukar dai gigi ya debe su (suka kawo mana hari), to kuwa Jamhuriyar Musulunci za ta rusa ""Tel Aviv"" da ""Haifa"" da mai she su turbaya."	"at times, the israeli intelligence agencies threaten us, they threaten to bring us military aggression; but in our opinion and they also know, if they do not know, then they should know that, if a mere spark falls on them (they bring us aggression), then the islamic republic will destroy ""tel aviv"" and ""haifa"" and whoever is behind them."
820	The evil English government is also hostile towards the Iranian nation.	Lalatacciyar gwamnatin Ingila ma tana kiyayya da al'ummar Iran.	the british government's policy is also fair to the iranian people.
821	The English government is among the old enemies of the Iranian nation, but in this arena it plays a complementary role as the follower of America.	Ingila daya ce daga cikin tsoffin makiyan al'ummar Iran; to sai dai gwamnatin Ingila ‘yar amshin shatan Amurka ce.	england is one of the oldest enemies of the iranian people; but the english government is just a puppet of the american devil.
822	The English government is not independent, so one cannot consider them a separate enemy. It is a follower of America.	Ita kanta gwamnati Ingila ba ta da ‘yancin kanta, ballantana mutum ya dauke ta a matsayin makiyi mai cin gashin kansa; ‘yar amshin shatar Amurka ce.	she herself, the british government, has no freedom, especially since a person has taken her as a selfish enemy; she is a puppet of america.
823	There are certain other governments that are hostile towards Iran.	Akwai wadansu gwamnatocin da suke nuna kiyayya.	there are some governments that show integrity.
824	I would like to take this opportunity to point out that officials of the French government have been openly hostile towards the Iranian nation over the past few years and this is not a clever move by French government officials.	A nan ina ga ya dace in sanar da cewa cikin shekarun baya-bayan nan jami'an gwamnatin Faransa suna bayyanar da kiyayyarsu ga al'ummar Iran. Hakan wauta ce da jami'an Faransar suke yi.	here, i see it appropriate to inform that in recent years, french government officials have been expressing their confidence to the iranian public. this is a tradition that the french officials are doing.
825	A wise human being, particularly a wise politician, should never have the motivation to turn a neutral country into an enemy.	Mutum mai hankali, musamman dan siyasan da ya san abin da ya kamata, bai kamata ya mayar da mutumin da bai dauke shi a matsayin makiyi ba a matsayin makiyinsa ba.	a sensible person, especially a politician who knows what is right, should not treat someone who does not consider him as an enemy as his enemy.
826	We have never had problems with France and the French government, neither in the past nor in the present era. However, since the time of Sarkozy, the French government has adopted a policy of opposing the Iranian nation and unfortunately the current French government is pursuing the same policy.	Mu dai ba mu da wata matsala da gwamnati da kuma kasar Faransa, tsawon tarihi ba mu da wata matsala da su, haka nan a wannan lokacin ma. To amma wannan siyasa ta kuskure ta kiyayya da al'ummar Iran ta faro ne daga zamanin mulkin Sarkozy, ita ma gwamnati mai ci yanzu ta ci gaba da hakan.	we indeed have no problem with the french government and the country, we have never had a problem with them throughout history, even at this time. however, this flawed policy that has started since the reign of sarkozy, which the current government continues, is what has caused the iranian people's dissatisfaction.
827	In our opinion, this is a wrong move. It is ill-advised and unwise.	A ra'ayinmu wannan kuskure ne, sannan kuma rashin tunani da kuma amfani da hankali ne.	in our opinion, this is a mistake, and also a lack of thought and common sense.
828	"What they call ""the global community"" is a few countries, whose main leader is America, followed by the Zionists, the English government and certain other small governments."	A lokacin da suke magana, Amurkawa suna fadin cewa ‘kasashen duniya'. Sun sanya sunan wasu ‘yan kasashe a matsayin ‘kasashen duniya'; wadanda su ne Amurka, da ‘yan amshin shatansu sahyoniyawa da gwamantin Ingila da sauran wasu gwamnatocin na daban.	when they are speaking, americans refer to themselves as 'the world's nations'. they have labeled some countries as 'the world's nations'; these are america, along with their allies like the zionists and the british government, and other different governments.
829	The global community is not at all determined to oppose Iran, Iranians and Islamic Iran. Now that we are supposed to have an evaluation of the year 1391, I should mention that the Americans started their new plans from the beginning of the year 1391.	Kasashen duniya dai ba sa kiyayya da Iran da al'ummar kasar Musulunci ta Iran. A halin yanzu da mu ke son yin dubi cikin shekarar 1391 da ta gabata, ya kamata a san cewa tun a farkon shekarar 1391 Amurkawa suka fara gudanar da sabon makircinsu; duk kuwa da cewa a zahiri suna nuna abokanta da shimfidar fuska.	countries of the world do not trust iran and the muslim community of iran. as we are now looking into the year 1391 and beyond, it should be known that since the beginning of 1391, the americans have started their new strategy; although apparently they are showing friendship and a smiling face.
830	They imposed harsh sanctions from the beginning of the year 1391 - sanctions on oil and sanctions on banking and monetary transactions between the Islamic Republic and other countries. They did many other things in this regard.	Tun daga farkon wannan shekarar ta 1391 suka fara sanya takunkumi mai tsanani kan al'ummar Iran; takunkumin man fetur, takunkumi kan bankuna da musayen kudade tsakanin bankuna tsakanin Jamhuriyar Musulunci da sauran kasashe - kai sun yi abubuwa da yawa a wannan fagen.	since the beginning of this year 1391, they have started imposing severe sanctions on the people of iran; sanctions on fuel, sanctions on our banks and the circulation of money between our banks and the islamic republic and other countries - they have done many things at this stage.
831	They show malice and opposition, yet they expect the Iranian nation not to realize that they are hostile.	Suuna nuna adawa da kiyayya, amma suna fatan cewa al'ummar Iran ba za su fahimci cewa su din nan makiya ne kuma suna kiyayya da su ba ne.	they are showing hostility and hatred, but they hope that the people of iran will not understand that they are enemies and they are not friendly with them.
832	A few years ago in my speech on the first day of Farvardin, I said here at Ali ibn Musa ar-Ridha's (a.s.) shrine that you [Americans] should be careful, that your proclaimed affection and friendship should not mean that you are wearing a velvet glove over an iron fist, pretending that you are our friends while being hostile in your hearts.	A ‘yan shekarun da suka gabata a wannan wajen, a hubbaren Imam Ali bn Musa al-Ridha (a.s) a irin wannan jawabi na farkon shekara na fadi cewa ku yi taka tsantsan kada wannan nuna so da kauna da kuke yi ya zamanto kun boye wani gatari ne cikin tsumma, kuna son ku dinga nuna abokantaka, to amma a badini kuna cutarwa.	in the years that have passed in this place, in the love of imam ali bn musa al-ridha (a.s) in this kind of response in the early year, i said that you should walk properly so that this show of love and affection that you are doing does not become like hiding a stone in a fruit, you want to keep showing your friendship, but in reality, you are harming.
833	The Americans sent special agents to prevent Iran from selling oil and transferring the money to the country. America chose certain outstanding and experienced agents to travel to different countries and even speak to heads of certain companies in order to encourage them to stop oil-related transactions with the Islamic Republic.	Gwamnatin Amurka ta nada wasu mutane na musamman da za su yi magana da kasahen duniya, su tafi wadannan kasashe, su tattaunawa da shugabannin kamfanoni wajen ganin ba su kulla wata alaka ta tattalin arziki da cinikin mai da Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran ba.	the us government has appointed some special people to speak with the world's countries, to travel to these countries, to discuss with company leaders to ensure they do not establish any economic relationship or deal with the islamic republic of iran.
834	These agents were tasked with punishing those who had financial relationships or oil-related transactions with the Islamic Republic.	Sannan kuma su hukunta su matukar suka kulla wata alaka ta kudi da kuma man fetur da Jamhuriyar Musulunci.	then they were severely punished after they established a monetary relationship and also oil with the islamic republic.
835	They started this work with full intensity from the beginning of the year 1391, particularly from Mordad.	Sun fara wannan aikin ne tun daga farkon shekara ta 1391, musamman daga watan Mordad, inda suka tsananta abin sosai.	they started this work since the beginning of the year 1391, especially from the month of mordad, where they intensified it greatly.
836	Of course, as I said a few months ago, the Americans expressed joy and said that I have confessed to the effect of the sanctions. Yes, the sanctions have not been inconsequential. If they are happy about this, let them be happy.	Lalle ya kamata in fadi - a ‘yan watannin da suka gabata ma na taba fadin hakan - cewa Amurkawa suna bayyana jin dadinsu suna cewa ni ma na tabbatar da cewa takunkumin ya yi tasiri. Na'am, ba za a ce takunkumin bai yi tasiri ba, idan suna son su yi farin ciki, su yi farin cikinsu.	it is necessary for me to say - in the months that have passed i have always said this - that americans are expressing their satisfaction, saying that i also confirmed that the vaccine has had an effect. yes, one cannot say the vaccine has not had an effect, if they want to be happy, let them be happy.
837	The flaw that our economy is suffering from is that it is dependent on oil.	Tattalin arzikinmu ya fuskanci matsalar cewa ya dogara ne da man fetur.	our economy has faced the problem of relying on oil revenue.
838	We need to distance our economy from oil. Our governments should include this among their basic plans.	Wajibi ne mu raba tattalin arzikinmu da dogaro da man fetur; ya kamata gwamnatocinmu su sanya hakan cikin shirye-shiryensu.	it is our duty to share our wealth with trust and honesty; our governments should incorporate this into their policies.
839	Seventeen, eighteen years ago, I told the government of that time and its officials that they should act in a way that we could shut down our oil wells whenever we wanted to.	Shekaru sha bakwai zuwa sha takwas din da suka gabata na gaya wa gwamnatin wancan lokacin cewa su yi wani tsarin da a duk lokacin da muke so za mu iya rufe rijiyoyin man mu.	the seven to eight years that have passed have told the government of that time that they should have a plan that at any time we want, we can close our oil wells.
840	"The so-called ""technocrats"" smiled in disbelief, as if to say, ""Is that even possible?"""	A wancan lokacin wasu da suke kiran kansu ‘kwararru' sun fashe da dariya suna cewa shin hakan abu ne mai yiyuwa?	at that time, some who call themselves 'experts' burst into laughter, saying is this really something surprising?
841	Yes, it is possible. It is necessary to follow up the issue, take action and make plans.	Na'am, mai yiyuwa ne, wajibi ne a kama hanyar hakan, wajibi ne a yi wani abu da kuma tsare-tsare.	yes, it is necessary, it is necessary to take this path, it is necessary to do something and also to be careful.
842	When economic plans of a country are built on a particular base, the enemies of that country will target that base.	A duk lokacin da tattalin arzikin wata kasa ya damfara da wani waje na musamman, to kuwa makiya za su ba da himma kan wannan wajen ne.	whenever the economy of a country suffers in a particular area, then it is the women who will strive in this area.
843	Yes, the sanctions have had an effect, but not the effect that the enemies wanted.	Na'am takunkumi ya yi tasiri, to amma ba irin tasirin da makiya suke so ba.	yes, the pesticide had an effect, but not the kind of effect that farmers want.
844	"I will explain this issue later on. This is all I wanted to say about the issue of economy. On the political front, throughout the year 1391 they tried to ""isolate"" Islamic Iran in the world."	Zan yi a karin bayani kan hakan nan gaba. Wannan dangane da batun tattalin arziki kenan. A fagen ayyukan siyasa ma, tsawon shekarar barar (1391) makiyan sun yi dukkanin abin da za su iya wajen ganin sun mayar da kasar Musulunci ta Iran saniyar ware kamar yadda suke fadi.	i will explain more about this later. this is about the economic issue. in the political field, for the year 1391, the merchants did everything they could to ensure they turned the muslim country of iran into a wasteland as they claimed.
845	That is to say, they tried to shake the faith of other governments in their relations with Iran and in the Islamic Republic. They tried to prevent the Islamic Republic from promoting and implementing its policies in the region, in the world and in the country.	Gwamnatoci su dinga wani irin kallo kallo wa Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran, wato kada su bari Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran ta yi wani tasiri da kuma fadada siyasarta a wannan yanki da kuma sauran yankuna na duniya. To sun sha kashi a wannan fagen ma.	the authorities should keep an eye on the islamic republic of iran, that is, not to allow the islamic republic of iran to have any influence and also interfere in the politics of this region and other regions of the world. they have failed in this regard.
846	What happened was the exact opposite of what they wanted.	To sabanin abin da suke fatan gani shi ne ya faru.	they always hoped to see it happen.
847	Two thirds of the nations of the world are members of the Non-Aligned Movement. Heads of other countries took part in the Tehran summit.	Kasashen kungiyar ‘yan ba ruwanmu sun kumshi kashi biyu cikin uku na dukkanin al'ummomin duniya ne. Shugabannin kasashe da manyan jami'an kasashen wannan kungiyar sun halarci taron na Tehran.	the countries of our group have conquered two out of three of all the world's nations. the leaders of these countries and the senior members of this group attended the conference in tehran.
848	Everybody felt that the Iranian nation was praiseworthy.	Dukkaninsu sun kasance masu jinjinawa al'ummar Iran.	all of them have been admiring the people of iran.
849	They said this in their meetings with us and in the interviews they gave. They also said the same thing when they returned to their home countries.	Sun gaya mana hakan, sannan kuma cikin hirar da suka yi da kafafen watsa labarai duk sun fadi hakan, haka nan kuma al'ummominsu duk sun gaskata hakan bayan da suka koma gida.	they told us this, and also in the discussion they had with the media, they all said this, and so did their community members, all agreed to this after they returned home.
850	What happened was the exact opposite of what the enemies of the Iranian nation wanted.	Wato sabanin abin da makiyan al'ummar Iran suke fatan gani ya faru.	this means all that the iranian public hopes to see happen.
851	They failed to do what they wanted.	Sun gagara yin wani tasiri.	they have quickly made an impact.
852	In the case of domestic policies, the purpose of their sanctions was to make the Iranian nation uncertain about their path, to distance the Iranian nation from the Islamic Republic and to make the people disappointed.	A fagen siyasar cikin gida kuwa, manufarsu ta sanya wannan takunkumin ita ce su sanya shakku cikin zukatan al'ummar Iran dangane da tafarkin da suka rika; su haifar da sabani tsakanin al'umma da tsarin Musulunci; su kashe wa mutane gwiwa da sanya su yanke kauna.	in the political arena, their intention is to cast this suspicion on the minds of the iranian people about the ideology they follow; to create discord among the community and the islamic system; to kill innocent people and make them hateful.
853	On the 22nd of Bahman, the people of Iran gave them a powerful punch in the mouth with their massive presence, with their enthusiasm and with the affection that they expressed for Islam, the Islamic Revolution and the Islamic Republic.	A ranar 22 ga watan Bahman, al'ummar Iran sun bada musu kasa a fuska ta hanyar irin fitowar da suka yi da kuma nuna so da kaunar da suka nunawa wannan tsari na Musulunci da kuma juyin juya halin Musulunci.	on the 22nd day of bahman, the people of iran gave them a slap in the face by the kind of turnout they made and also showed the love and affection they have for this islamic system and also the turning point of islam.
854	In the area relating to security, they tried to undermine our national security and the details have been explained to the people by our government officials in their interviews and speeches.	A fagen tsaro ma sun yi dukkanin abin da za su iya wajen lalata zaman lafiyar kasar nan, wanda jami'an gwamnati sun yi karfin haske kan wadannan abubuwa a hirarrakin da suka yi da kafafen watsa labarai.	in the security sector, they have done everything possible to destroy the peace of this country, which government officials have strongly highlighted in the meetings they have had with the media.
855	On the political front, they once again witnessed the power and influence of the Islamic Republic in the region.	A fagen siyasa na wannan yankin ma, sun yi kokarin kawo karshen irin tasirin da Jamhuriyar Musulunci take da shi.	in the political sphere of this region, they have made efforts to end the kind of influence that the islamic republic has on it.
856	In the case of the regional issues, they even admitted that no major problem will be solved in the region in the absence of Iran and its vote.	A fagen siyasar yankin nan su da kansu sun tabbatar da cewa babu wata matsala da ta shafi yankin nan da za a iya magance ta ba tare da kasantuwar Iran da kuma amincewar Iran ba.	in the political sphere of this region, they have confirmed that there is no problem affecting this region that can be solved without the involvement and consent of iran.
857	In the case of the Zionist regime's invasion of Gaza, the powerful presence of the Islamic Republic behind the scenes caused them to admit that they had been defeated by Palestinian combatants.	Dangane da harin da gwamnatin sahyoniyawa ta kai Gaza, irin kasantuwa ta bayan fage ta Iran ne ya sanya sahyoniyawan shan kashi a hannun ‘yan gwagwarmayar Palastinawa. Su da kansu suke fadin hakan.	regarding the attack that the zionist government launched on gaza, it was the aftermath of iran's defeat that put the zionists in trouble at the hands of the palestinian resistance. they themselves are saying this.
858	We did not announce this: it was they themselves who announced and insisted that if it had not been for the presence of the Islamic Republic and its show of power, Palestinian combatants could not have even put up a resistance against Israel, let alone bring Israel to its knees.	Su ne dai suka fadi- ba wai mu ne muka fadi ba - cewa idan da ba don kasantuwar Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma karfinta ba, to da ‘yan gwagwarmayar Palastinawa ba su iya yin tsayin daka a gaban (haramtacciyar kasar) Isra'ila ba, ballantana ma a yi maganar durkusar da ita ba.	they are the ones who said - not us who said - that if it is not for the establishment and strengthening of the islamic republic, then the palestinian people would not be able to stand against (the illegal state of) israel, let alone talk about confronting it.
859	In the 8-day war, the Palestinians managed to bring Israel to its knees, and this was the first time in the history of the fake and usurping Zionist regime.	Don kuwa a lokacin yakin kwanaki takwas din Palastinawa sun sami nasarar dunkufar da haramtacciyar kasar Isra'ila.	indeed, during the eight-week war, the palestinians were successful in defeating the illegal state of israel.
860	As I said, their efforts were not completely inconsequential.	Na fadi cewa kokarin da suka yi dai ba za a ce bai yi tasiri ba; na'am ya yi tasiri, to amma a gefe guda kuma ya haifar mana da wata gagarumar nasarar da daman muke fatan gani.	i said that the effort they made would not have an impact; yes it did have an impact, but on the other hand it led us to a great success that we hope to see.
861	The sanctions caused the massive domestic capacities of the Iranian nation to become activated. The sanctions motivated us to start doing great things.	Wato wannan takunkumin ya yunkurar da al'ummar Iran da kuma irin kwarewar da suke da ita, ta yadda suka gudanar da ayyuka masu girman gaske. Idan da ba don wannan takunkumin ba, da kuwa wadannan abubuwa ba su faru ba.	this means that this crisis has threatened the people of iran and the kind of development they have, how they conduct very important activities. if not for this crisis, these things would not have happened.
862	Our youth made certain achievements that would have been impossible in the absence of the sanctions. In the area of infrastructure, in terms of the achievements that were made last year, the year 1391 stands out among the previous years.	Matasanmu sun sami nasarorin da idan da ba don takunkumin ba, da kuwa ba mu sami wadannan nasarorin ba. A fagen ayyukan gina kasa, wanda a nan gaba zan yi karin bayani kai, a shekarar 1391 mun sami ci gaban da idan aka kwatanta da shekarun da suka gabata, lalle ana iya cewa shekarar 1391 shekara ce maras tamka.	our youth have achieved successes that if not for the records, and indeed we did not achieve these successes. in the field of nation-building, which i will further explain later, in 1391 we made progress that if compared with previous years, it can definitely be said that the year 1391 was an exceptional year.
863	A massive amount of work was done in the area of infrastructure, in the area of building roads, in the area of energy, in the area of discovering new oil reserves, in the area of discovering new sources of uranium, in the area of building and developing power plants and refineries, and in tens of other great industrial areas.	An gudanar da ayyukan ci gaban kasa da yawa; a fagen gina hanyoyi, a fagen makamashi, a fagen gano sabbin albarkatun kasa na man fetur, a fagen ganon sabbin wajajen da ake da karfen uranium, a fagen kara fadada cibiyoyin samar da wutan lantarki da matatan mai da sauran ayyukan masana'antu manya; wadanda dukkaninsu abubuwan ne da za su karfafa bangaren tattalin arzikinmu a nan gaba.	many national development activities are being carried out; in the area of road construction, in the area of agriculture, in the area of discovering new oil reserves, in the area of discovering new uranium deposits, in the area of increasing the production of electricity and other major scientific activities; all of which are things that will boost our economy in the future.
864	One example is the great scientific advances that we made in the year 1391.	Mun sami gagarumin ci gaba a fagen ilimi a shekara ta 1391.	we made significant progress in the field of education in the year 1391.
865	In the area of science and technology, certain things were done which were remarkable and a genuine source of joy for those who have faith in the future prospects of the country.	A fagen ilimi da fasaha, a shekarar da ta gabatan an gudanar da ayyuka masu yawan gaske da za su faranta ran mutanen da suka yi imani da makoma mai kyau ga al'ummar nan.	in the field of education and eloquence, in the past year, numerous genuine activities have been carried out that will delight people who have faith and good hearts for this community.
866	That is to say, the year in which they were determined to be harsh towards the Iranian nation, our honorable youth and scientists launched the Nahid satellite into space. They launched the Pishgam explorer which was carrying a living creature.	Wato a dai wannan shekarar da suke son kuntata wa al'ummar Iran, amma sai ga shi matasanmu da masananmu masu girma a wannan shekarar suka aika da tauraron dan'adam na Nahid zuwa sararin samaniya; aka aika halitta mai rai zuwa sararin samaniyya da ta hanyar na'urar Peshgam; sannan kuma aka kera jirgin saman yaki na zamani.	that is, they wanted to reach out to the iranian people this year, but our young and elderly scholars this year sent nahid's human statue to space; a living creature was sent to space via the peshgam spacecraft; then they also built a modern warplane.
867	When this living creature was sent into space and was returned safely, international scientists and observers were so surprised that they first denied it.	A lokacin da aka aika da wannan halitta mai rai zuwa sararrin samaniya sannan ya dawo da ransa kuma cikin koshin lafiya, da farko dai masana a duniya sun musanta hakan saboda yadda ya kasance babban abin mamaki a gare su.	when this living creature was sent to the extreme space and then returned safely, initially, scientists around the world denied this because of how it was a great wonder to them.
868	Then when they realized that they had no choice but to accept the truth and after witnessing reality and the evidence, they were forced to acknowledge it.	To amma daga baya, bayan da gaskiya ta bayyana wa kowa, sai suka ga ba su da wata hanya face dai su yarda da hakan.	but afterwards, after the truth had become clear to everyone, they saw that they had no other way but to accept it.
869	In the area of health and biomedical engineering, great achievements were made, achievements which are related to the health of the people.	A bangaren lafiya da likitanci ma dai an gudanar da ayyuka masu girman gaske da suke da alaka da lafiyar mutane.	in the field of health and medicine, activities have been carried out that are truly significant and related to people's health.
870	We achieved the first rank in the region in the area of biotechnology.	A fagen fasahar ilimin halitta, mun kasance na daya a yankin nan.	in the field of agricultural science, we were number one in this region.
871	Outstanding technical achievements were made in this area which led to the production of different kinds of pharmaceuticals.	An gudanar da manyan ayyuka, da kuma samar da wasu magunguna.	large projects are being implemented, as well as the production of some drugs.
872	All these achievements were made in a year in which the enemies were determined to be harsh towards the Iranian nation in order to deprive it from a good life and from all the products of human talent.	Dukkanin wadannan abubuwan an yi su ne a wannan shekarar da aka takura wa al'ummar Iran, don a haramta musu rayuwa mai kyau da kuma dukkanin nasarori na dan'adam.	all these things were done in this year that was challenging for the people of iran, in order to deny them a good life and all human rights.
873	In the same year, we were the first in the region in terms of production of knowledge in the area of several important scientific fields.	A dai wannan shekarar, mun kasance a matakin farko a fagage daban-daban na ilimi masu muhimmanci.	indeed this year, we have been at the forefront in various important educational fields.
874	In terms of achievements in science and technology competitions, our students' accomplishments were 31 percent more than the previous year.	A fagen gasa ta ilimi da fasaha ta jami'a, kasar nan ta samu ci gaba da kashi talatin da daya cikin dari idan aka kwatanta da shekarar da ta gabata.	in the field of education and eloquence at the university, this country has made progress and achieved thirty-one percent compared to the previous year.
875	In the year 1391, the number of our university students increased so much that we had 25 times more students than the early years after the Revolution.	A shekarar 1391 an sami karuwar daliban jami'a ninkin ba ninkiya har sau ashirin da biyar idan aka kwatanta da farkon nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci.	in the year 1391, there was an increase in the number of female university students by twenty-five percent compared to the initial success of the reversal of the state of islam.
876	The number of students who are studying in our universities is 25 times more than the early years of the Revolution.	Wato adadin daliban jami'anmu ya karu da kashi ashirin da biyar cikin dari na daliban da suka shiga fagen karatun jami'a a shekarar da ta gabatan.	this means the number of our university students has increased by twenty-five percent of the students who entered the university stage in the past year.
877	These are examples of the great achievements that the Iranian nation has made.	Wannan nasarori ne masu girma da al'ummar Iran suka samu.	this is a great achievement that the people of iran have attained.
878	In the areas relating to water, in the areas relating to the natural environment, in the area of stem cell research, in the area of alternative energy, in the area of medicinal herbs and in the area of nuclear energy, our country managed to accomplish great achievements.	A fagen ruwa, da kuma yanayi, a bangaren kwayoyin halitta, sabbin makamashi, a bangaren magunguna na tsirrai, a bangaren makashin nukiliya, kasar nan ta samu nasarori masu girma.	in the field of water, and also weather, in the area of earth sciences, new discoveries, in the field of medicinal herbs, in the field of nuclear energy, this country has made significant achievements.
879	All of these achievements were made in a year in which the enemies of the Iranian nation had focused all their efforts on stopping our nation.	Dukkanin wadannan an same su ne a shekarar da makiyan al'ummar Iran suka yi dukkanin abin da za su iya wajen ganin sun dunkufar da al'ummar Iran.	all of these were found in the year when the iranian people did everything they could to ensure they overthrew the iranian government.
880	The events that happened in the year 1391 contain a big lesson for us. The lesson is that a vibrant nation will never be brought to its knees as a result of the enemies' threats, pressure and harsh measures.	Akwai darussa masu girma cikin abubuwan da suka faru a shekara ta 1391 a gare mu; wannan darasin kuwa shi ne cewa duk wata al'ummar da take a raye, to barazana da matsin lamba da takuri na makiya ba za su taba dunkufar da ita ba.	there were significant events that occurred in the year 1391 for us; this lesson is that no society that is alive, no matter how much it is characterized by confusion and chaos, will ever collapse.
881	It became clear to us and to all those who follow up the issues of Iran that what is important for a nation is relying on its own capacities, trusting Allah the Exalted, having faith in itself and not relying on its enemies.	Ta bayyana mana da kuma dukkanin wadanda suka sanya ido kan abubuwan da suka shafi Iran, cewa abin da ke da muhimmanci ga wata al'umma, shi ne dogaro da irin karfin da take da shi, dogaro da Allah Madaukakin Sarki, dogara da kanta da kuma rashin dogaro da makiya.	she explained to us and to all those who focused on matters concerning iran, that what is important to a nation is trusting in its own strength, trusting in allah the almighty king, trusting in itself and the lack of trust in enemies.
882	This is what can help a nation move forward.	Hakan shi ne abin da zai ciyar da ita gaba.	that is what will move it forward.
883	The year 1391 was like a war game for us.	Shekara ta 1391 ta kasance wani fage ne na gwaji da atisaye.	the year 1391 was a period of testing and exploration.
884	Of course, we identified our weaknesses as well. After all, this is the purpose of war games.	Tabbas mun fahimci irin raunin da muke da su; wannan ita ce siffar atisaye.	indeed, we understand the kind of pain we are in; this is the symbol of loss.
885	In a military exercise, military units identify both their weaknesses and their strengths and they try to eliminate their weaknesses.	A lokacin atisayen soji, sojojin su kan fahimci irin karfin da suke da shi, haka nan da kuma raunin da suke da shi don su magance shi.	at the time of military training, the soldiers can understand the kind of strength they have, as well as the pain they have to endure to manage it.
886	We identified our weaknesses.	Mu mun fahimci irin raunin da muke da su.	we understand the kind of pain we are in.
887	Our economic weaknesses - which led to harsh conditions for certain groups of people - include dependence on oil, disregarding large-scale economic policies of the country and adopting policies and decisions on a day-to-day basis.	Wannan raunin kuwa ya samo asali ne daga dogaro da mai da muka yi - wanda a baya na fadi cewa hakan daya ne daga cikin raunin da muke da shi - rashin kula da siyasa da tsare-tsare na tattalin arziki da irin matakan da ake dauka na yau da kullum cikin rayuwa.	this crisis indeed originated from the negligence and corruption we engaged in - which i previously mentioned that it is one of the crises we are facing - lack of political and economic management and the kind of measures taken daily in life.
888	Government officials of the country - the incumbent officials and officials who will be elected through this year's presidential elections - should pay attention to this point.	Wajibi ne jami'an gwamnati - jami'an da a halin yanzu suke kan karagar mulki sannan kuma musamman jami'an da za su zo nan gaba bayan zaben shugaban kasa da za a yi a wannan shekarar - su lura da wannan lamarin.	it is the duty of government officials - officials who are currently in power and especially those who will come after the presidential election to be held this year - to pay attention to this issue.
889	Another great lesson that we learnt was that our country enjoys firm foundations.	Wani babban darasin da muka dauka na daban shi ne cewa tushen ginin kasar nan tushe ne mai karfi.	a major lesson we have learned is that the end of this country's crisis is a powerful ending.
890	When the foundations of a country become firm, the effect of the enemies' hostile actions is minimized.	A lokacin da tushe ya zamanto mai karfi, to kuwa makircin makiya ba za su yi tasiri sosai ba.	when the end becomes powerful, then the enemies will not have much impact.
891	In this great country which enjoys firm foundations, if government officials accept their responsibility and adopt wise measures, if managers stay together and cooperate - which is my constant advice to our government officials and managers - if our managers act in a wise and intelligent way, then we can turn every threat into an opportunity, just as we did in the year 1391 and managed to move forward.	Idan har jami'an kasar nan mai girma da kuma irin wannan tushe mai karfi suka fahimci nauyin da ke wuyansu, suka gudanar da aikinsu yadda ya kamata, to a nan ne za su sami damar mayar da duk wata barazana zuwa ga wata dama; kamar yadda a shekarar 1391 muka mayar da barazanar makiya zuwa ga wata dama ta ciyar da kanmu gaba.	if the authorities of this great country and such powerful entities understand the burden that weighs on them, and conduct their affairs as they should, then they will have the opportunity to turn any crisis into an advantage; just as in 1391 we turned the crisis of scarcity into an advantage that propelled us forward.
892	What our government officials and dear people achieved in the year 1391 will hopefully reveal its effects in the life of the people in the future.	Insha Allahu a nan gaba za a ga tasirin abubuwan da jami'ai da kuma al'ummar kasar nan suka aikata a shekarar 1391.	god willing, in the future we will see the impact of the actions that the universities and the people of this country carried out in the year 1391.
893	Of course, the economy of the country is an important issue and I have constantly stressed its importance over the past few years, but it is not the only issue. Our national security is important too. Public health is important too.	Tabbas tattalin arziki lamari ne mai muhimmanci wanda cikin 'yan shekarun nan na sha magana kan hakan, to amma tattalin arzikin ba shi ne kawai lamari mai muhimmanci ba; tsaron kasa ma yana da muhimmanci, lafiyar mutane tana da muhimmanci, ci gaba na ilimi yana da muhimmanci, shi ne ma tushe da asasin aiki.	indeed, economic development is an important issue that has been discussed in recent years, but economic development is not just an important issue; national security is important, people's health is important, the advancement of education is important, it is also the basis of work.
894	If our country makes progress in science, all the other things will become easy.	Saboda idan har ilimi ya ci gaba a kasa, to kuwa dukkanin sauran ayyuka da za su zo daga baya za su yi sauki.	because if education progresses in a country, then all other tasks that will come later will be easy.
895	Regional influence and power of a nation is the support of its independence and national security, and it is important.	Yanci da daukaka ta kasa ma suna da muhimmanci, rashin yin maula da mika wuyan wata al'umma lamari ne mai muhimmanci, tasir icikin lamurra na yanki a wajen wata al'umma da kuma wata kasa lamari ne da ke tabbatar da 'yanci da tsaro na wannan kasar, shi ma lamari ne mai muhimmanci.	respect and dignity are important, the failure to respect and honor a community is a significant issue, it has an impact on the affairs of a community and a country. it is an issue that ensures the respect and security of this country, it is also a significant issue.
896	We have made progress in all these areas.	A dukkanin wadannan bangarorin mun sami ci gaba.	in all of these areas, we have made progress.
897	We have made progress in the area of security, in the area of health, in the area of gaining international influence and in the area of controlling different events that happen in the country and in the region.	A bangaren tsaro ne ko kuma a bangaren lafiya, haka nan a bangaren tasiri na kasa da kasa da kuma iko da magance matsaloli daban-daban da kasar nan ta fuskanta.	in the aspect of security or also in the aspect of health, thus in the aspect of the country's influence and ability to solve various problems that the country faces.
898	Through its advances, our nation proved that refusing to live under the hegemony of America does not mean backwardness. This is an important point.	Ta hanyar irin wadannan ci gaban, al'ummarmu ta tabbatar da cewa rashin zama karkashin ikon Amurka ba yana nufin koma baya ba ne; lalle wannan lamari ne mai muhimmanci.	through such advancements, our society has confirmed that not living under american influence does not mean regression; indeed, this issue is of importance.
899	Powerful people of the world and colonialists - at a time when there was direct colonialism - tried to prove to nations of the world that if they wanted to have a good life and make progress, they had to live under their hegemony. And today America is doing the same thing.	Masu takama da karfi na duniya da 'yan mulkin mallaka - a lokacin da ake mulkin mallaka kai tsaye - a yau kuma Amurka tana son ta nuna wa al'ummomin duniya cewa matukar dai kuna son rayuwa mai kyau da kuma samun ci gaba, to wajibi ne ku kasance karkashin ikon mu.	those who are struggling with the world's powers and the rulers of the empire - when the empire is standing - today america wants to show the world that if you really want a good life and progress, then you must be under our control.
900	The Iranian nation proved that this is a lie.	Al'ummar Iran ta tabbatar da cewa hakan karya ce.	the people of iran have confirmed that this is a lie.
901	Our nation proved that being independent of America and other superpowers not only will not cause backwardness, but it will also bring about progress.	Al'ummarmu ta tabbatar da cewa rashin dogaro da Amurka da sauran manyan kasashen duniya ba wai kawai ba zai kawo ci baya ba ne, kai yana ma kawo ci gaba ne.	our community has confirmed that the lack of trust in america and other major world countries is not just bringing retrogression, but it is also causing further damage.
902	There were certain countries that attached themselves to America's tail and followed it.	Akwai irin wadannan kasashen da suka damfara kansu da Amurka.	there are countries like these that have had conflicts with america.
903	Thirty years of experience lie in front of our eyes. Notice what has happened in the thirty years that the Islamic Republic has been in power. Notice where the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation used to be and where they are now.	Muna da irin wannan kwarewar ta shekaru talatin. Ku duba ku ga yadda shekaru talatin na Jamhuriyar Musulunci suka kasance sannan kuma wani irin matsayi Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta kai sannan su kuma wadancan kasashen ina suke.	we have this kind of experience for thirty years. look and see how the thirty years of the islamic republic have been, and also the level the islamic republic has reached, and where those countries are now.
904	Anybody who studies this issue will realize that being independent of superpowers is an opportunity for a nation, not a threat.	Duk wanda ya karanci hakan, zai fahimci cewa rashin dogaro da manyan kasashen duniya, wata dama ce ga wata al'umma, ba wai barazana ba.	anyone who understands this will realize that lack of trust in the major nations of the world is a disadvantage to a community, not a privilege.
905	And thankfully the Iranian nation has achieved this opportunity by relying on its power, its courage and its intelligence.	Alhamdu lillahi al'ummar Iran, albarkacin irin karfi da jaruntaka da kuma sanin ya kamatanta, ta yi amfani da wannan damar.	i'm sorry, but the sentence you provided doesn't seem to be in correct hausa language structure. could you please provide a correct sentence?
906	In certain cases, we acted like this and we witnesses the resulting success.	A baya mun taba yin hakan a wani lokaci sannan kuma mun ga nasararsa.	in the past, we used to do this at some point and then we saw its success.
907	One example is the issue of producing twenty-percent enriched fuel for the research reactor in Tehran, which produces the important radiopharmaceuticals that our country needs.	Misalin hakan shi ne batun samar da makamashin nukiliya kashi ashirin cikin dari da cibiyar bincike ta Tehran take bukata inda ake samar da magunguna masu muhimmanci da kasar nan take bukata.	for example, this is the issue of providing twenty nuclear reactors within a year that the tehran research center needs, where important drugs that this country needs are produced.
908	This small power plant required twenty-percent enriched fuel.	Wannan karamar cibiya tana bukatar makamashi kashi ashirin cikin dari, wanda a lokacin ba ma samar da wannan makashin, mu kan shigo da shi ne daga waje.	this small pond needs twenty fertilizers per hundred, which at the time we could not provide this fertilizer, we usually import it from abroad.
909	They decided to use this national need to force the Islamic Republic to give in to their imposition and hegemony.	Su yi kafar ungulu ga wannan bukata ta kasa, don su tilasta wa Jamhuriyar Musulunci amincewa da abubuwan da suka gabatar da kuma bukatunsu.	they made a great effort to meet this need, in order to persuade the islamic republic to agree with the things they presented and their demands.
910	Before the conditions became critical, our youth and scientists managed to produce twenty-percent enriched fuel and they turned it into fuel rods that were needed at the power plant.	To amma kafin ma lamarin ya kai ga matsayin da zai iya zama mana matsala sai matasa da masananmu suka mike suka samar da makamashin da aka tace shi kashi ashirin cikin darin don lamunce abin da wannan cibiyar take bukata.	however, before the issue escalated to a problematic level, our youth and scholars stood up and provided the twenty percent solution that was said to be needed in the budget to address what this organization requires.
911	Our opponents could not guess that we would be able to do what we did.	Masu adawa da mu ba su taba tsammanin za mu iya yin hakan ba.	those who are against us never thought we could do it.
912	However, our government officials identified this need in time and started working.	To amma a kan lokaci jami'an gwamnatinmu suka fahimci wannan bukata da ake da ita, don haka suka dukufa, aka karfafa irin wannan karewa ta al'ummar Iran sannan kuma muka sami nasarar yin hakan.	however, in due time, our government officials understood this need and thus they mobilized, increased this kind of assistance to the iranian people and then we achieved success in doing so.
913	While they expected that the Islamic Republic would beg them for twenty-percent enriched fuel, the Islamic Republic announced that it had produced twenty-percent enriched uranium inside the country and that it did not need the enemies.	A daidai lokacin da suke zaton Jamhuriyar Musulunci za ta zo gabansu tana maula da kaskantar da kai su ba ta makashin da aka tace kashi ashirin cikin dari, nan take Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta sanar da cewa mu mun samar da wannan makamshin don haka ba ma bukatarku.	at the right time when they expect the islamic republic to come to their aid, providing them with the twenty percent of the budget they were promised, the islamic republic announces that we have created this budget, so you don't need anything else.
914	If our scientists and youth had not done what they did, today we would have to go to those who are not our friends and ask them for either twenty-percent enriched uranium or radiopharmaceuticals.	Idan da a ce masana da matasanmu ba su yi wannan aikin ba, to da a yau cikin kaskantar da kai da maula da kashe kudade masu tsada da mun tafi wajen mutanen da suke adawa da mu, mu gabatar musu da bukatar su sayar mana da makamashin ko kuma mu dinga bukatar magunguna da abubuwan da ake bukatan.	if our scholars and youths do not do this work, then today, in the midst of ridicule and mockery and wasting valuable money, we go to the people who are hostile to us, we present them with the need to sell us weapons or we continue to need drugs and things that are needed.
915	Our government officials identified this need in time and they did what they had to do.	Jami'an kasar nan sun gano hakan, kuma cikin lokaci suka fahimci hakan, sai suka yi abin da ya kamata su yi.	the officials of this country discovered this, and in time they understood it, then they did what they were supposed to do.
916	For this reason, we achieved a victory. This should be the general plan in the case of all our national issues and needs. Administrations, industrialists, farmers, capitalists, entrepreneurs, researchers and designers of scientific and industrial projects should all carry out this great responsibility, which is a rational and moral responsibility.	A saboda haka muka yi nasara. Wajibi ne hakan ya zamanto shi ne tsarin gwamnati cikin dukkanin lamurran da suka shafi kasar nan. Wajibi ne gwamnatoci na Iran, masu masana'antu, manoma, 'yan kasuwa da 'yan kwangila, masana da masu tsara tsare-tsare na ilimi da masana'antu, su sauke wannan nauyi mai girma wanda kuma ya yi daidai da hankali, na cewa kafin ma bukata ta taso su shirya da kuma wuce gaban makiya cikin makirce-makircensu.	therefore, we were successful. it is necessary that this becomes the government's system in all matters that concern this country. it is the responsibility of the iranian government, scholars, farmers, traders and miners, scientists and those who plan educational curriculums, to relieve this great burden which also requires caution, saying that before the need arises they should prepare and also go beyond their enemies in their cunning.
917	If they want to write scholarly articles, they should adopt this orientation. If they want to do research, they should adopt this orientation.	Makalolin da za su rubuta, su kasance a wannan bangaren ne; idan za su yi bincike na ilimi su zamanto ta wannan bangaren ne.	the materials they will write, will be in this section; if they conduct a scientific research, it will be in this section.
918	If they want to engage in industrial, technical or scientific work, they should adopt this orientation.	Idan za su gudanar da ayyuka na masana'antu ko ayyuka na ilimi ne, dukkaninsu su zamanto ta wannan bangaren.	if they are going to carry out scientific or educational tasks, all of them will become part of this section.
919	All of us have a responsibility to make efforts to keep our country impervious and resistant to the enemies.	Nauyin da ke wuyan dukkaninmu shi ne mu yi kokari wajen gina kasar nan ta yadda ba za a iya kutsa ta da kuma yin tasiri na makiya ba.	the burden that is weighing us all down is for us to strive to build this country in such a way that it cannot be easily destroyed and also make a positive impact on future generations.
920	"This is one of the requirements of the idea of ""economy of resistance"" which I put forward."	Mu kiyaye ta. Wannan daya ne daga cikin laziman tattalin arziki na gwagwarmaya da muka gabatar.	let's maintain it. this is one of the essential economic strategies we presented.
921	In an economy of resistance, one fundamental pillar is resistance of the economy.	A tattalin arziki na gwagwarmaya, daya daga cikin rukuni na asasi mai muhimmanci shi ne sanya tattalin arzikin ya zamanto mai tinkarar duk wata barazana.	in the economic development, one of the fundamental principles is to make the economy resistant to any crisis.
922	The economy must be resistant. It must be able to withstand the enemies' machinations.	Wajibi ne tattalin arziki ya zamanto mai tinkarar barazana; wajibi ne ya zamanto zai iya tinkarar duk wani abin za a iya fuskanta na daga makircin makiya.	it is necessary for the economic system to become sustainable; it is necessary for it to be able to withstand any shock that can be seen from the perspective of the disadvantages.
923	This is the first point that I wanted to discuss in this meeting.	Wannan batu ne na farko da wajibi ne in sanar da ku.	this is the first issue and it is my duty to inform you.
924	The second point is that the Americans send messages to us through different channels, asking us to negotiate with them regarding the nuclear issue. They both send messages to us and discuss the proposal in their global propaganda.	Batu na biyu: shi ne cewa a kai a kai Amurkawa suna aiko mana da sako ta hanyoyi daban-daban, suna cewa ku zo mu tattauna kan batun nukiliya. Suna aiko mana da sakonni, haka nan kuma suna gabatar da hakan ta kafafen watsa labaransu.	the second issue: it is that the americans are sending us messages through various channels, inviting us to come and discuss the nuclear issue. they are sending us messages, and they are also presenting this through their news media.
925	High- and middle-ranking officials of America repeatedly say that alongside the P5+1 talks regarding the nuclear issue, America and the Islamic Republic should hold one-on-one negotiations over the issue. I am not optimistic about such negotiations.	Manyan jami'ai da na tsaka-tsaki na Amurka, a lokuta daban-daban, suna gaya mana cewa ku zo a bayan fagen tattaunawar 5+1 da ake yi kan batun nukiliya, Amurka da Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran ma su zauna teburin tattaunawa kan shirin nukiliyan Iran. Ni dai ba ni da wani kyakkyawan fata kan wannan tattaunawar.	major universities and research institutions in america, at various times, have told us to come after the 5+1 talks on the nuclear issue, america and the islamic republic of iran will sit at the negotiating table on iran's nuclear program. i, for one, have no clear stance on this discussion.
926	Why?	Me ya sa?	why is that?
927	Because our past experiences show that in the logic of the American gentlemen, negotiation does not mean sitting down together to try to reach a rational solution. This is not what they mean by negotiation.	Don kuwa kwarewar da muke da ita tana nuni da cewa tattaunawa a mahangar Amurka ba ita ce mu zauna don mu gano hanya da mafitar da ta dace da hankali, to wannan ba shi ne abin da suke nufi da tattaunawa ba.	therefore, the maturity we have with her indicates that the dialogue in the american community is not for us to sit down and find a way that is safe and appropriate for the mind, so this is not what they mean by dialogue.
928	What they mean is that we should sit down together and talk so that Iran accepts their views.	Abin da suke nufi da tattaunawa, ita ce mu zauna, mu tattauna don ku yarda da abin da muke fadi!	what they mean by discussion, that's what we will sit down and discuss so you agree with what we are saying!
929	The goal has been announced in advance: Iran must accept their view. For this reason, we have always announced that this is not negotiation.	A saboda haka ne a koda yaushe muka sanar da kuma cewa wannan ba tattaunawa ba ce; wannan tilasci ne, Iran kuwa ba za ta taba mika wuya ba.	that is why we always announce and say that this is not a negotiation; this is coercion, iran will never succumb to it.
930	I am not optimistic about these statements, but I am not opposed either.	Ni dai ba ni da wani kyakkyawan fata kan irin wadannan abubuwan da suke fadi, to amma ba wai ina hanawa ba ne.	i don't have a beautiful woman like these things they are saying, but it's not that i'm denying it.
931	In this regard, there are a few things that I should clarify.	To sai dai akwai wasu batutuwa da wajibi ne in fayyace su:	however, there are some issues that need to be clarified:
932	The first point is that the Americans constantly send messages - sometimes in writing - that they are not after regime change in Iran. This is what they are telling us.	Batu na farko shi ne cewa Amurkawa a kai a kai suna aiko mana da sako, a wani lokaci a rubuce, wani lokacin kuma sako suke aikowa, suna cewa mu dai ba mu da nufin kifar da gwamnatin Musulunci (ta Iran); haka suke gaya mana.	the first point is that the americans constantly send us messages, sometimes in writing, sometimes in other ways, saying that we have no intention of confronting the islamic government (of iran); this is what they tell us.
933	The answer is that we are not concerned about whether or not you have intentions of overthrowing the Islamic Republic although you constantly insist that you do not have such intentions.	Amsarmu ita ce cewa mu dai ba mu damu ko kuna da nufin kifar da tsarin Musulunci ko kuma a'a ba, ballantana ma ku dinga fadi a halin yanzu cewa ku ba ku da niyyar sauya wannan tsari na Musulunci.	our position is that we are not worried whether you have the intention of undermining or destroying the structure of islam or not, but you should stop saying at this moment that you do not have the intention of changing this islamic structure.
934	Even the day when you had intentions of overthrowing the Islamic Republic and you announced this openly, you could not do anything, and you will not be able to do anything in the future either.	A wancan lokacin da kuka kasance kuna da niyyar kifar da tsarin Musuluncin, sannan kuma a fili kuke fadin hakan, kun gagara yin wani abu, a nan gaba ma ba za ku iya yin wani abu ba.	at that time when you were pretending to be muslims, and openly saying so, you were eager to do something, but from now on you will not be able to do anything.
935	The second point is that the Americans constantly send us messages, telling us that they are sincere in their offers of rational negotiation.	Batu na biyu: shi ne cewa Amurkawa suna ta aiko da sakonni cewa mu da gaske muke yi cikin batun tattaunawar.	the second issue: it is that americans are sending messages that we are truly involved in the discussion.
936	They claim that they sincerely want to have rational negotiations with Iran - that is to say, they claim that they do not want imposition.	Wato da gaske muna son tattaunawa da ku sannan kuma tattaunawar da ta yi daidai da hankali; wato ba tattaunawa ta tilasci ba.	indeed, we really want to communicate with you and also have a conversation that is appropriate and mindful; not a careless conversation.
937	In response, I would say, we have told you many times that we are not after nuclear weapons and you say that you do not believe us.	To ina gaya musu cewa: A lokuta da dama mun sha gaya muku cewa mu dai ba ma nufin kera makaman kare dangi, amma kuna fadin cewa ba ku yarda ba.	i'm telling them: many times we have told you that we don't mean to breed forest dogs, but you keep saying you don't agree.
938	Why would we believe your statements then?	To da wani dalilin ne mu ma za mu yarda da abin da kuke fadi?	is there a reason why we should agree with what you are saying?
939	When you are not prepared to accept a rational and sincere statement, why would we accept your statements which have been disproved many times?	A lokacin da ya zamana ku din nan ba a shirye kuke ku amince da wata magana ta gaskiya wacce ta yi daidai da hankali ba, da wani dalilin ne za mu yarda da abin da kuke fadi wadanda a lokuta da dama kun tabbatar da sabanin hakan?	at the time when you were not prepared to agree with a truthful statement that was appropriate and sensible, was there a reason we would accept what you were saying, when in many instances you have proven the opposite?
940	Our interpretation is that offers of negotiation are an American tactic to mislead public opinion in the world and in our country.	Fahimtarmu cikin wannan shawara ta tattaunawa da Amurkawa suke gabatarwa, wata dabara ce ta yaudara da kuma wasa da hankulan mutane; mutanen duniya da kuma mutanen kasar mu.	our understanding in this advice is that americans are presenting a strategy that is both entertaining and playing with people's minds; the people of the world and our countrymen.
941	You should prove that this is not the case.	Wajibi ne ku tabbatar da cewa ba haka ba ne.	it is your responsibility to ensure that it is not so.
942	Can you prove this?	Shin za ku iya tabbatarwa?	can you confirm?
943	I would like to take this opportunity to say that one of their propaganda techniques is that they sometimes start rumors that certain people have negotiated with the Americans on behalf of the Leader.	A wannan wajen ina son in sanar da cewa daya daga cikin dabarunsu shi ne cewa a wani lokaci su kan yada jita-jitan cewa wasu mutane daga wajen Jagora, sun tafi sun tattauna da Amurkawa.	at this point, i want to mention that one of their issues is that sometimes they spread rumors that some people from the jagora area have gone to talk with the americans.
944	This is another propaganda tactic and a downright lie.	Wannan wata dabara ce ta farfaganda, sannan kuma karya ce tsagoronta.	this is a propaganda strategy, and also a lie to deceive her.
945	So far nobody has negotiated with them on behalf of the Leader.	Ya zuwa yanzu babu wani daga bangaren Jagora da ya tattauna da su.	up to now, there is no one from jagora's side that has spoken with them.
946	The third point is that on the basis of our experiences and careful analysis of the existing conditions, our interpretation is that the Americans do not want the nuclear negotiations to end.	Batu na uku: shi ne cewa abin da muka fahimta, sakamakon kwarewa da kuma sanya ido kan fage da muke yi, shi ne cewa Amurka dai ba ta son a kawo karshen wannan tattaunawa ta nukiliya.	the third point: what we understand, as a result of maturity and also focusing on the discussion we are having, is that america does not want to bring an end to this nuclear conversation.
947	The Americans do not want the nuclear conflict to be resolved, otherwise if they wanted these negotiations to reach a solution, the solution would be very close by and easy to reach.	Amurkawa ba sa son a gama wannan tattaunawa ta nukiliya da kuma magance wannan matsalar. Idan kuwa ba haka ba, idan da suna son a kawo karshenta da kuma magance matsalar, to hanyar magancewar, hanya ce da take a fili kuma mai sauki.	the americans do not want to end this nuclear conversation and also solve this problem. however, if that's not the case, if they want to bring it to an end and solve the problem, then the way to solve it, is a path that is open and easy.
948	In the nuclear issue, Iran only wants the world to recognize its right to enrichment, which is Iran's natural right.	Abin da Iran take so dangane da batun nukiliyan, shi ne kawai duniya ta amince da hakkin da take da shi na tace sinadarin uranium, wanda hakan wani hakkin ta ne.	what iran wants regarding the nuclear issue, is simply for the world to acknowledge its right to enrich uranium, which is a right it has.
949	Government officials of the countries that are claiming to be after a solution should admit that the Iranian nation has a right to domestic nuclear enrichment for peaceful purposes.	Kasashen da suke takama da karfi na duniya su amince da cewa al'ummar Iran tana da hakkin tace sinadarin uranium don manufa ta zaman lafiya a cikin kasarta sannan kuma da kanta.	the countries that are struggling with power in the world agree that the people of iran have the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes within its borders and also for itself.
950	Is this too much to expect? This is what we have always demanded, and it is exactly what they do not want [us to have].	Shin wannan wani fata ne mai girma? Wannan shi ne abin da a koda yaushe muke fadi. To hakan ne ba sa so.	is this a grown man? this is what we always talk about. well, they don't like it.
951	They say they are concerned that we might go after producing nuclear weapons.	Suna fadin cewa mu dai muna cikin damuwar cewa ku din nan za ku kama hanyar kera makaman nukiliya.	they are saying that we are indeed in the dilemma that you guys will take the path of creating nuclear weapons.
952	"The ones who are saying this are no more than a few countries whose names I mentioned earlier, and they call themselves ""the global community""."	Su din nan kuwa 'yan wasu kasashe ne wadanda na ambaci sunayensu a baya. Suna kiran kansu da sunan 'kasashen duniya'.	those people are indeed from other countries that i mentioned their names earlier. they call themselves 'world countries'.
953	They say that the global community is concerned.	Suna fadin cewa 'kasashen duniya' suna cikin damuwa.	they say that 'countries of the world' are in distress.
954	No, the global community is not at all concerned.	A'a, kasashen duniya dai ba sa cikin wata damuwa.	no, the countries of the world are not in any trouble.
955	The majority of the countries in the world are on the Islamic Republic's side and they support our demand because it is a legitimate demand.	Mafi yawa daga cikin kasashen duniya suna goyon bayan Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma bukatarmu, sun yi hakan ne saboda wannan bukata ta al'ummar Iran wata bukace ta gaskiya.	most of the world's countries support the islamic republic and our demand, they do this because this demand of the iranian people is a true demand.
956	We were never opposed to the supervision and regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency.	Su amince da hakkin da Iran take da shi na tace sinadarin urnium, sannan kuma don kawar da wannan damuwar, suna iya aiwatar da dokokin hukumar kula da makamashin nukiliya ta duniya.	they agree with iran's right to enrich uranium, and to alleviate this concern, they can implement the rules of the world nuclear watchdog agency.
957	Whenever we are close to a solution, the Americans cause a problem in order to prevent reaching a solution.	A duk lokacin da muka kusan kai wa ga hanyar magance matsalar, nan take Amurkawa za su sanya wata katanka da hana kai wa ga wannan hanya ta magance matsalar.	every time we almost find a way to solve the problem, the americans would put a huge obstacle to prevent us from this way of solving the problem.
958	My assumption and interpretation is that their goal is to keep the issue unresolved so that they can have a pretext for exerting pressure on us.	Manufarsu kamar yadda muke iya fahimta ita ce suna son wannan lamarin ya ci gaba ne don su sami abin da za su dinga yin matsin lamba.	their understanding is like ours, they want this issue to continue so they can get what they will use to make a profit.
959	And as they themselves said, the purpose of the pressure is to cripple the Iranian nation. Of course, much to the dismay of the enemy, the Iranian nation will not be crippled.	Wadannan matsin lamba kuwa, kamar yadda su da kansu suke fadi mai gurguntarwa ga al'ummar Iran. Koda yaushe tabbas ba za su iya gurguntar da al'ummar Iran ba.	these numbers, as they claim, are meant to deceive the iranian people. they can never truly deceive the iranian people.
960	The fourth point regarding this issue is that if the Americans sincerely want to reach a solution, I will give them the solution.	Batu na hudu kuma na karshe dangane da wannan lamarin shi ne cewa idan har Amurkawa da gaske suna son a kawo karshen wannan lamarin, to zan gabatar musu da wata mafita.	the fourth and final point regarding this issue is that if the americans really want to resolve this issue, then i will present them with a solution.
961	The solution is that the Americans should stop being hostile towards the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation.	Wannan hanya kuwa ita ce: Amurkawa su kawo karshen kiyayyar da suke nunawa Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma al'ummar Iran.	this path is indeed: american sanctions bring an end to the prosperity they show the islamic republic and the people of iran.
962	This is the right solution: they should stop being hostile if they want to put an end to the problems that exist between us - and they announce that they really want to resolve the problems that exist between Iran and America.	Idan har suna son a kawo karshen matsalolin da suke a tsakaninmu - kamar yadda suke fadin cewa muna son ya zamanto babu wata matsala tsakanin Iran da Amurka - to su kawo karshen wannan kiyayyar da suke nuna mana.	if they really want to end the problems between us - as they claim we want to see no problem between iran and america - then they should end this hostility they are showing us.
963	It is thirty-four years that different American administrations have designed various kinds of hostilities towards us based on a wrong understanding of Iran and the Iranians.	Shekaru talatin da hudu kenan gwamnatocin daban-daban na Amurka, sakamakon mummunar fahimtar Iran da al'ummar kasar da suka yi, suke ta tsara makirce-makircen cutar da al'ummar Iran.	it's been thirty-four years since various american governments, due to their poor understanding of iran and its people, have been devising a vicious cycle of sanctions against the iranian population.
964	Since the first year after the victory of the Islamic Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, they have been hostile towards us.	Tun daga shekarar farko ta nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci da kuma kafa gwamnatin Musulunci, suke nuna mana kiyayya.	since the first year, they have successfully turned the tide of islam and established an islamic government, showing us loyalty.
965	They have worked against our economy.	A fagen tsaro, sun tsara shirye-shiryen cutar da tsaronmu; sun gudanar da ayyuka na kiyayya, sun keta mana hurumin kasar mu; sun goyi bayan manya da kananan makiyanmu shekaru aru-aru; sun gudanar da tsare-tsare na cutar da tattalin arzikinmu; sun yi amfani da dukkanin karfin da suke da shi wajen cutar da al'ummar Iran.	in the field of security, they have prepared plans for our defense; they have carried out reliable operations, they have defended our country; they have protected both our old and young for many years; they have carried out the protection of our economy; they have used all their power to defend the people of iran.
966	Therefore, I would like to give a piece of advice to American officials: if they are after a rational solution, the rational solution is that they should rectify their policies. They should rectify the way they act and they should stop being hostile towards the Iranian nation.	A saboda haka ina kiran jami'an Amurka; idan har suna neman hanyar da ta dace da hankali ne, to kuwa hanyar da ta dace da hankalin ita ce su gyara siyasarsu, su gyara ayyukansu sannan kuma su kawo karshen kiyayyar da suke yi da al'ummar Iran. To wannan shi ne karshen wannan bahasin.	therefore, i call on american officials; if they are looking for a sensible way, then the sensible way is to correct their policies, correct their actions and then bring an end to the oppression they are inflicting on the iranian people. this is the end of this discussion.
967	I would like to briefly discuss another issue: the crucial issue of elections.	Akwai wani bahasin na daban wanda ko da a takaice ne wajibi ne in yi ishara da shi, shi ne kuwa batun zabe mai matukar muhimmanci.	there is a different kind of language that even in silence it is necessary to gesture with it, it is indeed the issue of voting which is of utmost importance.
968	"In our country, elections are the manifestation of ""political valor""."	Zabe a kasarmu wata alama ce ta kumaji na siyasa.	voting in our country is a sign of political maturity.
969	Elections are the manifestation of political valor, the manifestation of the power of the Islamic Republic, the manifestation of the pride and credibility of the Islamic system. The credibility of the Islamic Republic depends on elections, the presence of the people at polling stations and their votes that elect managers of the country.	Zabe kuwa, alama ce ta kumaji na siyasa; wata alama ce dake tabbatar da tsayin dakan tsarin Musulunci; alama ce ta mutumcin tsarin. Mutumcin Jamhuriyar Musulunci yana cikin zabe da fitowar mutane a lokacin zabe da kuma tasirin daidaikun mutane cikin zaben jami'an kasa.	voting, however, is a symbol of political maturity; a symbol that confirms the strength of the islamic system; a symbol of human dignity. the dignity of the islamic republic is in the vote and the presence of people at the time of voting and also the influence of people's interactions in the national elections.
970	Elections are the manifestation of our national willpower, the manifestation of Islamic democracy.	Zabe alama ce ta irada ta kasa, alama ce ta tsarin demokradiyya ta Musulunci.	voting is a sign of freedom, a sign of islamic democracy.
971	Therefore, because of the importance that our elections enjoy, the enemies of the Iranian nation have always tried to take enthusiasm and excitement out of the elections.	A saboda haka bisa la'akari da muhimmancin da zabe yake da shi ne ya sanya makiyan al'ummar Iran a koda yaushe suke kokarin haifar da fitina cikin zaben Iran.	therefore, considering the importance of the election, it has caused the iranian public to always strive to create chaos in the iranian election.
972	They have designed plots to prevent the people from going to the ballot boxes.	Sun tsara tsare-tsaren da za su hana mutane fitowa zaben, su kashe musu gwuiwa da kuma sanya su yanke kauna.	they have set up barriers that will prevent people from coming out to vote, they will kill them and also make them fall in love.
973	Over the years that we have held many elections - including parliamentary and presidential elections - our enemies have always tried to decrease voter turnout and make our elections less enthusiastic, and this is because of the significant role that elections play in the affairs of our country.	Tsawon shekarun da muka yi muna gudanar da zabe - shin zaben majalisa ne ko kuma zaben shugaban kasa - a koda yaushe makiyanmu sun yi kokari wajen ganin zaben bai yi armashi ba. Hakan kuwa saboda irin muhimmancin da zabe yake da shi ne a kasar nan.	throughout the years we have been conducting elections - whether it's parliamentary elections or presidential elections - our women have always strived to ensure the election is not rigged. this is due to the importance of elections in this country.
974	Now I would like to discuss a few points regarding the elections. Of course, the elections are more than two months away.	Bari in fadi wasu abubuwa a babin zaben. Koda yake akwai watanni biyu da wani abu da suka saura.	let me say some things about the election. even though there are two months and something that happened quickly.
975	For the time being, there are a few points that I would like to discuss.	Amma a halin yanzu dai zan yi ishara da wasu abubuwa.	but for now, i will indicate some things.
976	The first point is that what is most important is massive presence of the people in the elections.	A matakin farko, batu na farko a babin zabe shi ne cewa fitowar jama'a kwansu da kwarkwatansu a lokacin zaben lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske.	the first step, the first issue in the election process is that the turnout of the people and their participation at the time of the election is extremely important.
977	Enthusiastic elections in the country and the presence of the people at the polling stations can neutralize the threats by the enemies. It can disappoint the enemy. It can ensure the security of the country.	Fitowar jama'a a lokacin zabe yana iya rage tasirin barazanar makiya; tana iya sanya makiya yanke kauna da kuma lamunce tsaron kasar nan.	the mobilization of people during elections can reduce the impact of women's marginalization; it can enable women to make decisions and also secure the country's safety.
978	Our dear people in all parts of the country should know this. Their massive presence at the polling stations plays a role in the future of the country, in our national security, in our independence, in our national wealth, in our economy and in all other important issues of the country.	Ya kamata al'ummarmu a duk inda suke a fadin kasar nan su san cewa, gagarumar fitowarsu a lokacin zabe, za ta yi tasiri cikin makomar kasar nan; haka nan cikin tsaro, ‘yanci, kiyaye arzikin kasa, tattalin arziki, haka nan cikin dukkanin batutuwa masu muhimmanci na kasar nan.	our community should know wherever they are in this country that their massive turnout during elections will impact the affairs of the country; this includes security, justice, preservation of the country's wealth, economic development, and all other important issues in the country.
979	Therefore, the first point is that with Allah's assistance and with the determined efforts of the Iranian nation, there should be a massive voter turnout in the elections.	Wannan shi ne batu na farko; wato cikin yardar Allah da taimakon Ubangiji da kuma himmar al'ummar Iran, zaben ya zamanto gagarumin zabe da mutane za su fito.	this is the first issue; that is, in the will of god and the help of the lord and also the aspiration of the iranian people, the election has become a massive election and people will come out.
980	The second point is that all political orientations and currents that have faith in the Islamic Republic should take part in the elections.	Batu na biyu: shi ne cewa wajibi ne dukkanin jam'iyyu da kungiyoyi da suka yi imani da Jamhuriyar Musulunci su shigo cikin wannan zaben.	the second point: it is that it is obligatory for all associations and groups that believe in the islamic republic to participate in this election.
981	This is both a right and a responsibility that lies on the shoulders of everybody.	Hakan wani hakki ne na kowa da kowa, haka nan kuma wani nauyi ne da ke wuyan kowa.	this is a right of everyone and everyone, and it is also a burden that weighs on everyone.
982	Elections do not belong to a particular political orientation or a particular intellectual and political current.	Zabe ba na wata kungiya guda ko kuma wata jam'iyya mai ra'ayi guda na siyasa ba ne.	voting is not for one group or a political association with one opinion.
983	All those who believe in the Islamic Republic and in the independence of the country, all those who care about the future of the country, all those who care about our national interests should take part in the elections.	Wajibi ne dukkanin wadanda suka yi imani da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma ‘yancin wannan kasar, sannan kuma suke ba da muhimmanci ga makomar wannan kasar da kuma kishin ci gaban al'umma, su shigo cikin wannan zaben.	it is the duty of all those who believe in the system of the islamic republic and also the independence of this country, and who also give importance to the affairs of this country and the progress of the people, to participate in this election.
984	Turning away from the elections is appropriate for those who are opposed to the Islamic Republic.	Juya baya ga zaben, lamari ne da ya dace da wadanda suke adawa da wannan tsarin.	turning back to the election, it's a matter that suits those who oppose this system.
985	The third point is that it is the votes of the people that determine everything.	Batu na uku: shi ne cewa ra'ayi da kuri'ar mutane ita ce mai ayyana sakamakon zaben.	opinion number three: it is that the opinion and majority of people is what determines the outcome of the election.
986	You should research, observe carefully and consult those you trust so that you can identify and vote for the most qualified candidate.	Ku da kanku ne zaku gudanar da bincike kan ‘yan takaran da suka tsaya zaben, ku yi shawara da mutanen da kuka yarda da su don ku sami damar gano mutumin da ya fi dacewa don ku zabe shi.	it is you who will conduct research on the candidates who have stood for election, consult with the people you trust so that you can find the most suitable person for you to vote for.
987	The Leader has only one vote.	Ni dai ba ni da kuri'ar da ta wuce guda daya.	i only have one exam left.
988	Just like the rest of our people, I have only one vote and until the time I cast my vote into the ballot box, nobody will know what my vote is.	Ni din nan, kamar sauran mutane, kuri'a guda nake da ita, sannan kuma wannan kuri'ar kafin in jefa ta a akwatin zabe babu wani mutum da ya san ga waye zan kada ta.	i, like other people, have one vote, and before i cast this vote in the ballot box, there is no one who knows who i will give it to.
989	The people at the polling station might decide to open the ballot box, identify my handwriting and find out who I have voted for.	Na'am mai yiyuwa ne mutanen da suke kula da akwatin zaben, a lokacin da suka bude, su gane rubutuna don haka su fahimci wanda na kada wa kuri'a.	yes, the observers are the people who monitor the ballot boxes, when they are opened, they understand my writing so they understand who i voted for.
990	If such a claim is made, it is false.	Idan har wani ya fadi haka, to lalle ba gaskiya ba ne.	if someone says so, then it's definitely not true.
991	Of course, unfortunately these days different statements are commonly attributed to different people through the use of the new means of communication - short message services and other such things.	Tabbas a wadannan ranaku da kuma irin wadannan kafafen watsa labarai masu ban mamaki da ake da su - irin wadannan sakonnin na wayar salula da ake aikawa da sauransu - a ta yadawa da kuma jingina maganganu ga wasu mutane na daban.	indeed, in these days and with these types of news outlets that are surprising with what they have - these types of messages on mobile phones that are being sent and the rest - they are becoming more common and also increasing conversations with different people.
992	A person might send thousands of text messages.	Mai yiyuwa ne mutum guda ya aika da dubban sakonni.	the sender is one person who sent multiple messages.
993	I have reports that during the elections, several hundreds of millions of text messages might be sent and received every day.	An kawo min rahoton cewa mai yiyuwa ne a ranakun zabe, a aika daruruwan miliyoyin irin wadannan sakonni.	i was brought a report that there was rigging in the election days, millions of such messages were sent.
994	Take care not be influenced by such things.	To ku lura sosai, kada ku tasirantu da irin wadannan abubuwa da ake aikowa.	you should be very careful, don't get carried away with these kinds of things that are happening.
995	Of course, every citizen or political activist may try to encourage others to vote for a particular candidate. Nothing is wrong with this. However, in this regard nobody will hear anything from me.	Na'am ko wane mutum ko kuma wata jam'iyya ta siyasa tana iya janyo hankulan sauran mutane zuwa gare ta - babu matsala cikin hakan - to amma dangane da hakan, babu wani da zai ji wani abu daga gare ni.	yes, any person or political party can draw the attention of others to it - there is no problem with that - but as for this, there is no one who will hear anything from me.
996	In the meantime, the people can speak to one another, give advice, try to change each other's opinion and help one another to identify the most qualified candidate.	Ala kulli hal mutane suna iya shawara da kuma taimakawa juna wajen gano mutumin da ya fi dacewa.	in all situations, people can advise and help each other to identify the most suitable person.
997	In any case, the criterion is the votes of the people.	Tabbas mizanin dai shi ne ra'ayi da kuma kuri'ar mutane.	indeed, the scale is a measure of opinion and people's perception.
998	The fourth point is that everybody should accept the rule of law, be it elections or anything else.	Batu na hudu shi ne cewa cikin lamurran da suka shafi zabe da wadanda ba na zabe ba, wajibi ne kowa ya mika kai ga doka; a girmama doka.	the fourth principle is that in matters relating to elections and those who do not vote, it is obligatory for everyone to submit to the law; respect the law.
999	The events of the year 1388 - which inflicted losses on the country - took place because certain people decided not to accept the law. They decided not to accept the votes of the people.	Abin da ya faru a shekarar 1388 (2009 bayan zaben shugaban kasa) - wanda ya cutar da kuma haifar da hasarori ga kasar nan - ya samo asali ne daga rashin girmama dokar da wasu suka yi. Ba sa so su girmama ra'ayin mutane.	what happened in the year 1388 (2009 after the presidential election) - which caused a crisis and also led to disasters in this country - originated from the disregard of the law that some people did. they did not want to respect the people's opinion.
1000	For example, the people might vote against what I want, but I must accept their vote.	Mai yiyuwa ne ra'ayin mutane ya saba wa abin da nake so; to amma wajibi ne in girmama hakan.	the opinion of the people is accustomed to what i want; but it is my duty to respect that.
1001	Everybody must accept what the majority of the people vote for.	Wajibi ne a girmama abin da mafi yawan al'umma suka zaba.	it is necessary to respect what the majority of the people have chosen.
1002	It is necessary to use these legal channels.	Wajibi ne a yi amfani da wadannan hanyoyi na doka.	it is necessary to use these methods of discipline.
1003	When what has happened goes against what we want, it is an irreversible mistake to call on the people to protest in the streets, and this was what happened in the year 1388.	Mu kira mutane zuwa ga bore na kan titi saboda kawai abin da ya faru ya saba wa abin da muke so - kamar yadda ya faru a shekarar 1388 din - lalle hakan daya ne daga cikin kura-kuran da ba za a iya cike gurbin hasarar da suka haifar ba.	we call people to the side of the road because of something that has happened that is similar to what we want - as it happened in the year 1388 - indeed this is one of the mysteries that cannot fill the basket of the disaster they caused.
1004	This was an experience for our nation, and our nation will always stand up against such events.	Lalle hakan ya zamanto darasi ga al'ummar Iran, kuma al'ummar Iran za su tsaya kyam wajen tinkarar sake faruwar hakan.	indeed, this has become a concern for the people of iran, and the iranian people will remain vigilant in anticipation of this happening again.
1005	The last point is that everybody should know that the characteristics that are needed in the next president include the existing advantages [of previous presidents] minus the weaknesses.	Batu na karshe shi ne cewa ya kamata kowa ya san cewa abin da muke bukata daga wajen shugaban kasa mai zuwa shi ne abubuwa masu kyau da (shugabannin da suka gabata) suke da su ba tare da irin raunin da ake da shi ba.	the final point is that everyone should know that what we need from the president is good things that (previous leaders) had without the kind of suffering we are experiencing.
1006	Every incoming president should enjoy the advantages that his predecessors had and should not suffer from the weaknesses that the previous presidents had.	Ya kamata kowa ya san cewa wajibi ne shugaban kasa na kowane zamani ya zamanto yana da kyawawan abubuwan da shugaban kasar da ya tafi yake da su, amma ba tare da raunin da ya ke da su ba.	everyone should know that it is the duty of the head of state at any time to inherit the good things that the previous head of state left, but not the problems he had.
1007	After all, every person has his own strengths and weaknesses.	Kowa dai yana da bangaren karfinsa da kuma bangaren da ya ke da rauni.	everyone has their strengths and also areas where they are weak.
1008	Presidents too have their own strengths and weakness.	Shugabannin kasa - shin na yanzu ne ko kuma wanda zai zo nan gaba - suna da bangarori na karfi da kuma rauni.	the country's leaders - whether current or future - have strong concerns and challenges.
1009	The strengths that the incumbent government and President enjoy should exist in the next president as well.	Wajibi ne shugaba mai zuwa ya zamanto yana da abubuwan da ake kirga su a yau a matsayin bangaren karfi na gwamnati da kuma shugaban kasa na yanzu.	it is necessary for the incoming leader to become familiar with the issues being discussed today as a powerful government sector and the current head of state.
1010	That is to say, the governments that come to power one after the other should help us move towards improvement and perfection and gradually we should move towards choosing the best among us.	Wato wajibi ne a cikin gwamnatocin da muke da su, wadanda suke zuwa su tafi, wajibi ne su zamanto sun kama hanyar ci gaba da kuma kammala junansu.	it is the responsibility of the governments we have, those who come and go, it is their duty to ensure they pave the way for progress and also complete their tenure.
1011	Those who prepare themselves to enter this arena should move forward with full power and confidence while relying on God.	Mutanen da suke a shirye su shigo wannan fagen, wajibi ne su shigo da dukkan karfi da dogaro da Allah da kuma dogaro da irin karfin da wannan al'ummar ta ke da shi.	the people who are preparing to enter this stage, it is their duty to enter with all their strength and trust in god, and also trust in the strength that this community has.
1012	Dear God, ordain what is in the interest of this country and this nation.	Ya Ubangiji Allah! Ka ba wa wannan al'ummar abin da zai zamanto mai amfani da kuma alheri a gare ta.	oh lord allah! grant this community something that will be beneficial and good for it.
1013	Dear God, make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake) satisfied with all of us.	Ya Ubangiji Allah! Ka sanya ran mai girma Waliyul Asr ta yi farin ciki da da dukkaninmu.	oh lord allah! make the great day of waliyul asr joyful for all of us.
1014	Dear God, make the immaculate soul of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) and the pure souls of our martyrs satisfied and happy with us.	Ya Ubangiji Allah! Ka faranta ran mai girma Imam Khumaini da ruhin shahidanmu da mu.	oh lord god! bless the great day of imam khumaini with the spirit of our martyrs and us.
1015	Make what we said serve Your cause and accept it from us out of Your generosity.	Ka sanya abubuwan da muka fadi su zamanto saboda da kai da kuma tafarkinka, sannan kuma ka amince da hakan albakarcin karimcinka.	put the things we said in place because of your arrogance and your pride, then accept it as your foolishness.
1016	Leader’s Address to People Active in Economic Sector - Khamenei.ir  The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 18, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with a number of people from economic sectors of the country.	Jawabin Jagora Yayin Ganawa Da Masu Gudanar Da Ayyuka A Bangaren Tattalin Arziki Shimfida: A ranar laraba 17, Augustan 2011 wacce ta yi daidai da ranar 16 ga watan Ramalana mai alfarma ne, Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci Ayatullah Sayyid Ali Khamenei ya gana da wasu daga cikin masu gudanar da ayyukansu a bangaren tattalin arziki, jami'an gwamnati da sauran ‘yan kasuwa inda suka tattauna kan yanayin tattalin arzikin kasar Iran.	the leader's response during a meeting with economic stakeholders: on wednesday, august 17, 2011, which coincided with the 16th of the blessed month of ramadan, the leader of the islamic revolution ayatollah sayyid ali khamenei met with some of the economic stakeholders, government officials and other market players where they discussed the state of iran's economy.
1017	In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful	Da Sunan Allah Mai Rahama Mai Jin Kai	in the name of god, the most gracious, the most merciful.
1018	First of all, I would like to welcome you dear friends who are active in different economic sectors of the country.	Da farko dai ina yi wa ‘yan'uwa masu girma, masu gudanar da ayyukansu a bangarori daban-daban na tattalin arzikin kasar nan, barka da zuwa.	firstly, i welcome my esteemed compatriots, who are conducting their affairs in various sectors of the country's economy, welcome.
1019	The meeting is the symbol of the government's serious attention to the issue of economy in the current sensitive conditions of the world, the region and the country.	A wani bangare taron mu na yau taro ne da ke nuni da wani lamari, wato alamar irin muhimmancin da wannan tsarin ya ke ba wa lamarin tattalin arziki a irin wannan yanayi mai tsananin muhimmanci na duniya, wannan yanki da kuma kasar nan.	in a part of our meeting today, the meeting pointed to an issue, indicating the importance that this system gives to the economic issue in this period of great importance in the world, this region and also this country.
1020	This was my primary purpose for holding this meeting. I wanted to arrange a meeting in the month of Ramadan with those who are active in public and private economic sectors. I wanted to spend a few hours listening to them and I wanted the meeting to be reflected by our domestic media as a sign that the Islamic Republic should pay serious attention to the issue of economy, economic activities and economic progress and that the government and the people should cooperate and make efforts in this regard for reasons which I will speak about later on.	Mu muna son ne a sami wata rana daga cikin ranakun watan Ramalana ya zamana gungun masu gudanar da ayyukansu a bangaren tattalin arziki na gwamnati, na ‘yan kasuwa da sauran bangarori daban-daban su zo wannan waje, mu zauna, mu saurari abubuwan da suke da shi na wasu sa'oi sannan kuma a watsa shi a cikin kasar nan, don tabbatar da cewa wajibi ne wannan tsari ya ba wa lamarin tattalin arziki da ci gaban tattalin arziki irin wannan muhimmanci, sannan ita kuma gwamnati - a yanayi na gaba daya wato hukuma - da sauran mutane su yi aiki tare da kuma kokari a wannan fagen saboda dalilan da zan yi ishara da su nan gaba.	we want to find a day from the days of the month of ramadan to become a large gathering of those conducting their activities in the economic sector of the government, market people and other different sectors to come to this place, sit, listen to what they have to say at some point and then broadcast it within this country, to ensure that it is mandatory this system gives the economic matter and the advancement of the economy such importance, then also the government - in a forward-looking manner i.e. authority - and other people should work together and also strive in this aspect for reasons that i will point out later.
1021	This was the first purpose and it has already been fulfilled because the meeting will be reflected in the media.	To wannan shi ne lamari na farko; an kuma tabbatar da shi sannan kuma za a gabatar da abin da ya gudana a wannan taron.	this is the first issue; it has also been confirmed and then what happened at this event will be presented.
1022	This is a message to everybody - including government officials in economic sectors, those who are active in economic sectors throughout the country and all our people. The message is that today we should pay serious attention to the issue of economy.	Wannan wani sako ne ga kowa; shin jami'an gwamnati ne a bangaren tattalin arziki, haka nan kuma masu gudanar da ayyukan tattalin arziki a dukkanin bangarorin kasar nan, haka nan ga sauran mutane wadanda wajibi ne a yau su ba wa lamarin tattalin arziki irin wannan muhimmanci.	this is a message for everyone; whether government officials in the economic sector, those who carry out economic activities in all regions of this country, and other people who are obliged today to give economic issues this kind of importance.
1023	The second purpose of this meeting - which has thankfully been fulfilled - was to get those who do not work for the government to present the people with a report about the realities in the country, the advances that have been made and the activities that are being carried out.	Lamari na biyu wanda shirya wannan taron ya sami damar samar da shi sannan kuma alhamdu lillahi haka lamarin ya ke, shi ne ba da dama ga wadanda ba jami'an gwamnati su gabatar da wani rahoto dangane da hakikanin yanayin kasar nan, ci gaban kasar nan, irin yunkurin da ake yi sannan kuma su isa zuwa ga kunnuwan mutane.	this is the second issue that the organizer of this event had the opportunity to prepare and then also thank god that's how the issue is, it is not enough for those who are not government officials to present a report on the reality of the state of this country, the progress of this country, the kind of effort being made there and then they can reach the hearts of the people.
1024	No, everybody knows my opinion in this regard. I believe that we should see both the positive and the negative points. But I believe today the important point is that our people should know what outcomes their efforts, the efforts of our government officials and the enormous human capacities in the country have produced.	Ba wai ina cewa a ko da yaushe a kuma kullum a dinga fadin irin ci gaban da aka samu ba ne kawai; kowa dai ya san ra'ayi na; ni na yi imani da cewa wajibi ne a dinga fadin nasarorin da aka samu tare kuma da gazawar da ake da ita don a dinga kallonsu tare; to amma abin da a yau na ke ganin yake da muhimmanci, shi ne cewa mutanen wannan kasar su fahimci irin sakamakon da aka samu albarkacin himmarsu, himmar jami'an gwamnati da kuma albarkatu daban-daban da ake da su a kasar nan.	it's not that i always say that the progress made is not just about expressing my opinion; i believe it is necessary to talk about the successes achieved and the challenges faced in order to scrutinize them together; but what i see as important today is that the people of this country understand the kind of results achieved through their efforts, the efforts of government officials, and the various blessings in this country.
1025	You should know that I am in contact with the people: they do not know about these advances.	Ina son in sanar da ku cewa; ni dai ina da alaka da mutane; mutane ba su da labara kan irin wadannan ci gaban da aka samu.	i want to inform you that; i do have relationships with people; people who have no information about these kinds of progress that have been made.
1026	The majority of the people do not know about what you said today about different areas. I took notes and by Allah's favor, a detailed report will be prepared.	Wadannan abubuwan da a halin yanzu kuka fadi da suka shafi bangarori daban-daban - wanda na rubuta su a takaice sannan kuma za a shirya rahoto kansu insha Allahu - lalle a mafi yawan lokuta mutane ba su da labarin hakan.	these things that you are currently talking about that concern various topics - which i have written down in detail and will also prepare their report god willing - indeed, in most cases, people are not aware of this.
1027	We see that great achievements are being made in the country and the honor belongs to the Iranian nation.	Ana ci gaba da gudanar da ayyuka masu girma a kasar nan, wannan wani abin alfahari ne ga al'ummar Iran.	continuing to carry out large-scale projects in this country is a matter of pride for the people of iran.
1028	It is the people who are doing these things.	Ci gaba ne na al'ummar Iran.	the progress of the iranian people continues.
1029	We have made good advances in sectors related to production, services, agriculture, industry, knowledge-based industries and different other areas which were discussed in this meeting.	Mun sami ci gaba da kyau a bangaren samar da kayayyakin da ake bukata, a bangaren hidima, a bangaren aikin gona, a bangaren masana'antu da sauran bangarori na ilimi da sauransu da aka ambace su a nan.	we have made progress in providing the necessary materials in the field of service, in the field of agriculture, in the field of science and other educational fields and others mentioned here.
1030	It is good if people hear these things from individuals in charge of different sectors who are independent of the government. These things would make the people hopeful and happy.	Lalle lamari ne mai kyau mutane su ji hakan daga bakin jami'an bangarori daban-daban wadanda ba na gwamnati ba; hakan lamari ne da zai kara wa mutane karfin gwuiwa da kuma sanya su farin ciki.	henna is a good thing for people to hear from various independent researchers who are not government; this is a matter that will give people more strength and also make them happy.
1031	All of us should pay attention to the point that one of the techniques that the enemies of the Iranian nation use in their psychological warfare is to spread despair among the people. I stress this point.	Yana da kyau dukkaninmu mu fahimci wannan lamarin na cewa a yau daya daga cikin hanyoyin yakin kwakwalwa na makiyan al'ummar Iran shi ne kashe wa mutane gwuiwa. Lalle ina kira da a lura da wannan lamarin sosai.	it is important for all of us to understand this issue that today one of the ways of warfare against the people of iran is to kill people with poison. indeed, i strongly draw attention to this issue.
1032	The tone should not undermine the existing hope and determination.	Bai kamata abin da za a fadin ya zamanto mai kashe gwuiwa da kawar da fata da kuma himmar da ake da ita ba.	it should not be said that what will become is a killer of chickens and a destroyer of women and also the ambition that is associated with it.
1033	The tone should convey the feeling that, for example, forty percent of the job has been done and that the ground has been prepared for the other sixty percent to be done.	Lalle wajibi ne a ji cewa muna da wani ci gaban da muka samu, a matsayin misali (an sami ci gaba na) kashi arba'in cikin dari, sauran kashi sittin din kuma akwai hanyoyi da damar da za a iya cike shi.	it is imperative to note that we have a certain progress that we have achieved, for example (we have achieved progress) forty percent out of a hundred, the remaining sixty percent and there are ways and opportunities that can be filled.
1034	"One point is that I named this year ""The Year of Economic Jihad""."	Lamari na farko shi ne cewa mun sanya wa shekarar bana (shekarar 1390 hijira shamsiyya) sunan ‘Shekarar Kokarin Bunkasa Tattalin Arziki'.	the first point is that we named the past year (the year 1390 hijri shamsi) 'the year of economic development efforts'.
1035	The policy of the arrogant powers is to defeat the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic by using the economy.	Siyasar ma'abota girman kai dai ita ce cutar da al'ummar Iran da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci a fagen tattalin arziki.	the politics of self-importance is indeed the disease of the iranian people and the islamic republic's economic system.
1036	Although the sanctions have been imposed on us under the pretext of the nuclear issue, they are lying. The nuclear issue is not the reason behind the sanctions.	Duk da cewa sun fake da batun makamashin nukiliya wajen sanya takunkumin tattalin arziki, to amma hakan karya ce; lamarin nukiliya ba shi ne dalilin sanya wadannan takunkumin ba.	even though they have been accused of using nuclear power to boost the economy, this is a lie; nuclear issues are not the reason for these economic boosts.
1037	You may remember that the major sanctions which were initially imposed on our country happened at a time when there was no mention of nuclear energy in the country.	Mai yiyuwa ne kuna iya tunawa, a lokacin da suka sanya babban takunkumi (na farko) wanda kuma shi ne mafarin takunkumin da suka sanya wa kasar nan, a lokacin ma dai babu wata maganar nukiliya a kasar nan.	the one who remembers, you can recall, at the time they installed the first large telescope (the first) which was also the pride of the telescope they gave to this country, at that time there was no talk of nuclear in this country.
1038	"For example, the sanctions known as the ""D'Amato-Kennedy Bill"" - which were of course not very important and were proposed and followed up in the US Congress by somebody called D'Amato - were passed when the issue of nuclear energy was not even being discussed."	"Duk da cewa ba wani takunkumi ne mai muhimmanci ba, to amma dai har yanzu sunansa na nan, wato takunkumi ne da aka fi saninsa da sunan takunkumin ""D'Amato"" - wanda takunkumi ne da wani mutum ne mai wannan sunan da ya gabatar da shi a majalisar Amurka - wannan takunkumin dai na wani lokaci ne wanda a lokacin babu ma wata maganar nukiliya ma."	"even though it's not an important turtle, but its name is still there, a turtle known more by the name ""d'amato"" - a turtle named after a person who presented it in the american assembly - this turtle was from a time when there was no nuclear talk."
1039	The goal of the sanctions that have been imposed on us is to cripple our economy.	Manufar takunkumin ita ce gurguntar da tattalin arzikin (kasar Iran).	the production of saffron is the main source of income (in iran).
1040	Of course the Iranian nation has the honor of having tolerated these sanctions for 32 years.	To amma abin alfahari shi ne cewa shekaru talatin da biyu kenan al'ummar Iran suka jure wa wannan takunkumin.	however, the pride is that for thirty-two years, the people of iran have pledged allegiance to this flag.
1041	Of course the sanctions that have been imposed on us during the recent years have grown in number and variety. However, the growth is insignificant compared to the growth in the number and variety of constructive activities in the country. Thirty years ago when they started imposing sanctions on us, their sanctions were more likely to hurt us than the sanctions that they currently impose on us and they repeatedly promise that they will increase their sanctions.	Ko da ya ke a shekarun baya-bayan nan an fadada takunkumin, to amma sakamakon irin ci gaban ayyukan gina kasa daban-daban a kasar nan wadannan takunkumnin sun zamanto ba a bakin komai ba. Shekaru talatin kenan da fara sanya wadannan takunkumin, mai yiyuwa ne takunkumin (wancan lokacin) su fi cutar da mu a kan irin takunkumin da a halin yanzu ake sanya mana da kuma gudanar da su kamar yadda kuma suke ci gaba da alkawarin cewa za a kara su.	even though these types of aircraft have been in existence for many years, the result of the advancement of various construction activities in the country has meant that these aircraft are no longer in use. it's been thirty years since we started using these aircraft, which are more harmful to us than the aircraft we currently use and operate, and they continue to promise to increase them.
1042	It is necessary to become familiar with the opposing camp. It is necessary to become familiar with the enemy's tools and weapons and to prepare weapons that would make his weapons ineffective.	A saboda haka wajibi ne a shirya masa. Wajibi ne a fahimci masu adawa da mu, a fahimci irin makami da kyayyakin aikin da suke amfani da su sannan kuma a shirya makaman fada da su.	therefore, it is necessary to prepare for him. it is necessary to understand our enemies, to understand the kind of weapons and tools they use, and then to prepare strategies to confront them.
1043	This requires economic jihad.	Ko shakka babu hakan yana bukatar jihadi (kokari) na tattalin arziki.	there is no doubt that this requires economic effort (hard work).
1044	Not all activities can be called jihad.	Ba kowani yunkuri ne ake kiransa da sunan jihadi ba.	not every effort is called jihad.
1045	Only certain kinds of activities with certain characteristics can be called jihad.	Wani yunkuri mai wasu siffofi ne ake kiransa da jihadi.	an attempt with some characteristics is being called a jihad.
1046	One of the main characteristics of jihad is being faced with an aggressive position.	Yunkurin fuskantar irin wannan kokari mai cike da manufa ta kiyayya, daya ne daga cikin sharadi na asali na jihadi.	the attempt to face such a daunting effort filled with genuine risk, is one of the fundamental challenges of the struggle.
1047	An activity with such characteristics can be called jihad.	Irin wannan yunkuri sunansa jihadi.	this kind of effort is called jihad.
1048	Therefore, economic jihad means the Iranian nation's persistent, comprehensive and purposeful movement with the intention of rendering the aggressive and spiteful efforts of the enemy ineffective.	A saboda haka jihadi na tattalin arziki yana nufin yunkuri da ake ci gaba da yinsa wanda kuma ya kame ko ina na al'ummar Iran da manufar kashe wutar kiyayyar makiya.	therefore, economic jihad means striving to continue it, which also captures where the people of iran are with the intention of conserving water resources.
1049	The next point is that in the 20-Year Strategic Plan - which is an essential and high-level document for reference - our country is supposed to achieve the top position in the region in important and vital areas. We need to achieve this position.	Wani lamarin kuma na daban shi ne cewa a shirin ci gaban kasa - wanda wani shiri ne mai muhimmancin gaske na ciyar da kasa gaba - mun shirya wani tsari na ciyar da kasar nan gaba a bangarori masu muhimmanci na rayuwa da kai ta matsayi na daya; wajibi ne mu kai ga wannan matsayi na kolin.	another issue is that in the plan for national development - which is a truly important plan for moving the country forward - we have prepared a scheme for advancing this country in important areas of life to a first-class level; it is our duty to reach this level of excellence.
1050	Naturally others will not stand by and watch us achieve the first position. They are working hard.	Na'am sauran al'ummomi ma ba za su zauna su zuba mana ido mu zama na farko ba; su ma suna nan suna ci gaba da yunkurinsu, suna ta kokarinsu.	yes, other communities will not sit and watch us take the lead; they are also there, continuing their efforts, making their attempts.
1051	We are witness to strenuous economic efforts by some of the regional countries in areas in which we want to become the top country. Of course we are not using some of the means that they are currently using and we will never do so.	Ko da ya ke mu din nan ba ma amfani da wasu hanyoyin da suke amfani da su, kuma ba za mu taba amfani da su ba; mu dai muna bin mafi tsarkin tafarki da kyawunsa ne; to amma mun yi amanna da cewa za a iya isa ga wannan mataki na farkon, matukar dai muka tsara irin saurin aikin da muke yi.	even though we are not using some of the methods they are using, and we will never use them; we are focusing on the most important aspect of the journey and its beauty; but we have hope that we will be able to reach this stage at the beginning, especially since we have planned the kind of quick work we are doing.
1052	Therefore, this requires jihad.	A saboda haka wannan lamarin yana bukatar jihadi (kokari).	therefore, this issue requires effort (hard work).
1053	We need both speed and prudence so that we can achieve the first position.	Wajibi ne wannan kokarin ya zamanto mai karfi sannan kuma ya zamanto akwai tunani a cikinsa don mu sami damar isa ga wannan matsayi na farko.	it is necessary that this effort becomes strong and also becomes there is thought in it for us to have the opportunity to reach this first level.
1054	Becoming the top country in the region is not just a whim. No, we want to become the top country because the destiny of our nation depends on it.	Wannan batu na isa ga matsayi na farko ba wai wani yayi ne ba na cewa mu din nan za mu kai ga matsayi na farko ba; a'a, saboda cewa makomar al'ummomi a yau ta dogara ne da wannan lamarin.	this issue has not reached a first-class level, not because someone did it, but i'm saying we here will not take it to a first-class level; no, because today's general conditions depend on this issue.
1055	If a country fails to fulfill its needs and make progress in the area of economy, knowledge and infrastructure that are necessary for progress, it will be oppressed in a merciless way.	Idan har wata kasa a fagen tattalin arziki, a bangaren ilimi, a bangaren abubuwan ci gaban kasa ba ta iya tabbatar da abin da take bukata da kuma samun ci gaba ba, to kuwa cikin rashin tausayi za a ci gaba da zaluntarta.	if a country in the economic sector, in the educational sector, in the area of national development cannot guarantee what it needs and also make progress, then it will continue to be oppressed due to lack of compassion.
1056	We do not want to be oppressed.	Mu dai ba ma son a zalunce mu.	we really don't want to be oppressed.
1057	Our country has been subjected to oppression and transgression for two hundred years.	Shekaru dari biyu kenan kasar mu take fuskantar cutarwa da zalunci.	our country has been facing disease and oppression for two years.
1058	This oppression was the result of the weakness of incompetent, corrupt and materialistic monarchies and the dynamism that their enemies enjoyed.	Raunin hukumar sarakuna maras dacewa mai son duniya da kuma irin makircin da makiya suke aikatawa shi ne dalilin faruwar wannan zaluncin.	the failure of the government authorities that are not suitable for the world and the kind of oppression that women are subjected to is the reason for this crisis.
1059	The English first infiltrated and interfered in the political system of our country in the year 1800. They recruited supporters for themselves. And certain other European countries accompanied them and did the same things.	Tun daga shekarar 1800 ne a karon farko turawa Ingila suka kutso cikin cibiyoyin siyasa na kasar nan da tsoma bakinsu, haka su din nan da na kurkusa da su na daga sauran kasashen turai suka ci gaba da hakan na tsawon wancan lokacin.	since the 1800s, the british colonizers first began to interfere in the political affairs of this country with their influence, and they and other european countries continued to do so for a long period of time.
1060	In the year 1800 when the first English ambassador entered our country, he started to bribe people and buy supporters as soon as he got off the ship in the city of Bushehr. The ambassador was coming from India. It was when the English had the Indian government under control.	Shekarar 1800 ne jakadan Ingila na farko ya shigo kasar nan - wanda ya zo ne daga Indiya; wato a wancan lokacin da hukumar Indiya take hannun turawan Ingila sannan kuma cibiyar sarauta tana can ne - daga wannan garin na Bushehr lokacin da ya sauka daga jirgin ruwa, ya fara ba da cin hanci da sayen mutane, cikin sauki kuwa ya sami damar sayen wasu mutanen.	in the year 1800, the first english ambassador entered this country - who came from india; that is, at a time when india was under british rule and the royal palace was there - from this city of bushehr when he disembarked from the ship, he began to give out alms and buy people, and easily he got the opportunity to buy some people.
1061	All those princes, emirs and other people with such impressive-sounding titles gave in to the presents of the ambassador. The process of oppression by the enemies started from that day. Our weak statesmen let the enemy infiltrate the country on that day.	Dukkanin wadannan ‘ya'yan sarki da sarakuna da sauransu, nan da nan suka mika kai ga wannan mutumin. Makircin makiya da kafar ungulunsu daga nan ya faro a wannan kasar. Wadannan sarakuna na wancan lokaci marasa lamiri sun bar makiya suka sami bakin magana da kutsawa cikin wannan kasar.	all these royal children and kings and the rest, one by one, they presented this man. the oppression of women and their marginalization from there began in this country. these kings of that time without shame left women to find their voice and respect in this country.
1062	We do not want this process to continue.	To mu dai ba ma son hakan ta ci gaba da wanzuwa.	we really don't want this to continue happening.
1063	The Revolution has presented them with an insurmountable obstacle.	Juyin juya halin Musulunci ya samar da wata garkuwa ta karfe a gabansu.	the rotation of the islamic situation has created a crisis at their forefront.
1064	We want to strengthen this obstacle.	Muna son wannan garkuwar ta kara karfi ne.	we love that this fence has become stronger.
1065	We must not at all allow them to interfere in our economy, culture, politics and destiny.	Bai kamata mu bar su ta kowace hanya su zamanto masu tsoma baki cikin tattalin arzikinmu, cikin al'adunmu, cikin siyasar mu da kuma makomarmu da albarkatun kasar mu ba.	we should not let them go their own way, they will become a thorn in our economic, cultural, political and our homes and blessings of our country.
1066	Economy is one of the important pillars of this domestic strength.	Daya daga cikin tushen wannan karfi na cikin gida shi ne tattalin arziki.	one of the advantages of this strength at home is economic stability.
1067	This is why we say we must become the top country in the region.	Wannan shi ne dalilin da ya sa muke cewa wajbi ne mu zamanto a matsayi na farko.	this is the reason why we say it is mandatory for us to be in the first position.
1068	It is not just a whim. No, the destiny of our nation depends on it.	Ba wai cewa wani yayi ne na cewa dole ne Iran ta zamanto ta farko a wannan yankin ba; a'a saboda makomar wannan al'umma ta ta'allaka ne da hakan.	it is not that someone said iran must become the first in this region; no, because the destiny of this nation is tied to it.
1069	Therefore, persistent, clever, sincere and effective efforts - which utilize all capacities of the country - play a role in this regard.	A saboda haka wajibi ne a dinga gudanar da ayyuka da kuma kokari ba kama hannun yaro cikin tsarkin zuciya da kuma yin tasiri, wanda wajibi ne a yi amfani da dukkanin karfi da fagagen da ake da su a wannan kasar.	therefore, it is necessary to carry out tasks and efforts not like a child with a faint heart, but with influence, which is necessary to use all the strength and resources available in this country.
1070	This was what I had heard and I saw it for myself after the Revolution and the resultant advances in the country.	Mun ji hakan; sannan kuma muna ganin hakan cikin irin ci gaban da kasar nan ta samu a lokacin juyin juya halin Musulunci.	we felt this; then we also saw this in the kind of progress that this country has made at the time of the reversal of the state of islam.
1071	Before the Revolution, nobody would have believed the progress that has been made in the country in the area of building dams.	Abin da ya faru a fagen madatsan ruwa a kasar nan, kafin nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci babu wani da zai yarda cewa hakan za ta faru.	what happened in the water crisis in this country, before the success of changing the situation of islam, no one would agree that this would happen.
1072	The gentleman who spoke in this meeting referred to building dams as an example, but the same is true of many other areas. There was a day when it was impossible to convince people that such scientific progress would be made in the country. Today we can see these advances in front of our eyes.	An kafa misali ne da madatsan ruwa amma a bangarori daban-daban ma haka lamarin ya ke. Abubuwan da a halin yanzu suke faruwa na irin ci gaban da ake samu a kasar nan, a wani lokaci a baya (ko shakka babu) babu wani da ya yarda cewa za su faru, to amma a yau ga shi nan muna ganinsu suna faruwa a gaban idanuwanmu.	an example has been set with the boiling water, but in various circumstances it is the same. the things that are happening now are like the progress we see in this country, sometimes in the past (no doubt) no one agreed that they would happen, but today we see them happening right before our eyes.
1073	I have realized through experience that there is nothing that our youth are incapable of doing when the necessary infrastructure has been prepared. Any thing for which the necessary infrastructure has been prepared can be done by our youth. We enjoy such human resources in the country.	Ina fadin hakan ne sakamakon irin masaniyar da nake da ita dangane da bangarori daban daban na kasar nan, ta yadda babu wani bangare a kasar nan da matasanmu ba za su iya bayyanar da kansu a wajen da kuma ciyar da shi gaba ba matukar dai an share musu fage.	i am saying this because of the kind of expertise i have regarding various sectors in this country, such that there is no sector in this country that our youth will not be able to represent themselves and also push it forward unless they are deliberately silenced.
1074	This is a very important point.	Wannan lamari ne mai muhimmanci.	this is an important issue.
1075	Our economic potential is also very important.	Irin karfi na tattalin arziki da mu ke da shi ma lamari ne mai muhimmanci.	the kind of economic strength we have is an important issue.
1076	Once I said that considering the proportion of our population to the population of the world, we enjoy a disproportionately large number of vital mines and natural resources.	A wani lokaci a baya na taba fadin cewa idan aka kwatanta yanayin albarkatun kasar da mu ke da su da irin yawan al'ummar mu da kuma al'ummar duniya, za a ga cewa sun dara hakan.	at some point in the past, i remember saying that if we compare the state of our country's blessings with our population and the world's population, we will see that they have increased.
1077	Similarly the area of our country is around one percent of the total land area of our planet. Well, we should have one percent of the total essential natural resources, but in certain cases we have 3, 4 or 5 percent of the total resources.	Yawan mutanen kasar nan kimanin kashi daya cikin dari na mutanen duniya ne, kamar yadda fadin kasar mu kimanin kashi daya cikin dari na dukknain fadin duniya ne - to a saboda haka abin da ya zama wajibi shi ne mu sami kashi daya cikin dari na albarkatun kasa na duniya; to amma a wasu wajajen ma abin da muke da shi din ya kai kashi 3, kashi 4 da kashi 5.	the population of this country is approximately one tenth of the world's population, just as our country's land area is about one tenth of the total world's land area - so it is therefore necessary for us to get one tenth of the world's blessings; but in some areas what we have reached is 3, 4 and 5 times.
1078	These are important capacities and they are very valuable.	Wadannan wasu fagage ne masu muhimmanci sannan kuma lamurra ne masu kimar gaske.	these are some important issues and also real challenges.
1079	The shortage of water in the country that has been rightly pointed out can be fully addressed with clever scientific and technological plans. Some of the friends who spoke in this meeting mentioned this point and I have made the same point previously. With a little care and progress, we can compensate for the shortcoming that we are suffering from.	Shi kansa wannan lamari na karancin ruwan da yanzu ake maganarsa a kasar nan kuma haka lamarin yake - mu dai kasa ce da take da karancin ruwa - to amma ana iya magance wannan matsalar ta hanyar gabatar da tsare-tsare na ilimi da suka dace, wanda wasu daga cikin ‘yan'uwa ma sun yi ishara da hakan a nan, a baya ma dai na fadi hakan. Ta hanyar gudanar da ‘yan wasu ayyuka, muna iya cike gurbin irin wadannan rashi da muke da su.	he himself, this issue of water scarcity that is now being discussed in this country and that's how the issue is - we are a country with water scarcity - but this problem can be solved by presenting appropriate scientific solutions, which some of our people have pointed out here, i have said this before. by carrying out some activities, we can fill the gap of these challenges we are facing.
1080	Therefore, our country has genuinely extraordinary capacities in terms of natural resources.	A saboda haka a hakikanin gaskiya kasar nan tana da albarkatun kasa masu yawan gaske.	therefore, in truth, this country is blessed with abundant natural resources.
1081	The same is true of our geographical position.	Haka lamarin ya ke a bangaren wajen da muke da kuma wannan yankin.	that's how the situation is in the area where we are and also this region.
1082	We are connected to two different seas.	Muna wani waje ne mai muhimmancin gaske.	we are in a place of great importance.
1083	We are connected to international waters and the sensitive region that lies between the east and the west - namely, Asia and Europe. We are located in one of the most important spots of this sensitive region. The two seas provide us access to the west and the east.	Makwabtakar da muke da ita da tekuna guda biyu da kuma alaka da yanki mai tsananin muhimmanci tsakanin gabashi da yammaci, wato tsakanin Asiya da Turai, muna wani bangare ne mai muhimmanci na wannan yankin, hakan ya samar mana da damar haduwa da yammaci da kuma gabashi.	our location, with its two ports and its strategic geographical location between the east and the west, that is, between asia and europe, gives us a significant role in this region, allowing us to interact with both the east and the west.
1084	These are all advantages that we enjoy.	Dukkanin wadannan wasu abubuwa ne masu kyau a gare mu.	all of these things are good for us.
1085	As was mentioned, one fourth of the time for the 20-Year Strategic Plan has passed.	A halin yanzu dai - kamar yadda aka yi ishara da hakan - mun ci kashi daya cikin hudu cikin shekarun shirin ci gaban kasa na shekaru ashirin da aka tsara.	as of now - as indicated - we have consumed one quarter of the twenty-year national development plan.
1086	One four-year plan - namely, the fourth development plan - is over. This year is the first year of the fifth development plan.	Wato wani shiri na shekaru hudu da aka tsara ya riga da ya kare; shekarar bana mafari ne na shiri na biyar.	that means a four-year plan has been set and completed; the first year is the fifth plan year.
1087	Of course many things were done during the fourth development plan.	Tabbas an gudanar da ayyuka masu yawa a cikin shiri na shekaru hudun.	indeed, many activities have been carried out in the course of ten years.
1088	According to the accurate reports that were presented in this meeting, very important things have been done. But there are certain other things that have not been done yet.	Kamar yadda rahoton da suka gabatar wanda kuma kun saurare shi kuma haka lamarin ya ke an gudanar da ayyuka masu muhimmancin gaske; to amma duk da haka akwai wadansu ayyukan da ba a gudanar da su ba wadanda kuma wajibi ne a yi su.	as the reports presented and you have heard, this is how the important tasks are being carried out; however, there are some tasks that have not been carried out, which are necessary to do.
1089	The policies that have been announced regarding reforming the norms of consumption, the general policies of our bureaucratic system, the general employment policies and the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution - all these policies are in harmony.	Siyasar da aka sanar a fagen gyara irin yadda ake amfani da albarkatun kasa, siyasa ta gaba daya ta tsarin nan, siyasa ta gaba daya ta samar da aikin yi da kuma siyasar doka ta 44 - wadanda aka sanar da su - dukkaninsu tsare-tsare ne da suka yi daidai da junansu.	the politics announced in the reform section on how to use the country's resources, the politics has consistently followed this system, the politics has consistently provided jobs and also the 44th law politics - which were announced - all of them are individual and they have done justice to their people.
1090	If we manage to formulate and implement the plan on the basis of these policies, we will manage to make far better use of the capacities that I spoke about.	Idan har muka iya gudanar da wadannan tsare-tsare kamar yadda aka tsara, to kuwa za mu iya amfanuwa da irin wadannan dama da albarkatu da ake da su wadanda aka yi ishara da su.	if we can carry out these precautions as planned, then we can benefit from these blessings and opportunities that they indicate.
1091	These policies create a kind of cohesion and this cohesion between different layers ensures economic dynamism.	Wadannan siyasa za su iya samar da wani hadin kai da kuma tabbatar da yunkuri na tattalin arziki.	these policies can create a bridge and ensure the persistence of economic growth.
1092	Of course some of the goals that had been specified in the fourth development plan were not achieved. Many factors were involved: both domestic and international issues were involved.	Ko da yake ba a cimma wadansu daga cikin manufofin da aka tsara su cikin tsari na shekaru hudun ba, akwai dalilai daban-daban da suka hana cimma hakan; da suka hada da lamurra na cikin gida da kuma wasu na waje.	even though some of the goals set in the plan of years ago have not been achieved, there are various reasons that have prevented this from happening; which include issues at home and some abroad.
1093	Among the goals that have not been achieved are the 8 percent growth, reducing unemployment, the percentage of investment that had been specified and the issue of reducing inflation which I spoke about previously.	Batutuwa irin su samun ci gaba na kashi 8 cikin dari, ko kuma rage rashin aikin yi ko kuma kashin da aka tsara na zuba jari ko kuma lamarin rage irin tsadar kayayyaki - wanda a wancan ranar na yi ishara da hakan - dukkanin wadannan abubuwa ne da ba a cimma su ba.	such challenges as getting an 8 out of 10 score, or reducing unemployment, or the inflation rate that was set, or the issue of reducing the level of goods - which i pointed out that day - all these things have not been achieved.
1094	We need to intensify our labor so that we can compensate for the past shortcomings.	Hakan lamari ne da ke wajabta mana kara kokarin a cikin wannan shiri na shekaru biyar don mu sami damar cike irin gibin da ake da su a baya.	this is an obligation that requires us to make more efforts in this five-year project so that we can have the opportunity to fill the kind of gap that existed in the past.
1095	According to Article 44 of the Constitution, we had to limit the ownership and economic activities of the government and we did so. What was the goal?	A bisa abin da aka fadi cikin wannan dokar, wajibi ne mu sake nazari a fagen mallaka ta gwamnati da ayyukan tattalin arziki na gwamnati, an gudanar da hakan.	based on what was said in this policy, it is necessary for us to reconsider the issue of government control and government economic activities, this has been implemented.
1096	The goal was to create a competitive economy with the presence of the private sector and its investments in the economy of the country.	Da wata manufa? Da manufar samar da wani tattalin arziki da ke cike da gasa ta hanyar shigo da ‘yan kasuwa da masu zuba jari a fagen tattalin arziki.	with what advantage? the advantage of providing a vibrant economy filled with activity through the influx of market-goers and investors in the economic sector.
1097	According to calculations, the amount of money that is required for investment over this five-year period is around 160 billion dollars.	Sun yi lissafi sun gano cewa kudaden da ake bukata wajen zuba jari cikin wadannan shekaru biyar din, a kowace shekara ya kai kimani dala biliyan 160.	they did an audit and found that the amount needed to invest in these five years, each year reached up to 160 billion dollars.
1098	And this is something that must be done.	Wajibi ne a samar da hakan.	it is necessary to provide this.
1099	Good things have been done regarding the implementation of the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution, but what has been done so far is not enough. It is necessary to improve our performance. It is not just a matter of privatizing economic enterprises and leaving the arena.	A fagen gudanar da siyasar doka ta 44 an gudanar da ayyuka masu kyau to amma dai ba su wadatar ba; wajibi ne a kara kaimi. Lamarin ba shi ne kawai mu mika cibiyoyin tattalin arziki shi kenan mu ce mun mika musu ba, shi kenan mu huta; baya ga wannan mikawar akwai kuma wadansu ayyukan da ya wajaba a aikata: wajibi ne a karfafa bangaren ‘yan kasuwan, wajibi ne a samar da jagoranci mai kyau sannan da kuma a sanya ido wajen ganin ba a yi mummunan amfani da hakan ba.	in the conduct of the 44th police policy, good tasks were carried out but they were not sufficient; it is necessary to do more. the issue is not just about us distributing economic resources, it's about us resting; beyond this distribution, there are also some tasks that need to be done: it is necessary to strengthen the market sector, it is necessary to provide good leadership and also to pay attention to ensure that there is no misuse of it.
1100	Healthy activities are always accompanied by unhealthy activities.	A ko da yaushe a tattare da ayyuka masu kyau, akwai wadansu ayyukan kuma marasa kyau.	there is always a mix of good and bad deeds, some deeds are not good.
1101	I have been stressing the issue of economic corruption for several years.	Shekara da shekaru kenan na ke ta magana kan batun fada da masu ta'annuti ga tattalin arziki.	for years and years, i have been talking about the issue of corruption and its impact on the economy.
1102	When I first pointed out the issue, a number of people came to me and said that because I was stressing the issue of economic corruption, our investors might be frightened to enter economic activities.	A lokacin da na gabatar da wannan lamarin, wadansu su kan zo wajena su ce wadannan maganganu da kake yawan yi kan batun ta'annuti ga tattalin arziki zai tsoratar da ‘yan kasuwa wajen shigowa fagen tattalin arziki.	at the time i presented this issue, some would come to me and say these frequent talks you make about corruption in the economy will scare off traders from entering the economic sector.
1103	I told them that my comments would have the opposite effect and that investors would be encouraged to engage in economic activities.	Ni dai na ce musu sabanin (abin da kuke fadin), hakan lamari ne da zai kwadaitar da su shigowa.	i simply told them the truth (about what you're saying), this is a matter that will prevent them from entering.
1104	If an investor who wants to engage in a lawful and honorable business knows that the government will prosecute those who violate the law, he will be encouraged more.	Duk wani dan kasuwan da yake son samun abinci na halal sannan kuma yake son gudanar da ayyuka na halal wadanda shari'a ta amince da su, idan ya fahimci cewa gwamnati ba za ta yi sassauci ga masu karya doka ba, hakan lamari ne da zai karfafa masa gwuiwa.	every market trader who wants to get halal food and also wants to carry out halal activities that are approved by sharia, if he understands that the government will not be lenient with lawbreakers, this is a matter that will strengthen his fear.
1105	We are opposed to those who give rise to corruption and those who abuse their position. An investor who helps the country through his presence, his ideas, his money, his investments and his entrepreneurial activities, should be encouraged and praised. Therefore, fighting economic corruption is an essential principle in this regard and it is necessary to observe this principle.	Mu dai muna adawa da masu satan kudaden gwamnati ne, haka nan kuma da masu samar da hanyoyin yin hakan, haka nan ma ga masu mummunan amfani da damar da suka samu. Wajibi ne a karfafa gwuiwan dan kasuwan da yake taimaka wa kasar nan da tunaninsa, da dukiyarsa, da jarin da ya zuba da kuma ayyukan da yake gudanarwa. A saboda haka fada da ta'annuti ga tattalin arziki, ko shakka babu wani rukuni ne na asasi da wajibi ne a aiwatar da shi.	we are indeed in conflict with those who misuse government funds, as well as those who create means of doing so, and even those who maliciously benefit from the opportunities they get. it is necessary to strengthen the economy of the common man who helps the country with his thoughts, his wealth, the sweat he pours, and the tasks he performs. therefore, speaking truth to power is essential for economic growth, there is no doubt that it is a fundamental pillar and a duty to implement it.
1106	Fortunately all or most of our ministers and government officials in charge of economic activities are present in this meeting.	Abin farin cikin shi ne cewa dukkanin ko kuma mafi yawa daga cikin ministocin tattalin arziki da jami'an gwamnati na bangarorin tattalin arziki suna nan a wannan wajen.	his joy is that all or most of the economic ministers and government officials are here at this point.
1107	Well, you heard the comments of those who spoke in this meeting: both the comments about your strengths and the suggestions which were indicative of the existence of certain shortcomings. I hereby ask our government officials to carefully think about the comments they heard today.	To sun ji abubuwan da wadanda suka yi magana suka fadi; wato shin bangarorin da suka yi magana kan ababe masu kyau da aka aikata ne ko kuma irin shawarwarin da suka fadi wadanda suke nuni da irin nakasin da ake da su. Ina kiranku da ku sanya ido sosai kan abubuwan da kuka ji, sannan kuma ku yi tunani da nazari kansu.	they heard the things about which they spoke; that is, whether the discussions they had about good things were done or the advice they gave, which indicated the kind of displeasure they had. i am calling on you to pay close attention to what you heard, and then think and reflect on them.
1108	We must not let comments be made and then do nothing.	Kada mu bari abubuwan da aka fadin su kare a nan.	let's not let the things that were said here be forgotten.
1109	Mr. Tavakkoli complained that you did not mention the negative points. I would disagree with him because when you suggest that a certain thing should be done, it means that it has not been done yet and this shows that there are certain shortcomings and problems.	Na'am duk da cewa Malam Tawakkuli ya yi kukan cewa me ya sa ba a fadin abubuwa marasa kyau da ake da su; me ya sa (an fadi mana) a lokacin da aka gabatar da shawarwarin cewa wajibi ne a gudanar da kaza, hakan yana nufin cewa ba a gudanar da shi ba ne; wanda hakan yana nuni ne da wasu daga cikin nakasi da matsalolin da ake da su ne.	yes, despite malam tawakkuli's lamentation about why there are bad things happening; why was it said at the time of suggesting that it is necessary to run a chicken, this means that it is not run; which indicates that some of the problems and difficulties they are facing.
1110	He should only pay careful attention to the suggestions which were made in this meeting and I believe they were good suggestions that deserve investigation. There are many things that remain to be said in this regard. I will only make a few recommendations.	Idan har aka lura da wadannan shawararwari, lalle a ra'ayina wadannan shawarwari ne masu kyau wadanda za a iya yin nazari da tuntuni kansu. Akwai abubuwan fadi da yawa a wannan bangaren, zan yi ishara ne da wadansu abubuwa guda biyu zuwa uku; daya daga cikin su kira ne ga cibiyoyin gwamnati da abin ya shafa, daya bangaren kuma na gaba daya ne.	if these recommendations are carefully considered, in my opinion, these are good recommendations that can be critically and immediately considered. there are many things to say in this regard, i will point out two to three things; one of them is a call to government agencies and the affected, one aspect is also a priority.
1111	The first recommendation is about full implementation of the policies that have been formulated to support the production sector. Production is the basis of economy.	Na farko, batun gudanar da siyasar taimakawa bangaren da ke samar da kayayyakin da ake bukata ne. Samar da kayayyaki shi ne asasin tattalin arziki; tushen tattalin arziki na kasa ne.	firstly, the issue of running the political sector that provides the necessary materials is important. providing materials is the basis of the economy; the economy is the backbone of the country.
1112	Production is the main pillar of our economy. Regarding the subsidy redistribution plan and the enormous efforts that the government is making in this area, attention should be paid to supporting the production sector, just as it has been pointed out in the law - namely, the 30 percent that has been specified.	Dangane da batun manufantar da irin rangwamin da gwamnati ta ke bayarwa cikin kayayyakin bukatu na yau da kullum da kuma ayyukan da ta faro su a wannan fagen, lalle wajibi ne a lura da irin goyon bayan da za a ba wa bangaren samar da abubuwan da ake bukata; kamar yadda ya zo cikin doka: wato wannan kashi 30 cikin dari din da aka ayyana.	regarding the issue of production and the type of support the government is providing in the daily needs and activities it has started in this sector, it is indeed necessary to pay attention to the kind of support that will be given to the provision and needs sector; as it comes in the law: that is this section 30 out of the identified sections.
1113	Of course some government officials who spoke with me believe that this 30 percent is not really needed.	Ko da yake wasu daga cikin jami'an gwamnati da muka yi magana da su, sun yi amanna da cewa babu bukatar wannan kashi 30 cikin darin.	even though some of the government officials we spoke with assured us that there is no need for this 30 percent in the budget.
1114	Certain sectors may not need government support, but in any case production requires support from the government. The production sector should receive its share of support.	Mai yiyuwa ne lamarin ya zamanto haka a wasu bangarorin, to amma dai ala kulli hal bangaren samar da kayyaki yana bukatar goyon bayan cibiyoyin gwamnati.	the issue has become so in some sectors, but overall, every sector in charge of providing services requires the support of government agencies.
1115	We have certain enterprises that are directly or indirectly hurt by these sanctions and it is necessary to take this point into consideration.	Akwai bangarorin da ko dai kai tsaye ko kuma ta wata hanyar wannan takunkumi ya cutar da su, don haka wajibi ne mu amfana da hakan.	there are dangers that either standing still or going in a certain direction with this machine can harm them, so it is necessary for us to benefit from this.
1116	Of course the private sector has certain obligations to fulfill in this regard: economizing on energy consumption, increasing productivity and using new machinery.	To amma tabbas bangaren ‘yan kasuwan ma yana da wani nauyi a wuyansa a wannan bangaren: (da suka hada da) tsumulmula wajen amfani da makamashi, kara matsayin amfani da kuma sabunta injunan da ake da su.	however, the market sector certainly has its weight in this regard: (including) the proliferation of the use of machinery, increasing the level of use and also updating the engines they have.
1117	Certain government officials complained to me that owners of certain industries are not interested in replacing their old machinery, which produce low output and consume a lot of energy. They complained that even if these people are provided with financial assistance, they will not use it to replace their old machinery with new machinery.	Wasu daga cikin jami'an gwamnati sun kawo min kukan cewa wasu daga cikin masu kamfanonin ba su yi wani abin a zo a gani wajen sabunta irin injunan da suke da su wadanda sun tsufa kuma suna amfani da makamashi sosai; idan har aka ba su rangwamin (da gwamnati take bayarwa din), ba za su yi amfani da shi ba.	some government officials brought me the complaint that some of the companies are not doing anything to come and see the kind of engines they have, which are outdated and heavily used; if they are not given the subsidy (which the government provides), they will not use it.
1118	It is necessary to pay attention to this point.	To wajibi ne a lura da wannan lamarin.	it is necessary to pay attention to this issue.
1119	Needless to say, government supervision is very important in this regard. That is to say, the government should provide support and it should also supervise the companies that it supports.	Ko da yake sanya idon gwamnati a wannan fagen ma lamari ne mai muhimmanci; wato a gefen irin wadannan taimako da gwamnati take bayarwa, wajibi ne kuma a sanya ido.	regardless, it is important to focus government attention on this issue; especially in terms of the kind of assistance the government is providing, it is also necessary to pay attention.
1120	The production sector should be provided with as much financial assistance as has been specified in the law, but care should be taken not to allow the people I spoke about - namely, opportunistic people - to use government's financial assistance for other purposes. I have received reports that different kinds of such diversions have happened in the country.	A ba da irin rangwamin da ya kamata a bayar; to amma kuma a sanya ido a kan irin wadannan mutanen da na yi ishara da su - wato masu mummunan amfani da damar da aka ba su - wajen ganin ba su yi amfani da shi din wajen wani aikin na daban ba, wanda hakan yana faruwa kuma muna da labarin hakan bisa rahotanin da aka fitar.	they don't provide the kind of support that should be given; but also pay attention to these kind of people that i've pointed out - those who misuse and take advantage of what they've been given - to ensure they don't use it for something else, which is happening and we have the story of that based on the reports that have been released.
1121	It is necessary to deal with such things in a decisive way so that honest producers who are interested in hard work and production can fulfill their responsibilities.	Wajibi ne a fuskanci wannan lamari da dukkan karfi don masu kamfanoni na gaskiya masu tsarkin zuciya da son yin aiki su sami damar gudanar da ayyukansu.	it is necessary to scrutinize this issue with all might so that truthful companies with integrity and passion for work can have the opportunity to perform their tasks.
1122	The next point is the issue of imports which was briefly mentioned in this meeting and which I have discussed on many occasions with government officials in charge of imports.	Batu na gaba shi ne batun shigo da kayayyaki; wanda a nan ma an yi ishara da hakan, sannan kuma a lokuta da dama na sha magana da jami'ai kan wannan batu na shigo da kayayyaki.	the issue at hand is about importation of goods; which has been indicated here, and also, i often discuss with scholars about this issue of importation of goods.
1123	Of course nobody is opposed to importing, but it is necessary to regulate and to control imports.	Babu wani wanda yake adawa da shigo da kayayyaki; to amma wajibi ne a tsara yanayin shigo da kayayyakin, a sanya ido kansu.	there is no one who opposes the entry of goods; but it is necessary to regulate the condition of entry of goods, to keep an eye on them.
1124	Just because we want certain goods to be available on the market on certain occasions - for example, during Norouz - is not a good justification for increasing imports.	Mujarradin saboda kada mu bari a sami wani lokaci - a matsayin misali ranakun kusa da idi - ya zamanto an rasa wani kaya a kasuwa, ba dalili ne mai girma da zai sanya mu kara irin mizanin kayayyakin da muke shigowa da su ba.	the editorial because we should not let a moment - for example, days close to eid - become a time when we lack goods in the market, not because of a significant reason that would make us increase the type of goods we import.
1125	It is necessary to pay attention to domestic production when making decisions about imports.	Wajibi ne a lura da abubuwan da ake samarwa a cikin gida.	it is necessary to pay attention to the things that are provided in the house.
1126	Of course it is said that imports contribute to competitiveness of domestic production. It is argued that in the absence of imports, domestic producers would not pay attention to the quality or final price of their products.	Ko da yake an fadi cewa shigowa da kaya zai taimaka wa abubuwan da ake samarwa na cikin gida; idan har ba a shigo da kayayyaki daga waje ba masu samar da kayayyaki na cikin gida ba za su ba da muhimmanci ga kyaun kayayyaki da kuma farashin kayan ba; wato shigo da kaya daga waje zai tilasta musu yin hakan.	even though it is said that importing goods will help with the things produced in the house; if goods are not imported from outside, those who produce goods inside the house will not give importance to the quality and price of the goods; that is, importing goods from outside will force them to do so.
1127	I believe the logic behind this argument is not strong.	Ni dai a ra'ayina wannan ba dalili ne mai karfi ba.	in my opinion, this is not a strong reason.
1128	Regarding the issue of imports, I would like to draw special attention to the agricultural sector. I believe importing agricultural products requires a far stronger justification than is currently presented.	Dangane da lamarin shigo da kayayyaki musamman ma kan kayayyakin gona. A ra'ayina batun shigo da kayayyakin aikin gona daga waje lamari ne da ke bukatar karfaffen dalili sama da abin da a yau mutum yake gani kafin a yarda da shi.	regarding the issue of importing agricultural products, especially on farm produce. in my opinion, the issue of importing agricultural products from abroad is a matter that requires strong evidence beyond what one sees today before agreeing to it.
1129	In the agricultural sector we produce outstanding products.	A bangaren aikin gona dai muna da kayayyaki masu kyaun gaske.	in the farming sector, we have genuine and quality tools.
1130	One of the gentlemen presented a report about our produce.	Daya daga cikin malamai ya gabatar da wani rahoto kan amfanin gona na lambu (‘ya'yan itatuwa) da ake samarwa.	one of the scholars presented a report on the benefits of vegetable farming that is being produced.
1131	In the area of produce, our country is among the best in the world in terms of quality.	Kasar mu dai a wannan bangaren tana daga cikin kasashe na gaba gaba na duniya.	our country in this region is among the leading countries in the world.
1132	We should be able to increase our products.	Wajibi ne mu kara irin abubuwan da muke samarwa.	it is our duty to increase the kind of things we are providing.
1133	We should export these garden and farm products so that the world understands what is going on in Iran and we must not import the same products with far worse quality from Latin America or other places.	Mu dinga fitar da wadannan kayayyaki na gona da lambuna don duniya ta dinga ganin abubuwan da ake da su a Iran; ba wai mu dinga shigo da irin wadannan kayayyaki daga a matsayin misali kasashen Latin Amurka da nan da can wadanda kayayyaki ne da ba su kai irin wadanda muke da su a nan ba.	we are exporting these agricultural products and fruits for the world to see what iran has; not that we are importing such products from countries like latin america and here and there that have products that are not like what we have here.
1134	The next point is related to the issue of exports.	Batu na gaba shi ne batun fitar da kayayyaki zuwa waje.	the issue at hand is the issue of exporting goods abroad.
1135	Of course the government has a duty to support exports and exporters.	Tabbas gwamnati tana da nauyi a wuyanta na ta taimaka wa masu fitar da kayayyakin.	indeed, the government has the power in its hands to assist those exporting goods.
1136	As one of the gentlemen reported, fortunately there has been a very good growth in non-oil exports and we will have a faster growth in the future. We expect non-oil exports to grow appropriately so that our exports become more than our imports.	Abin farin cikin - kamar yadda daya daga cikin ‘yan'uwa ya yi ishara da hakan - shi ne cewa kayayyakin da muke fitarwa wadanda ba man fetur ba sun samu karuwa da kuma ci gaba; a nan gaba ma za su kara samun ci gaban; a nan gaba muna da fatan cewa za mu sami ci gaban da ake bukata ta yadda mizanin abubuwan da muke fitarwa da wadanda muke shigo da su za su zamanto masu amfanarwa.	the joy - as one of us indicated - is that the products we export, which are not oil-based, have increased and will continue to increase; we hope that we will achieve the required increase in the volume of the goods we export and those we import, making them beneficial.
1137	This is the point we should reach and we should be independent of oil revenues.	Kamata ya yi mu kai matsayin da za mu iya wadatuwa da kudaden shiga da ake samunsu ta hanyar man fetur.	it is necessary for us to reach a level where we can control the income we get from oil sales.
1138	Dependence on oil revenues is one of the most important economic woes of our country and it has not just plagued our economy: it has been a general problem.	Daya daga cikin manyan bala'oin da suke fuskantar bangaren tattalin arzikin mu da kuma dukkanin arzikin kasar nan na gaba daya, shi ne dogaro da kudaden shigar da ake samunsu ta hanyar man fetur.	one of the major challenges they face in our economic sector and the overall future economy of this country is trust in the funds generated through oil sales.
1139	We must reach a point where we can stop our exports due to political or economic considerations for a period of 15 days or one month if we decide to do so. I made this point several years ago, but at that time our government officials did not welcome my suggestion.	A shekarun da suka gabata na fadi - ko da ya ke a wancan lokacin jami'an gwamnatin ba su na'am da hakan ba - wajibi ne mu kai ga matsayin da idan har a wata rana saboda lamurra na siyasa da kuma tattalin arziki na duniya mu ka yanke shawarar dakatar da sayar da man fetur din mu a matsayin misali na kwanaki sha biyar ko kuma wata guda, za mu iya yin haka.	in the past years, i have said - even when the government officials did not agree with this - it is our duty to reach a level where we can decide to stop selling our oil as an example for five days or even one day, we can do that because of political and economic situations in the world.
1140	Imagine what would happen in the world.	Ku duba ku ga wani irin abu ne zai faru a duniya.	look and see, something is going to happen in the world.
1141	Today we cannot do so because we are in need of oil revenues.	A yau dai ba za mu iya yin hakan ba, saboda kuwa muna da bukatar wadannan kudaden shigan.	today, we cannot do this because we need these entrance fees.
1142	If one day our economy becomes independent of oil revenues and oil exports, the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic will manage to gain this advantage, which will have an extraordinary effect on the world.	A duk ranar da tattalin arzikin kasar nan ya wadatu daga dogaro da kudaden shiga na man fetur, to kuwa al'ummar Iran da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci a Iran za su sami wani irin karfi ta yadda tasirinsu zai zamanto mai karfin gaske a duniya.	if the economy of this country collapses from dependence on oil revenues, then the people of iran and the islamic republic system in iran will gain a kind of power so that their influence will become truly powerful in the world.
1143	This is the point we must reach. Well, this requires support. It is necessary to support exports.	Wajibi ne mu cimma hakan. To hakan dai lamari ne da ke bukatar taimako da goyon baya; wajibi ne a goya wa wannan lamari na fitar da kayayyaki waje baya.	it is our duty to achieve this. well, this is a matter that requires support and encouragement; it is necessary to promote this issue of exporting goods abroad.
1144	On the other hand, our exporters and those in charge of exports have certain duties to fulfill. Wrong actions of our exporters would show their effect in the case the countries that are the major destinations of our exports. It is bad to send low-quality products and products with unfavorable packaging and it is bad to have delays in delivery.	To a wannan bangaren ma su kansu masu fitar da kayan da kuma jami'ansu suna da wani nauyi a wuyansu. Su kansu wadannan kasashen da aka yi ishara da cewa mafi yawa daga cikin kayayyakin da muke fitarwa muna kai su wadancan kasashen ne, to muna samun labaran irin mummunan ayyukan da wasu masu fitar da kayayyakin suke yi. Aikawa da kayayyakin da ba a bukatarsu, munanan kayayyaki, jinkiri wajen aikawa da kayan, dukkanin wadannan abubuwa ne masu muni.	in this section too, they themselves who export goods and their officials have a certain weight on their shoulders. these countries that have been identified as receiving most of the goods we export, we are getting reports of terrible acts that some exporters are doing. sending goods that are not needed, these useless goods, delaying in sending goods, all these things are disturbing.
1145	Successful companies throughout the world have managed to keep their customers satisfied for 100 or 150 years.	Akwai kamfanoni a duniya wadanda tsawon shekaru dari zuwa dari da hamsin suka yi suna kera kayayyaki da kuma sayar da su ga masu saye da kuma ci gaba da samun yardarsu.	there are companies in the world that for forty to fifty years have been manufacturing and selling their products to consumers and continue to gain their trust.
1146	For example, imagine a German or Swiss company that has been selling a certain product for 150 or 160 years and it still has its customers in our country and other countries.	A matsayin misali wani kamfani na kasar Jamus ko kuma Swiss kimanin shekaru dari da hamsin zuwa dari da sittin suna kera kayayyaki da kuma sayar da su kuma har ya zuwa yanzu suna da masu sayen kayayyakinsu a kasar mu da ma sauran kasashe.	as an example, a company from france or switzerland has been manufacturing and selling their products for about fifty to sixty years and until now, they have customers in our country and other countries.
1147	Why?	Saboda me?	why?
1148	Exporters must take these points into consideration.	Wajibi ne masu fitar da kayayyaki su yi la'akari da wadannan abubuwa.	it is necessary for those who export goods to consider these things.
1149	This requires a culture, the culture of developing high-quality products that are supposed to be sent to foreign countries.	Hakan lamari ne da ke bukatar wata al'ada; al'ada da kyautata aiki cikin kayayyakin da ake samarwa don amfani na cikin gida da kuma waje.	this is a matter that requires a routine; a routine that works efficiently in the provision of utilities for use both at home and outside.
1150	The issue of fighting economic corruption is also very important.	Batun fada da ta'annuti wa tattalin arziki shi ma lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske.	the issue of corruption and economic mismanagement is indeed a very important matter.
1151	As long as there is nobody on the inside to help an outsider, that outsider cannot give rise to economic corruption.	Matukar dai wannan lalatacen mutumin bai sami wani lalataccen mutum a cikin gwamnati wanda zai taimaka masa ba, to ba zai sami damar yin ta'annuti ga tattalin arzikin ba.	indeed, this corrupt person did not find any corrupt individual within the government who would help him, so he did not get the opportunity to embezzle funds.
1152	Therefore, government officials have a responsibility to be extremely sensitive in governmental organizations to the emergence and infiltration of economic corruption.	A saboda haka jami'an gwamnati suna da wani nauyi a wuyansu wajen hana yaduwar fasadi na tattalin arziki a cikin cibiyoyin gwamnati.	therefore, government officials have a responsibility on their shoulders to prevent the recurrence of economic corruption within government institutions.
1153	For example, when you examine a sample of chickens on a chicken farm and find out that a certain disease has started in that place, you do not show mercy because you know that if you fail to take action out of consideration for that particular chicken farm, then the consequences will not be limited to a few thousand chickens.	A matsayin misali a lokacin da kuka fahimci cewa wata cuta ta kunno kai cikin gonan kaji, to babu wata rahama da tausayi da za ku nuna (wajen kawar da kajin da suka kamu da wannan cutar); saboda kun san cewa idan har kuka yi sako-sako, to kuwa cutarwa da za ta faru ba za ta takaita kawai ga wadansu dubban kaji ba ne; lamari ne da zai yadu, a saboda haka kuke daukan tsattsauran matakai.	as an example, at the time when you understand that a disease has spread among your crops, there is no mercy or compassion that you will show (in eradicating the disease that has infected this crop); because you know that if you are negligent, the disease that will occur will not only affect some crops; it is a matter that will multiply, hence you are taking drastic measures.
1154	The same is true of corruption.	To shi ma fasadi na tattalin arziki haka yake.	he too is corrupt in economic affairs.
1155	I am addressing to this point to our government officials: if you feel or see that there is a possibility for corruption in governmental organizations, you must not hesitate.	Idan har a wani waje cikin cibiyoyin gwamnati ku ka ji ko kuma kuka ga wata alama ta fasadi na tattalin arziki - a nan ina magana ne da jami'an gwamnati - to bai kamata ku yi sako-sako ba.	if you are in a government office and you hear or see a sign of economic corruption - here i am referring to government officials - then you should not keep quiet.
1156	Economic corruption is a syndrome that spreads very fast and is highly contagious. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to this point.	Cutar ta'annuti ga tattalin arziki tana daga cikin cututtuka masu hatsarin gaske da kuma yaduwa cikin sauri; a saboda haka wajibi ne a lura da hakan sosai.	the disease of poverty for economic development is among the serious diseases and also rapidly spreading; therefore, it is necessary to pay serious attention to this.
1157	Preparing a comprehensive plan for the development of the cooperative sector is one of the things that is absolutely necessary to do. The issue of our cooperative sector has been stressed in the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution.	Daya daga cikin abubuwa na wajibi shi ne tsara cikakken shiri na ciyar da bangaren hadin gwuwai gaba; wanda a cikin wannan siyasa ta 44 mun yi ishara da wannan lamari na hadin gwuiwa wanda wajibi ne a aiwatar da hakan.	one of the responsibilities is to properly plan the process of carrying forward the integration process; in this policy 44, we have indicated this issue of integration which is necessary to implement.
1158	We need a complete and comprehensive policy for the cooperative sector and this is something that must be done.	Mu na da bukatar wata siyasa cikakkiya a bangaren hadin gwuiwa.	we need a comprehensive policy in the area of cooperation.
1159	The points which were raised by one of the gentlemen about offering banking facilities to small businesses and other such issues can be taken care of through the cooperative sector.	Kamar yadda daya daga cikin ‘yan'uwa ya yi ishara da hakan ya ce ana iya amfani da irin rangwamin da bankuna suke bayar da dai sauransu, to za a iya cimma hakan ne a karkashin inuwar wannan hadin gwuiwan; wato mafi kyaun hanyar cimma hakan ita ce wannan hadin gwuiwan; hadin gwuiwa wace ta dace da hankali da kuma doka.	as one of the brethren indicated that banks can use this type of network, then this can be achieved under the umbrella of this partnership; the best way to achieve this is this partnership; a partnership that requires caution and law.
1160	This is practical. Another essential point is that we must make serious efforts to point out investment opportunities to the private sector.	Wani lamarin na asali na gaba shi ne mu ba da muhimmanci ga batun bayyanar da damar zuba jari da ake da ita a kasar nan ga bangaren ‘yan kasuwa.	an essential issue going forward is our commitment to the issue of transparency and the opportunity to invest that is available in this country for the business community.
1161	That is to say, those who are active in the private sector should know what the investment opportunities are. Everybody should be informed of the opportunities and the information should not just be available to a particular group of people.	Wato wajibi ne bangaren ‘yan kasuwa su fahimci a ina ne ake da dama na zuba jari, wajibi ne kowa ya sami labari, kada ya zamanto wadansu ne kawai za su amfana da hakan.	it means it is the responsibility of the market participants to understand where there is an opportunity to invest, it is everyone's responsibility to get the news, so that it doesn't become only a few people who will benefit from it.
1162	Those who have this information will be able to abuse it.	Wadanda suke da labari za su yi mummunan amfani da hakan.	those who have the information will greatly benefit from it.
1163	Such information should be available to everybody.	Wajibi ne bayanai su zamanto ga kowa da kowa.	it is necessary that everyone should understand my explanations.
1164	Of course this issue was pointed out in previous administrations as well and certain things have been done in the 9th and 10th administrations, but what has been done is not enough.	Wajibi ne bayyanar da komai a fili. Ko da yake a gwamnatocin da suka gabata an gabatar da hakan, a wancan gwamnatin da wannan ma an gudanar da ayyukan da yawa sai dai kuma ba su wadatar ba.	it is necessary to disclose everything in the open. even in the previous governments that have presented this, in that government where many activities have been carried out, yet they did not benefit.
1165	It is necessary to take other actions in this regard.	Wajibi ne a kara himma a wannan fagen.	it is necessary to increase effort in this phase.
1166	I have written down other points which I will not discuss because it is almost time for adhan.	To akwai wadansu abubuwan da na rubuta, to amma da ya ke lokacin salla ya gabato, zan tsallake su.	there are some things i wrote, but when it's time for prayer, i will leave them.
1167	By Allah's favor, those who love the country, the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic and those who are interested in the future of this nation will be encouraged by this meeting to have a more serious presence in the arena of economic activities.	Ina fatan insha Allahu wannan zaman zai zamanto wani lamari da zai kara sanya mutanen da suke kaunar kasar nan da wannan al'umma da wannan tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma makomar wannan al'umma za su kara kaimi da himma, su kara irin ayyukan da suke yi cikin hikima da nuna sanin ya kamata.	i hope, god willing, that this era will become a period that will further instill love for this country, this nation, this islamic republic system, and the institutions of this nation in the people, and they will continue to strive and perform their duties with wisdom and demonstrate knowledge as needed.
1168	"The slogan of ""Intensified Effort and Labor"", which I introduced last year, should be considered along with the issue of ""Economic Jihad""."	Wannan take na ‘Rubanya himma da kuma aiki tukuru' da muka gabatar da shi a shekarar da ta gabata, to wajibi ne a gan shi tare da batun kokari na karfafa tattalin arziki.	this initiative of 'boosting energy and hard work' that we presented last year, it is necessary to see it along with the discussion of efforts to boost the economy.
1169	By Allah's favor, everybody will work hard.	Muna fatan kowa zai kara himma.	we hope everyone will increase their effort.
1170	The future of the country is bright. The capacities of the country are extraordinary and unique.	Makomar wannan kasar dai makoma ce mai kyau. irin karfi da albarkatun da kasar nan take da su abubuwa ne masu yawa.	the traditions of this country are beautiful traditions indeed. the strength and blessings that this country possesses are many things.
1171	Thankfully there are many people in the country with good hearts, good determination, good and competent hands and insightful eyes.	Alhamdu lillahi akwai zukata masu kyau da imani da himma da karfi a wannan kasar.	praise be to allah, there are good, faithful, determined and strong people in this country.
1172	Our country has far too much potential to be considered a second rate country in the world.	Wannan kasar dai tana da dama mai yawa da ta fi karfin a kira ta da sunan kasa mai daraja ta biyu a duniya.	this country has a lot of advantages and is stronger, it is called the second highest ranked country in the world.
1173	Our historical background, our cultural heritage, the capabilities of our people, our natural resources - all of these things dictate this fact to us.	Tsawon tarihinmu, irin gado na al'adu da muke da su, irin karfi na mutane da albarkatun kasa dukkanin wadannan abubuwa ne da suke mana ishara da hakan.	throughout our history, the kind of heritage and customs we have, the strength of the people and the blessings of the land, all these things are what signify this to us.
1174	Leader’s Public Address in Mashhad - Khamenei.ir  The following is the full text of a public address delivered on March 21, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution at Imam Ridha's shrine in the holy city of Mashhad.	Shimfida: Abin da ke biye fassarar jawabin da Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci Ayatullah Sayyid Ali Khamene'i ya yi ne a ranar 21, Maris 2011 a lokacin ganawarsa da dubun dubatan mutane a haramin Imam Ridha (a.s) da ke birnin Mashhad a ranar farko ta sabuwar shekarar 1390 hijira shamsiyya:	speech: what follows is the interpretation of the response that the leader of the islamic revolution ayatollah sayyid ali khamene'i gave on march 21, 2011 during his meeting with thousands of people at the shrine of imam ridha (a.s) in the city of mashhad on the first day of the new year 1390 hijri shamsi:
1175	In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful	Da Sunan Allah Mai Rahama Mai Jin Kai	in the name of god, the most gracious, the most merciful.
1176	All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings upon the Holy Prophet, the most noble descendant of Adam, our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Al-Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and infallible household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.	Dukkan godiya ta tabbata ga Allah. Tsira da amincin Allah su tabbata ga shugabanmu kuma Annabinmu Abul Kasim al-Mustafa Muhammad tare da Alayensa tsarkaka kuma zababbu shiryayyu masu shiryarwa kuma ma'asumai masu girma musamman ma Wanzajjen Allah (Imam al-Mahdi) a bayan kasa.	all thanks be to allah. may the peace and blessings of allah be upon our leader and our prophet abul kasim al-mustafa muhammad and his pure and noble family, especially the guided ones, particularly the proof of allah (imam al-mahdi) on earth.
1177	I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me an opportunity to have this valuable experience again: being present at Ali ibn Musa ar-Ridha's shrine - may our souls be sacrificed for his sake and God's greetings be upon him.	Ina gode wa Allah Madaukakin Sarki da Ya sake ba ni tsawon rai da kuma dacewar fahimtar irin matsayin da wannan waje mai albarka yake da shi; wato kasancewa a hubbaren mai girma Imam Ali bn Musa al-Ridha (rayukanmu su zamanto fansa a gare shi sannan kuma amincin Allah ta tabbata a gare shi) a ranar farko ta shekara.	i am thanking allah, the magnificent king, who has again given me life and the appropriate understanding of the status that this blessed place holds; that is, being in the great love of imam ali ibn musa al-ridha (may our souls be sacrificed for him, and may allah's peace be upon him) on the first day of the year.
1178	I would like to congratulate all the dear brothers and sisters who have attended this great and impressive meeting on the auspicious occasion of Norouz and the beginning of the new year. The people who have gathered here are in fact a sample of the Iranian people.	Ina isar da sakon taya murnar wannan idi na Norouz da kuma shigowar sabuwar shekara ga dukkanin 'yan'uwa maza da mata wadanda suka taru a wannan waje da kuma wannan taro mai girman gaske; shin a wannan farfajiya ce ko kuma wadanda suke waje a wajaje daban-daban, 'yan'uwa maza da mata da suke sauraren wannan jawabi.	i am sending this message to celebrate this norouz period and the arrival of the new year to all men and women who have gathered in this place and this truly significant event; is it in this joy or those who are in different places, men and women who are listening to this response.
1179	On the first day of the year, our dear people travel to the holy shrine of Imam Ali ibn Musa ar-Ridha from nearby and distant cities and towns of the country in order benefit from the blessedness of this holy place.	Alal hakika wannan taron jama'a wani misali ne na al'ummar Iran. A wannan rana, al'ummar mu masu girma daga wajaje daban-daban na kusa da nesa duk sun taro a wannan hubbare na Abul Hasan al-Ridha (amincin Allah ya tabbata a gare shi) da kuma samun albarkan wannan waje.	indeed, this gathering of people is a representation of the iranian population. today, our large population from various regions near and far have all gathered at this shrine of abul hasan al-ridha (may allah's peace be upon him) and also receive the blessings of this place.
1180	Our dear brothers from the city of Mashhad are also present in this impressive gathering.	Akwai kuma 'yan'uwa maza da mata mutanen garin Mashhad da suke wannan wajen.	there are also male and female residents of the city of mashhad who are in this place.
1181	I extend my greetings and congratulations to all of you.	Ina mika gaisuwa ta ga kowa da kowa da kuma taya su murna.	i am extending greetings to everyone and also wishing them joy.
1182	The Iranian New Year is a valuable opportunity for all Iranian people and for all Muslims who celebrate Norouz to contribute to the Islamic movement.	Idin Nurouz na Iran ga dukkaninmu mutanen Iran da sauran musulmi na sauran kasashe da suke girmama wannan idi wata dama ce abar girmamawa da kuma amfani da ita a bangare na addini da yunkuri na Musulunci.	the nowruz festival in iran is for all of us, the people of iran and other muslims in other countries who celebrate this festival, it is indeed a symbol of respect and also used in the religious and cultural aspects of islam.
1183	This is the characteristic of Islam: all opportunities, all moments and all stages of life should be utilized to bring about perfection and spiritual and material progress for humanity. We Iranians can use this occasion to move towards what Islam has demanded from us and towards Islamic teachings and Islamic ahkaam [Islamic rules extracted from religious texts through Islamic jurisprudence].	Mahangar Musulunci ita ce cewa: a yi kokarin amfanuwa da dukkanin damar da aka samu, da dukkanin yanayi na rayuwa, wajen samun kamala ta dan'adam, saboda samun ci gaba na duniya da lahira. Mu din nan al'ummar Iran muna iya amfani da wannan dama da wannan lokaci wajen aikata ayyukan da Musulunci ya umurce mu da aikatawa, wajen tabbatar da hukumce-hukumcen Musulunci da kuma koyarwarsa.	the essence of islam is to strive to benefit from all opportunities and all aspects of life, in order to achieve human perfection, for the sake of progress in this world and the hereafter. we, the iranian nation, can take advantage of this opportunity at this time to carry out the tasks that islam has commanded us to do, to ensure the implementation and propagation of islamic laws and teachings.
1184	This is an opportunity for us to become familiar with the lofty goals of Islam.	Mu sanar da kanmu manyan manufofi na Musulunci.	we inform about our great beliefs in islam.
1185	Visiting one's relatives, paying attention to Allah the Exalted, learning good things from one another, gathering in religious and spiritual centers - these are valuable opportunities that we should benefit from.	A cikin wadannan ranaku, wata dama ce da ya kamata a yi amfani da ita wajen sada zumunci, komawa da Allah Madaukakin Sarki, sauraren maganganu masu kyau daga bakin wasu da kuma taruwa a wajaje na addini.	during these days, there is a need to use it for promoting peace, returning to allah the almighty king, listening to good words from others and also gathering in religious places.
1186	The fact is that for many years, especially during the rule of the Islamic system, the honorable people of our country have used Norouz as an opportunity to engage in spirituality and to get closer to Allah the Exalted.	Hakikanin lamarin shi ne tsawon wadannan shekaru musamman a lokacin da aka kafa hukuma ta Musulunci (a kasar Iran) al'ummar kasar mu sun yi amfani da wannan idi na Norouz wajen neman kusaci da Ubangiji Madaukakin Sarki.	the truth of the matter is that over these years, especially when the islamic government was established (in iran), our people have used this norouz tradition to seek refuge with the almighty king.
1187	If you pay attention, you will notice that during the first few hours of the new year most people gather in religious centers and holy places to pray.	Abin da ke tabbatar da hakan kuwa shi ne cewa idan kuka dubi daidai lokacin shigowar sabuwar shekarar, za ku ga cewa mafi yawan mutane suna taruwa ne a wajajen ibada, hubbarori, wajajen ziyara da masallatai sun shagaltu da addu'oi da ambaton Allah.	what confirms this is that if you look at the right time of the new year's arrival, you will see that most people are gathered in places of worship, squares, tourist places and mosques are busy with prayers and praising allah.
1188	The meaning of this significant move is that the Iranian nation uses this traditional occasion for religious purposes.	Ma'anar hakan ita ce cewa al'ummar Iran suna kokarin amfanuwa da wannan alama da kuma bukukuwa na al'ada amfanuwa ta addini.	the meaning of this is that the people of iran are trying to benefit from this symbol and also the religious benefits of traditional ceremonies.
1189	We should follow this prominent example in all affairs, and we should use Norouz to increase our knowledge, spirituality and piety and to practice Islamic ahkaam, Islamic teachings and Islamic ethics.	Yana da kyau mu yi koyi da wannan misali cikin dukkanin lamurra, sannan yana da kyau mu yi amfani da idin Norouz wajen kara irini ilimin da mu ke da shi, ababen da suke karfafa ruhi, addini da tabbatar da hukumce-hukumcen Musulunci, da kyawawan halaye na Musulunci.	it is good for us to learn from this example in all circumstances, and it is good for us to use the norouz festival to increase the knowledge we have, things that nourish the soul, religious and affirm the rules of islam, and the beautiful aspects of islam.
1190	I hope Allah the Exalted will make all of us successful in this regard.	Ina fatan Allah Madaukakin Sarki zai ba wa dukkaninmu, dukkanin al'ummar Iran dacewa cikin wannan aikin.	i hope that god, the almighty king, will grant all of us, all the people of iran, success in this endeavor.
1191	Today I will take this opportunity to speak about three issues.	A yau a yayin wannan dama da Allah Madaukakin Sarki Ya samar da ita, zan yi magana ne kan wasu batutuwa guda uku.	today, by the grace of almighty god who made it possible, i will discuss three issues.
1192	"First I will present a brief report of the year 1389: I will consider the issue from a broad perspective and explain the orientation of the Iranian nation and officials in the year 1389. Then I will speak about the new year, which starts from today. I will speak about this year's slogan - namely, ""Economic Jihad"" - and the appropriate measures that should be taken."	Batu na farko, shi ne dangane da abubuwan da aka aikata a shekarar 1389 (hijira shamsiyya) da ta kare, don mu ga a shekarar 1389 wasu abubuwa ne al'ummar Iran da kuma jami'an gwamnati suka aikata sannan kuma wasu hanyoyi suka bi. Batu na biyu dangane da wannan shekarar ce wacce ta faro a yau din nan; bisa la'akari da take da kuma sunan da aka ba wa wannan shekarar wato 'Shekarar Kokarin Bunkasa Tattalin Arziki' da kuma abubuwan da ya dace a aikata cikin shekarar.	the first point is about the events that took place in the year 1389 (solar hijri) and ended, so that we see in the year 1389 some things that the iranian public and government officials did and then some paths they followed. the second point is about this year which started today; considering its importance and the name given to this year which is 'year of effort to boost the economy' and the appropriate things to do within the year.
1193	In the third part of my speech I will speak about the regional issues: the issues of the Middle East, North Africa and the events that are happening in this Islamic region. I will discuss these issues in the light of the hypocrisy and plots of the enemies of the Islamic Ummah.	Batu na uku kuma, ya shafi abubuwan da suke faruwa ne a wannan yankin; lamurran yankin gabas ta tsakiya, abubuwan da ke faruwa a arewacin Afirka da kuma abubuwan da ke faruwa a wannan yanki na Musulunci, bisa la'akari da irin kokarin da makiyan al'ummar musulmi suke yi na gurbata hakikanin abin da ke faruwar.	the third chapter deals with the events happening in this region; the mysteries of the eastern region, the events in north africa and the events in this islamic region, considering the efforts that the muslim community is making to uncover the truth of what is happening.
1194	"Regarding the first issue, I can say that last year's slogan - namely, ""Intensified Effort and Labor"" - was observed throughout the year. Our people managed to make intensified efforts in different areas."	Dangane da batu na farko, lalle ina iya cewa sunan da aka ba wa shekara ta 1389 - wato 'Shekarar Rubanya Himma da Kuma Aiki Tukuru' - lalle an lura da wannan lamarin tsawon shekarar, sannan kuma al'ummar mu a bangarori daban-daban sun bayyanar da hakikanin himmar su da kuma rubanya ayyuka.	regarding the first issue, indeed i can say the name given to the year 1389 - which is 'the year of reviving will and hard work' - indeed this issue has been noticed throughout the year, and then our people in different sectors have demonstrated the reality of their will and also reviving work.
1195	Of course intensified effort and labor reveal their effects in the long term, but it is possible to see the signs of intensified effort and labor when you take a brief look at the year 1389, what the government officials did and how our dear people cooperated with their officials.	Ko da yake sakamakon wannan himma mai girma da kuma aiki tukurun za a gansu da kuma fahimtar su ne a nan gaba; to amma a irin wannan kallo na farko-farko ma cikin yanayin shekara ta 1389 da kuma irin ayyukan da jami'an kasar nan suka aikata, da kuma abubuwan da mutane tare da taimakon jami'ansu suka aikata da kuma bayyanar da shi a fili, to kuwa ana iya ganin alamar rubanya himma da kuma aiki tukuru.	regardless of the results of this great effort and hard work, they will be seen and understood in the future; but even in this first observation within the context of the year 1389 and the kind of activities that the country's agencies have carried out, and the things that people along with their agencies have done and openly declared, one can see signs of a significant increase in effort and hard work.
1196	The signs are clearly visible in many areas.	Lalle ana iya ganin hakan a fagage da yawa.	henna can be seen a lot in many places.
1197	Let us start with science and technology.	Bari mu fara daga batun ilimi da fasaha.	let's start with the issue of education and eloquence.
1198	At the beginning of the year 1389 I found the opportunity to visit an important industrial center of the country. During the last few days of the year I found another opportunity to visit a technology exhibition, and I saw the long-term results of the year-long movement with my own eyes.	A farkon shekarar 1389 - a ranakun idi - na sami damar kai ziyara daya daga cikin masana'antu masu matukar muhimmanci na kasar nan; sannan kuma a karshen watan Esfand (watan karshe na hijira Shamsiyya) na sake samun damar kai ziyara wajen baje kolin ayyuka na ilimi da fasaha inda da idanuwana na ga sakamakon wannan aiki na shekara guda.	at the beginning of the year 1389 - during the eid holidays - i had the opportunity to visit one of the most important scholars of this country; then again at the end of the month of esfand (the last month of the solar hijri calendar) i had the opportunity to visit again to discuss the culmination of my year's work in science and eloquence where i saw the results of this one year's work with my own eyes.
1199	In the area of advanced science and technology, I would tell you that what we have achieved in the country is far more than what the people know about.	Irin ci gaban da aka samu a fagen ilimi da fasaha a yau din nan a kasar nan nesa ba kusa ba ya fi abin da ake sanar da mutane cewa an cimma su; lalle zan iya bugun kirji in sanar da ku hakan.	the kind of progress made in the field of education and eloquence today in this country, far or near, surpasses what people are told has been achieved; indeed, i can swear on the bible to tell you this.
1200	A prominent scientific movement started in different areas several years ago, and fortunately this movement has gained further momentum on a daily basis.	Tun shekarun da suka gabata aka fara wannan gagarumin yunkuri na ilimi a fagage daban-daban, wanda abin farin cikin shi ne cewa a kowace rana sai dada ci gaba ake yi.	since the years that have passed, this small attempt at education has been started in various places, and the joy in it is that every day progress is being made.
1201	"Once I quoted an infallible Imam (a.s.), saying, ""Knowledge is grandeur."" It means that knowledge is a source of power for nations and individuals."	A wani lokaci a baya na taba karanto wata ruwaya da aka ruwaito ta daga wajen wani Ma'asumi (amincin Allah ya tabbata a gare shi) da ke cewa: 'Ilimi mulki ne', wato ilimi da masaniya lamari ne da zai samar da karfi ga wata al'umma da kuma wani mutum.	once upon a time, i read a story written by a certain innocent person (may god's peace be upon him) who said: 'knowledge is power', meaning that knowledge and expertise are the things that will provide strength to a community and an individual.
1202	This is a characteristic of knowledge and technology.	To ilimi da fasaha suna da irin wannan siffar.	education and eloquence have this kind of impact.
1203	Today the country is clearly moving towards obtaining knowledge in many areas, especially in newly-established and highly advanced fields.	A yau yunkurin wannan kasar a fagen neman ilimi da fasaha a mafi yawan fagage musamman a cikin sabbin fagage lamari ne da ake ganinsa a fili.	today, the effort in this country in the pursuit of education and eloquence in most languages, especially in new languages, is a visible issue.
1204	Fortunately one can see that our scientists and youth are making accelerated progress in different areas - in biotechnology, in aerospace technology, in nanotechnology, in stem cell research, in producing crucial radiopharmaceuticals, in producing antineoplastic drugs, in producing wind turbines which decrease the country's dependence on oil to a large extent, in building supercomputers which are extremely important for the country, in technologies related to new sources of energy. All of these achievements require advanced knowledge.	A bangarori daban-daban; a fagen ilimin yanayi, a fagen ilmin sararin samaniya, a fagen fasahar Nano, a fagen 'ya'yan halittu, a fagen kera na'urorin masu hangen nesa daban-daban masu muhimmanci, a fagen samar da magungunan cutar kansa, a fagen kera nau'ororin da suke taimakawa wajen rage irin dogaro da ake yi da man fetur, wajen kera na'urori masu muhimmanci ga kasar nan, a fagen fasahar makamashi -wadanda dukkanin wadannan fagagen an samu ci gaba a cikinsu - abin farin cikin shi ne cewa mutum yana iya ganin irin kokari ba kama hannun yaro da masananmu da masananmu matasa suke yi.	different innovations; in the field of weather science, in the field of nanotechnology, in the field of soil science, in the field of making different types of important remote sensing devices, in the field of creating lung disease drugs, in the field of making devices that help reduce the kind of pollution we do with fossil fuels, in making important devices for this country, in the field of quantum physics - all these fields have seen progress in them - the joy in it is that a person can see the kind of effort not equal to child's play that our scholars and young scholars are making.
1205	As I said last night in my New Year address, the reports prepared by prestigious international centers show that in this area our country is moving forward faster than many countries in the world. These reports show that the pace of our progress is several times more than the average rate of progress in the world.	Kamar yadda na fadi cikin sakon idin Nurouz a daren jiya cewa cibiyoyin bincike daban-daban na duniya sun bayyana cewar a wannan fagen kan kasar ku tana gaban mafi yawa daga cikin kasashen duniya, sannan kuma irin ci gaban da ake samu a kasar nan ya rubanya irin ci gaba na tsaka-tsaki na duniya.	as i mentioned in the nowruz message last night, various research institutions around the world have shown that your country is ahead of most countries in the world, and the progress made in this country has led to global progress.
1206	There are 2, 3 important points about scientific and technological progress which I would like to discuss now.	Akwai wadansu batutuwa guda biyu zuwa uku masu muhimmanci da suke cikin wannan lamari na ci gaban ilimi da fasaha wanda ni ina ganin ya dace in yi bayani kansu.	there are two or three important issues involved in this matter of advancing education and eloquence which i think it is appropriate to explain.
1207	The first point is that most of the scientists who are doing these things are young.	Batu na farko shi ne cewa mafi yawa daga cikin masanan da suke gudanar da ayyukansu a wannan fagen, matasa ne.	the first point is that most of the experts who carry out their activities in this field are young people.
1208	The average age of the scientists who are involved in these endeavors is 35. That is to say, they are mostly young, and it is necessary to trust these youth. Of course there are also experienced and faithful professors who are involved in these scientific endeavors, and this is very valuable.	Shekarun wadannan masana dai shi ne shekaru talatin zuwa talatin da biyar - wato mafi yawansu matasa ne - wanda wajibi ne a dogara da wadannan matasan. Tabbas akwai tsoffin masana masu imani da suke gudanar da ayyukansu a wannan fagen, wanda kuma wajibi ne a yi kokarin amfanuwa da hakan.	the age of these scholars is indeed thirty to thirty-five years - most of them are young - who must rely on these young people. certainly, there are older scholars who believe and carry out their work at this stage, which is also necessary to try to benefit from.
1209	The next point is that those who do these impressive things have a lot of self-confidence, and this self-confidence is the main asset.	Batu na gaba shi ne cewa mutanen da suke gudanar da wadannan ayyuka masu girma, mutane ne da suke da ruhi mai karfi, mutane ne da suka dogara da kansu; wanda hakan shi ne babban jari.	the future belongs to those who carry out these great tasks, people with strong spirits, people who rely on themselves; this is a great asset.
1210	Manpower is the main asset, and this is what our country enjoys.	Jari na asali shi ne karfi na mutane. Wannan shi ne abin da kasar mu take da shi.	the strength of people is our original wealth. this is what our country has.
1211	Our youth are making progress in this arena with high morale, and they believe that they can do anything, anything for which the country has the necessary infrastructures.	Matasan mu suna ci gaba da gudanar da wannan aiki cikin karfin gwuiwa, sannan kuma sun yarda da cewa dukkanin wadannan ayyuka wadanda tushe ne na ci gaban wannan kasar lamurra ne da za su iya gudanar da su.	our youth are continuing to carry out this work with great enthusiasm, and they have also agreed that all these tasks, which are the future of this country, are their responsibilities that they can handle.
1212	The next point regarding the issue of scientific progress is that the chain of science, technology, production and commercializing the products is in the process of being established. And this chain is very important.	Batu na gaba cikin lamarin ci gaban ilimi shi ne cewa silsilar ilimi, fasaha, samar da ilimin da ake bukata da kuma sayar da shi - wanda hakan lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske - lamari ne da a halin yanzu ake ci gaba da gina shi.	the issue at hand in the advancement of education is that the chain of education, eloquence, providing the necessary knowledge and also selling it - which is a very important issue - is an issue that is currently being continuously developed.
1213	That is to say, we produce knowledge, turn it into technology, develop products, market the products through international trade and produce wealth for the country.	Wato ana samar da ilimi sannan a mayar da shi zuwa ga wata fasaha, a samar da abin da ake bukata sannan kuma a kai wannan abin da aka samar din zuwa ga kasuwannin duniya wanda hakan zai samar wa wannan kasa da dukiya ne.	this means that education is being provided and then transformed into a certain eloquence, providing what is needed and then taking this product to the world markets, which will make this country wealthy.
1214	This is the way in which production of knowledge contributes to national wealth and addresses the needs of the people.	Hakan mayar tafarkin samar da ilimi zuwa ga dukiya ta kasa ne da kuma biyan bukatun mutane.	this contributes to the transformation of knowledge into national wealth and also meeting people's needs.
1215	Our dear people should know that all economic experts - both the experts who agree with the economic views of the current administration and the experts whose economic views are different from the views of the current administration - unanimously agree that redistributing subsidies is necessary, essential and very constructive.	Yana da kyau al'ummar mu masu girma su san cewa dukkanin masana tattalin arziki - shin wadanda mahangarsu ta tattalin arziki ta yi daidai da ta gwamnati mai ci ne, ko kuma wadanda ra'ayinsu na tattalin arziki ya saba wa mahangar gwamnatin - dukkaninsu sun yi amanna da cewa manufantar da rangwamin da gwamnatin take bayarwa lamari ne da ya zama wajibi sannan kuma mai amfani matuka.	it is good for our growing population to know that all economic experts - whether their economic perspective aligns with the government or those whose economic opinion is critical of the government - all of them agree that the manufacturing and service sectors that the government provides are essential and extremely beneficial.
1216	Entering this arena was very difficult, and the ground was not fully prepared.	Shiga cikin wannan fagen wani aiki ne mai wahalar gaske; sannan kuma fagagen aiwatar da hakan ba a riga da an samar da su ba.	entering into this phase of work is truly challenging; moreover, these phases are not readily available.
1217	Thankfully this work has already been initiated.	Alhamdu lillahi a halin yanzu dai an riga da an fara wannan aikin.	praise be to allah, at this moment, this work has already started.
1218	To be fair, the cooperation between the government and the people was excellent.	Kuma alal hakika hadin kan da ake samu tsakanin gwamnati da al'umma a cikin wannan aiki, hadin kai ne mai kyau.	and indeed, the cooperation that is found between the government and the public in this work, the cooperation is good.
1219	The people offered excellent cooperation when practicing the Subsidy Redistribution Law. The effects of this policy will gradually become clear in the future, although some of the positive effects have already revealed themselves.	Yunkurin mutane a wannan fagen yunkuri ne mai kyaun gaske. A sannu a hankali za a ga tasirin hakan; duk kuwa da cewa a halin yanzu ma an fara ganin tasirinsa mai kyau.	the effort of people in this phase is a genuine effort. gradually, the impact of this will be seen; even though currently, its positive effect has started to be noticed.
1220	The primary goal of the law is to distribute subsidies in a fair way. The government distributes subsidies among the people.	Manufa mai muhimmanci na wannan aikin, a matakin farko, ita ce raba irin rangwamin da gwamnati take bayarwa tsakanin mutane cikin adalci.	the importance of this work, firstly, is to reduce the kind of gap that the government is creating among people in fairness.
1221	This is a great leap towards establishing social justice.	Hakan wani mataki mai girma ne da aka taka, wajen tabbatar da adalci na zamantakewa.	this is a significant step that has been taken, to ensure the fairness of coexistence.
1222	Managing the consumption of the country's resources - especially water and energy resources - is the second goal.	Wata manufar kuma ta daban, ita ce gudanar da albarkatun kasa (yadda ya dace); ciki kuwa har da ruwa da makamashi.	another advantage is the management of natural resources (as appropriate); including water and vegetation.
1223	"I named the 1387 as ""The Year of Reforming the Norms of Consumption"" meaning being economical and avoiding waste."	"Shekaru biyun da suka gabata, mun sanya wa shekarar sunan ""Shekarar Gyara Yadda Ake Amfani Da Albarkatun Kasa""; tsumi da tattali da kuma nesantar almubazzaranci."	"two years ago, we named the year ""the year of improving how we use natural resources""; addressing waste and inefficiency and also promoting recycling."
1224	The Subsidy Redistribution Law is one of the ways in which we can truly reform the norms of consumption.	Wannan daya ne daga cikin hanyoyin da za mu iya gyara irin yadda mu ke amfani da albarkatun kasa yadda ya dace na hakika; wanda ya zuwa yanzu dai an ga tasirin hakan.	this is one of the ways we can improve how we use the blessings of the earth as it should be; the impact of which we have seen so far.
1225	Energy consumption has been reduced during the few months that the Subsidy Redistribution Law has been practiced, and this is beneficial to the country.	Cikin wadannan 'yan watannin da aka shafe ana aiwatar da wannan shiri na manufantar da irin rangwamin da gwamnati take bayarwar, yadda ake amfani da makamashi ya sauko kasa sosai; wanda hakan lamari ne da zai amfani kasar nan.	in these months that have passed, this program of manufacturing the type of fertilizer that the government is providing has been implemented, the way it is used has greatly benefited the country; which is an issue that will benefit this country.
1226	Wasteful use of bread and flour - which are great divine blessings and a lot of efforts go into producing them - has been reduced. Consumption has been balanced in this regard. This is among the benefits we have already obtained.	Irin yadda ake almubazzaranci da biredi da yadda ake zubar da shi da kuma lalata alkama - wanda babbar ni'ima ce ta Ubangiji sannan kuma cikin wahalhalu ake samo ta - ya ragu ainun, an sami daidaito cikin yadda ake amfani da shi.	the way bread is processed and how it is discarded and also the waste of flour - which is a great blessing from the lord and yet in difficulties it is found - is disappointing, there is balance in how it is used.
1227	Of course, by Allah's favor, there will be many other benefits in the future, and reforming the economic structure is among these benefits.	Wannan daya ne daga cikin irin alfanun da aka samu kuma da yardar Allah a nan gaba ne za a ga amfanin hakan sosai. Haka nan gyara yanayin tattalin arziki ma yana daga cikin wannan lamarin.	this is one of the types of arts that has been found and, god willing, its benefits will be greatly seen in the future. this also includes improving the state of the economy, which is part of this issue.
1228	The increase in non-oil exports was another sign of intensified effort and labor in the economic arena.	Haka nan kuma daga cikin ayyukan da suke nuni da rubanya himma a fagen tattalin arziki, shi ne kara irin kayayyakin da ake fita da su waje wadanda ba man fetur ba.	thus, among the activities that indicate determination in the economic field, is the increase in the type of goods that are exported, which are not oil-based.
1229	Unfortunately our country has depended on oil exports since decades ago.	Abin bakin cikin shi ne cewa shekaru aru-aru kenan kasafin kudin mu ya dogara ne da man fetur.	the bitter truth is that for four years our budget has depended on oil revenue.
1230	All economists who care about our country reject this policy, but we have been used to this state of affairs. It is wrong to export oil and use the money to manage the country.	Hakan kuwa abu ne wanda dukkanin masana tattalin arziki masu kishi suke yin watsi da shi; an saba da wannan hanya a wannan kasa ta mu. A tono man fetur, a sayar sannan kuma a ci gaba da gudanar da kasa da kudin da aka samu; wannan hanya ce da take cike da kuskure.	this is indeed something that all economic scientists who are angry are ignoring; this method is common in our country. we waste food, sell it and then continue to run the country with the money obtained; this is a method full of mistakes.
1231	Many years ago I said that one of my wishes is that one day we will be able to run the country without exporting even one single drop of oil.	Mu dai shekara da shekaru kenan na fadi cewa daya daga cikin fatan da nake da shi shi ne a sami wata ranar da za mu iya gudanar da wannan kasar ba tare da mun sayar da man fetur ba idan bukatar hakan ta taso.	we have been saying for years that one of my hopes is to find a day when we can run this country without having to sell fuel if the need arises.
1232	This has not happened so far. Of course it is very difficult to do this.	Tabbas ba aiki ne mai sauki ba, aiki ne mai tsanannin wahala.	indeed, it's not an easy job, it's a job full of immense difficulties.
1233	Increasing our non-oil exports helps us move closer to this goal, and this is already happening.	Kara irin kayayyakin da ake sayarwa wadanda ba man fetur ba lamari ne da zai kusata mu da manufar da muke da ita.	increase the types of goods being sold, those without petrol, is a situation that will force us to deal with the problem we have with it.
1234	A great leap was made in this regard in the year 1389.	An aiwatar da ayyuka masu girma a shekarar 1389 a wannan fagen.	major works were accomplished in the year 1389 in this field.
1235	Confronting the sanctions in an intelligent and firm manner is one of the things that shows intensified effort and labor in the economic arena.	Haka nan kuma daga cikin abubuwan da suke tabbatar da rubanya himma da kuma aiki tukuru a fagen tattalin arziki shi ne yadda gwamnati cikin hikima ta tinkari takunkumin da kasashen yammaci karkashin jagorancin Amurka da kuma biyayya ido rufe na wasu gwamnatocin Turai suka sanya wa Iran.	this is also among the things that confirm their determination and hard work in the economic field, is how the government wisely imposed sanctions on the winter countries under the leadership of america and the blind obedience of some european governments to iran.
1236	Since the beginning of year 1389 they have been trying to intensify their sanctions on Iran.	Tun daga farkon shekarar 1389 a tunaninsu sun kara irin takunkumin da suka sanya wa Iran.	since the beginning of the year 1389, they have increased the kind of pressure they put on iran.
1237	According to their calculations, the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation should have been brought to their knees in 5-6 months. This was what they thought.	Su da kansu cikin lissafin da suka yi - wanda labarin hakan yana iso mana - su da kansu suna fadin cewa wannan takunkumi kan cikin watanni biyar zuwa shida zai dunkufar da Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma al'ummar Iran; wannan shi ne zaton da suke yi.	they and their own are in the calculations they have made - which the story of this is coming to us - they and their own are saying that this crisis within five to six months will collapse the islamic republic and also the people of iran; this is their assumption.
1238	Through the sanctions they wanted to make life so difficult for the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic that the people would protest against the Islamic Republic. This was their goal.	Suna tunannin cewa ta hanyar wannan takunkumi za su sanya lamurra su zamanto masu wahalar gaske ga al'ummar Iran da kuma takura fage wa al'ummar Iran ta yadda su da kansu za su fito don nuna rashin amincewarsu da Jamhuriyar Musulunci; wannan ita ce manufarsu.	they are speculating that through this pressure, they will cause serious difficulties for the iranian people and also create a gap between the iranian people so that they will come out to show their dissatisfaction with the islamic republic; this is their plot.
1239	A clever and firm policy was adopted against these sanctions, and the sword of the enemy became blunt.	An gudanar da wani aiki cikin hikima wajen fada da wannan takunkumi ta yadda aka dushe kaifin wukar makiyan.	a task was carried out wisely in order to discuss this issue as the ant hill was covered.
1240	The enemy did not manage to achieve its goals through these sanctions.	Makiya sun gagara cimma manufarsu ta hanyar wadannan takunkumi.	the women have successfully achieved their goal through these strategies.
1241	Today westerners admit that imposing sanctions on Iran is no longer effective.	A yau su da kansu mutanen kasashen yammacin suke fadin cewa sanya wa Iran takunkumi dai ba shi da wani amfani.	today, people from western countries are saying that imposing sanctions on iran is not beneficial.
1242	Our country is an oil exporter, but we used to import huge amounts of gasoline, which is produced from oil.	Daya daga cikin matsalolin aikin mu tsawon lokaci shi ne wannan; mu din nan kasa ce mai fitar da man fetur, to amma kuma muna shigowa da mai din daga waje.	one of the problems with our work over time is this; we are a company that exports oil, but we also import oil from abroad.
1243	They said that this was the weakness of the Islamic Republic and that they would block gasoline imports.	Don haka suke fadin cewa wannan shi ne bangaren raunin Jamhuriyar Musulunci, ba za mu bari a shigo da man ba.	therefore, they are saying that this is the aspect of the suffering of the islamic republic, we will not let it be infiltrated with deceit.
1244	Thanks to their sanctions, our government officials started to think of a way to produce gasoline, and their efforts helped our country become self-sufficient in gasoline.	Sakamakon wannan takunkumi na su jami'an mu sun shiga cikin tunani; sun yi kokarinsu, sannan kuma muka zamanto ba ma bukatar shigowa da man fetur.	as a result of this research, our scientists have started thinking; they have made efforts, and then we realized that there is no need for entry and fuel.
1245	I heard similar things from some of the young scientists at the technology exhibition which I visited last month.	Wannan lamari ne da na ji shi daga bakunan wadannan matasa masana a ziyarar da na kai wajen baje kolin da aka gudanar a karshen watan Esfand.	this is an event that i heard about from some of these young scholars during my visit to the end of the esfand month lottery draw.
1246	"They told me, ""We wanted to build a machine, and we went abroad to buy the required parts, but they told us that they would not sell them to us because of the sanctions, so we realized that we had to manufacture the required parts as well."	Sun gaya min cewa muna son mu kera wannan na'urar, mun tafi waje don samo shi, sai suka ce mana ai ku kuna karkashin takunkumi ne, ba za su ba mu ba; sai muka fahimci cewa lalle wajibi ne mu samar da hakan da kanmu.	they told me that we wanted to build this machine, we went abroad to find it, then they told us that you are under surveillance, they will not give us; then we understood that it is indeed our duty to provide this for ourselves.
1247	"We came back and tried to produce those parts, and we succeeded to do so without the help of foreigners."" This is the clever approach."	Sai muka dawo gida, muka yi tunani, muka sha wahalhalu, mu ka yi kokari, har muka kera wannan na'urar ba tare da dogaro da baki 'yan kasashen waje ba.	after we returned home, we reflected, we faced challenges, we made efforts, until we created this device without relying on foreign countries.
1248	According to government reports, 1.6 million job opportunities were created in the year 1389. If this report is accurate, the number is half a million more than the expected job opportunities.	Rahoton gwamnati yana fadin cewa a shekarar 1389 an samar da guraban aiki miliyan daya da dubu dari shida; wanda idan har wannan rahoton haka yake, to kenan an samar da karin guraban aiki dubu dari biyar kenan sama da abin da aka yi tsammanin samarwa.	the government report states that in the year 1389, one million and six hundred thousand jobs were created; if this report is accurate, then it means that more than five hundred thousand jobs were created than initially expected.
1249	Good achievements have also been made in such areas as housing projects, construction of highways and road systems, and electronic services - all of which are related to the infrastructures of the country.	A fagen samar da matsuguni a karkara, a fagen samar da gidaje a birane da kuma samar da manyan hanyoyi da tituna da kuma fagen isar da sako na zamani da sauransu da sauransu - wadanda dukkanin wadannan abubuwa ayyuka ne na tushe da kuma gina kasa - lalle an aiwatar da ayyuka masu kyau.	in the field of creating tools in workshops, in the field of building houses in villages and also providing major roads and bridges and also in the field of delivering modern messages and so on and so forth - all these things are the end products of work and also nation-building - indeed good work has been accomplished.
1250	These are the economic achievements.	Wannan a bangaren tattalin arziki kenan.	this is in the economic sector.
1251	Many achievements have been made in other areas as well, but I will not discuss them for lack of time.	A sauran bangarori ma an aiwatar da ayyuka masu yawa, to da yake lokacin da muke da shi iyakantacce ne za mu wuce su kawai.	for the rest of the tasks too, many works have been carried out, so when we have time, we will just surpass them.
1252	"In any case, thankfully it is clear that the year 1389 was truly ""The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor""."	Ala kulli hal abin da ya bayyana mana a shekarar 1389 shi ne cewa alhamdu lillahi wannan shekarar, da dukkanin ma'anar kalma, shekara ce ta rubanya himma da kuma aiki tukuru.	in all circumstances, what was revealed to us in the year 1389 is that praise be to allah this year, with all the meaning of the word, is a year of renewed vigor and hard work.
1253	"Of course the year 1389 does not have any special significance in itself. This year, next year and the following years will all be ""The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor""."	Ko da yake shekarar 1389 ba ta da wata siffa da ta kebanta da ita; wannan shekarar ma, shekara mai zuwa ma, shekaru goma masu zuwa ma, (dukkaninsu) shekarar rubanya himma da kuma aiki tukuru ne.	even though the year 1389 does not have any characteristic that distinguishes it; this year, the coming year, the next ten years, (all of them) are years of renewed determination and hard work.
1254	The Iranian nation and its officials should make intensified efforts all the time so that we can achieve the position that the Iranian nation deserves.	Al'ummar Iran da kuma dukkanin jami'an gwamnati a ko wani mukami suke kuwa wajibi ne su zamanto masu gagarumar himma da kuma aiki tukuru su rubanya ayyukan da suke yi don mu sami isa ga wajen da ya dace da al'ummar Iran, insha Allahu.	the people of iran and all government institutions in any position are obliged to become highly motivated and work hard to accomplish their tasks in order to reach a position suitable for the people of iran, god willing.
1255	However, experts believe that at this point in time economic issues are more important and more urgent than all other issues of the country.	To sai dai a ra'ayin masana, a wannan lokacin batun tattalin arziki ya fi komai muhimmanci.	however, in the opinion of experts, at this time the issue of economic development is more important than anything else.
1256	If our country manages to make jihad-like efforts in economic areas and if the big leap that has been made is coupled with other leaps, this will undoubtedly produce great results for the country, for our progress and for the grandeur of the Iranian nation.	Idan har kasar mu mai girma ta samu nasarar yunkurawa a fagen tattalin arziki, to wannan gagarumin yunkuri zai hadu da wanda za a yi nan gaba, to ko shakka babu zai yi tasiri cikin kasar nan da ci gabanta da kuma daukakar al'ummar Iran.	if our great country succeeds in making progress in the economic sector, then this little effort will meet the one to be made in the future, there is no doubt it will have an impact in this country and its development and the empowerment of the iranian people.
1257	In this regard the important criterion is the accelerated economic growth which has been specified in the fifth development plan - a growth of at least 8 percent.	Abin da yake da muhimmanci a wannan fagen, shi ne samun ci gaban kasa bisa mizanin da aka tsara cikin shirin ci gaban kasa na shekaru biyar; wato alal akalla a samu ci gaba kashi takwas cikin dari.	what is important at this stage is to achieve national progress based on the scale set in the five-year national development plan; that is, to achieve at least an eight percent progress within a decade.
1258	Productivity should be a large portion of this growth.	Kaso mai girma zai shafi irin karfin da muke da shi ne wajen amfani da karfin da muke da shi a cikin kasa yadda ya dace.	a large box will affect the kind of strength we have for using the strength we have in the house as appropriate.
1259	In my speech on the first day of the year 1388, I made a few points about the issue of extravagance and the problems that exist in the area of productivity.	Shekaru biyun da suka gabata, a irin wannan jawabi na sabuwar shekara, na yi magana kan batun tsumi da matsalolin da suke cikin yadda ake amfani da albarkatun kasa.	in the past two years, in this new year's response, i discussed the issue of corruption and the problems associated with how natural resources are used.
1260	The people should know these things.	Wajibi ne mutane su fahimci wadannan abubuwa.	it is necessary for people to understand these things.
1261	I recommend that our government officials speak to the people about the importance of increasing the share of productivity in total economic growth of the country. They should tell the people how important it is to increase the share of productivity in economic growth of the country and how important it is to decrease the difference between the income of the poor and the rich.	Ina kiran jami'an kasar nan da su sanar da mutane wajibcin da ke cikin karfafa kason ci gaban tattalin arziki; su bayyana musu irin muhimmancin da ke cikin kara irin kason ci gaban tattalin arziki a kasar nan da kuma rage irin tazarar kudaden shiga tsakanin mutane.	i am calling on the authorities of this country to inform the people about the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions; to show them the significance of reducing these emissions in this country and also to reduce the disparity in income among people.
1262	Such differences are not favorable to us. Islam does not approve of such differences.	Wannan tazarar dai ba abu ne da muke so ba; Musulunci bai amince da hakan ba.	this competition is not what we want; islam does not agree with this.
1263	They should try to do these things according to the fifth development plan.	Wajibi ne su yi iyakacin kokarinsu da kuma yin aiki tukuru don cimma abin da aka tsara cikin wannan shiri na shekaru biyar na ci gaban kasa.	it is their duty to redouble their efforts and work hard to achieve what has been planned in this five-year plan for the progress of the country.
1264	Decreasing the unemployment rate is among the crucial issues of the country.	Rage yawan rashin aikin yi da kuma kara guraban aiki a kasar nan suna daga cikin lamurra masu muhimmanci kuma na asasi.	reducing unemployment and increasing job opportunities in this country are among the important and fundamental issues.
1265	Increasing private investments and helping the private sector to invest in economic projects of the country are also among the crucial issues. In this regard one of the important things that can be done is to establish cooperatives. Cooperatives can accumulate great capital and invest in important economic projects of the country.	Haka nan kuma kara irin jarin da 'yan kasuwa suke zubawa da kuma taimakon bangaren 'yan kasuwa don su sami damar zuba jari cikin fagen tattalin arziki na kasa, su ma suna daga cikin batutuwa masu muhimmanci kuma na asasi; wanda daya daga cikin ayyukan da ke da muhimmanci a wannan bangaren shi ne samar da kamfanonin hadin gwuiwa wadanda ta hanyar hada kudade za a iya samar da kudaden jari masu yawa da kafa manyan kamfanoni.	thus, they also increase the kind of trade that market people engage in and assist the market sector to have the opportunity to invest money in the country's economic sector, they are also among the important and fundamental issues; one of the important tasks in this sector is to create joint venture companies that through the combination of funds, can create a lot of money and establish large companies.
1266	It is necessary to prepare the legal requirements in this regard.	Wajibi ne a samar da tushe na dokoki.	it is necessary to provide a conclusion for the arguments.
1267	This means supporting the blossoming of labor.	Hakan kuwa yana nufin goyon bayan ci gaban ayyuka ne.	this indeed means supporting the advancement of work.
1268	As for economy in the use of essential resources, especially water resources, today 90 percent of our water resources are being used up by the agricultural sector.	Haka tsumulmula cikin albarkatun kasa na asasi ciki kuwa har da tsumulmula da kuma amfani da ruwa yadda ya dace. A yau kashi casa'in cikin dari na ruwan da muke da shi a kasar nan, ana amfani da shi ne a bangaren aikin gona.	this is how composting in the soil's nutrients is fundamentally involved, including composting and using water appropriately. today, a quarter of the water we have in this country is used in the agricultural sector.
1269	Just consider what will happen if the government succeeds in reforming the methods of irrigation and reduces this amount by only 10 percent.	Ku duba ku ga abin da zai faru idan har cikin yardar Allah gwamnati ta sami damar gyara hanyar ban ruwa, idan har aka rage kashi goma cikin dari na wannan kashi casa'in cikin dari din.	check and see what will happen if by the will of god the government is able to repair the waterway, if at least ten percent of this hundred percent is reduced.
1270	We only use 10 percent of our water resources for all other purposes - including household and industrial purposes. Imagine will happen if we spend 10 percent less water in the agricultural sector.	Baya ga bangaren aikin gona, a dukkanin bangarori na daban ma - bangaren amfani na gida, bangaren masana'antu da sauran bangarorin da suke bukatar ruwa - to kashi goma cikin dari na ruwan da ake samu kawai muke amfani da su a wadannan bangarori.	aside from the agricultural sector, in all other sectors - the domestic use sector, the scientific sector and other sectors that require water - we only use about ten percent of the water available in these sectors.
1271	In fact we will have twice as much water for non-agricultural sectors, which is very important.	A hakikanin gaskiya amfanin da za a samu daga ruwa a bangaren da ba aikin gona ba zai rubanya sau biyu; wanda hakan lamari ne mai girma da kuma muhimmanci.	in truth, the benefit that will be obtained from water in an area without farming will double; which is a matter of great importance and significance.
1272	The direct involvement of the people in economic matters is something necessary.	Shigowar mutane kai tsaye cikin lamurran tattalin arziki, lamari ne da ya zama wajibi.	the arrival of people standing in economic difficulties, it is a situation that has become obligatory.
1273	If we want this great economic movement to take place in our country in the year 1390, certain requirements should be met.	To, idan har muna son mu aiwatar da wannan yunkuri mai girma na tattalin arziki a kasar nan a shekara ta 1390, to akwai wadansu abubuwan da wajibi ne a aiwatar da su.	so, if we are to implement this ambitious economic plan in this country in the year 1390, there are some things that must be done.
1274	I would like to briefly mention these requirements.	Zan gabatar da jerin wadannan abubuwan da ake bukata.	i will present a list of these things that are needed.
1275	First of all, it is necessary to have the spirit of jihad.	Da farko dai ruhi na jihadi (kokari) wajibi ne.	firstly, striving (making effort) in the path of righteousness is obligatory.
1276	Since the beginning of the Revolution up until now, our people have been successful whenever they have entered the arena with the spirit of jihad. We saw this during the Sacred Defense and during reconstruction of the country. Currently we can see the same thing in the scientific movement of the country.	Al'ummar mu dai tun daga farkon nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci har zuwa yau din nan a duk inda ta shigo fage da ruhi na jihadi, to kuwa ta ci gaba; mun ga hakan a lokacin kallafaffen yaki, mun ga hakan a fagen jihadin gina kasa, haka nan kuma mun ga hakan a fagen ilimi.	our community, right from the onset of the success of the islamic revolution to this day, wherever it has penetrated, has continued to thrive; we have seen this during the war, we have seen this during the construction of the nation, and we have also seen this in the field of education.
1277	If we maintain this spirit of jihad in different areas - that is to say, if we do our duty for the sake of God in a tireless and serious manner - this movement will undoubtedly continue.	Idan har muka zamanto muna da ruhi na jihadi a bangarori daban-daban; wato aiki saboda Allah da kuma aiki tukuru ba kama hannun yaro - ba wai kawai a matsayin sauke nauyi ba - to ko shakka babu wannan yunkuri na mu zai ci gaba.	if we have indeed become imbued with a spirit of jihad in various fields; that is, working for allah and also working hard, not like a child's play - not just as a burden - then there is no doubt that this effort of ours will continue.
1278	The second requirement is to strengthen spirituality and the spirit of religious faith in society.	Na biyu shi ne karfafa ababen da suke kyautata ruhi da imani da kuma kishin addini cikin al'umma.	the second one is to strengthen the tools that promote spirit and faith and also religious tolerance in the society.
1279	Dear people, everybody should know that piety in our society and among our youth will help our nation in worldly matters as well.	Wajibi ne kowa da kowa ya san wannan; sanya kishin addini cikin kasa da kuma cikin matasa, hakan zai taimaka wa al'umma cikin lamurran da suka shafi duniyar su.	it is imperative that everyone knows this; instilling religious fear in the nation and among the youth, this will help the community in issues that affect the world.
1280	It is wrong to think that piety among the youth reveals its effects only during itikaf in mosques or when reciting Dua Kumeyl.	Bai kamata a yi zaton cewa tasirin sanya kishin addini cikin zukatan matasa, zai bayyana ne kawai a lokacin ittikafi a masallatai ko kuma a dararen juma'a a lokacin Dua Kumail ba.	it should not be assumed that the impact of instilling religious fear in the minds of the youth will only manifest during the observance of religious rites in mosques or during the dua kumail prayer on friday nights.
1281	If the youth enjoy piety, they will stay away from intemperance and addiction to drugs. They will start utilizing their talents and making efforts.	Idan har matasan wata al'umma suka zamanto masu kishin addini, to kuwa za su nesanci fasikanci; za su nesanci shan kwaya; za su nesanci munanan dabi'un da matasa suke aikatawa.	if the youth of a community become religious, they will indeed abhor immorality; they will abhor alcohol consumption; they will abhor the heinous acts that the youth engage in.
1282	The same is true of economy.	A fagen tattalin arziki ma haka lamarin yake.	in the business world, that's how the situation is.
1283	The spirit of piety and spirituality plays a very important role.	Karfin gwuiwa na addini, lamari ne da ke taka gagarumar rawa.	the strength of faith is a matter that carries great importance.
1284	The next requirement is that the country should not be distracted by side issues. Most of the time there is a central issue in the country which should be the focus of everybody's efforts.	Wani sharadin na gaba shi ne rashin nuna damuwa da ababe na bayan fage. Ku duba ku gani, a mafi yawan lokuta akwai lamurra na asali a wannan kasar wanda wajibi ne kowa da kowa ya ba da himma da kuma riko da wadannan lamurra; wajibi ne hakan ya zamanto shi ne abin da za a ba shi muhimmanci.	a major problem is the lack of concern for post-harvest losses. look and see, in most cases there are inherent challenges in this country that everyone must strive and cope with these challenges; it is necessary that this becomes something of importance.
1285	This is analogous to the situation of a caravan that is on an important mission and is moving through a desert towards its destination, but suddenly something unimportant attracts the attention of the caravan in one part of the desert and it stops moving forward.	Hakan zai zamanto tamkar jirgin kasa ne da ke dauke da mutane da ya kama hanya yana son isa ga wani waje na musamman, kwatsam kawai sai wani karamin abu ya bayyana ya shagaltar da shi a tsakiyar sahara, sai a bar shi a kan hanya, a wasu lokutan ma a kan hana shi tafiya din ne.	this would seem like an airplane carrying people who have taken a route wanting to reach a certain place, just a little thing appears and distracts it in the middle of the desert, then leaves it on the road, sometimes even preventing it from moving.
1286	Side issues should not be brought into focus.	A saboda haka bai kamata a shigo da lamurra na bayan fage cikin fage ba.	therefore, it is not advisable to enter into post-dusk affairs in the dark.
1287	Preserving unity and national solidarity is another requirement.	Wani sharadin na daban shi ne kiyaye hadin kai da fahimtar juna ta kasa.	another challenge is maintaining communication and understanding between each other in a country.
1288	It is necessary to maintain and strengthen the unity that exists among and between the people and government officials. The people love their government officials. They trust their officials.	Wannan hadin kan da a yau ake da shi tsakanin mutane da kuma tsakanin mutane da jami'an gwamnati, (wato) mutane suna kaunar jami'an su, sun yarda da su, suna taimaka musu da kuma kasancewa tare da su, sannan kuma akwai hadin kai da fahimtar juna a tsakanin su kansu mutanen, to wajibi ne (irin wannan yanayin) ya ci gaba da wanzuwa sannan kuma a ci gaba da karfafa shi a kowace rana.	this harmony that exists today among people and between people and government officials, where people love the officials, accept them, help them and also live with them, and there is mutual understanding among them, it is necessary (such a situation) to continue and to be strengthened every day.
1289	One of the big plots of the enemies of the Iranian nation is to foment discord inside the country under ethnic, religious, political and partisan pretexts.	Daya daga cikin babban makircin makiyan al'ummar Iran, shi ne haifar da rarrabuwa da sabani na cikin gida; suna masu fakewa da batun kabilanci, mazhaba, akida ta siyasa da kuma kungiyanci da dai sauran batutuwa daban-daban.	one of the major challenges facing the iranian society is the creation of division and hatred within the home; they are dealing with issues of ethnicity, sect, political beliefs, and also group affiliation and other various issues.
1290	Fortunately our nation is vigilant.	Abin farin cikin shi ne cewa al'ummar mu a farke take.	his joy is that our community is in peace.
1291	All those who care about the country and religious democracy - which is a source of pride for the Iranian nation - should cooperate in a harmonious manner.	Dukkanin mutanen da suke kaunar kasar su, suke kaunar tsarin demokradiyya na addini wanda hakan abin alfahari ne ga al'ummar Iran - to wajibi ne su tabbatar da fahimtar juna a tsakaninsu.	all the people who love this country, they love the religious democratic system which is a matter of pride for the iranian nation - so it is their duty to ensure mutual understanding among themselves.
1292	Government officials should do the same.	Haka ya kamata su ma jami'an gwamnati su kasance; wajibi ne su yi kokari wajen ganin cewa ko da a ce akwai wani sabani a tsakaninsu - mai yiyuwa ne ma a wani lokacin korafin da suke da shi din ya zamanto na gaskiya ne - to kada su bayyanar da hakan a gaban mutane; don kuwa hakan zai cutar da hadin kai na kasa ne.	this is how government officials should be; it is their duty to strive to ensure that even if there is a disagreement among them - which sometimes happens in any setting where the truth is involved - they should not expose this to the public; because this would disrupt the unity of the country.
1293	I seriously warn our government officials about this issue.	Lalle ni ina jan kunnen jami'an gwamnati sosai kan wannan lamarin.	indeed, i am very critical of the government officials on this issue.
1294	It is possible to negotiate a solution to the most important issues of the world, let alone such trivial issues.	Mafi muhimmancin lamarin duniya a kan magance shi ta hanyar tattaunawa; wadannan kananan lamurra ba su da muhimmanci.	the most important thing in the world is to solve it through dialogue; these small issues are not important.
1295	Sometimes after I announce a slogan at the beginning of the year, I see placards hanging everywhere - in Tehran and other cities of the country - with the slogan written on them.	Tabbas ne in sake tunatarwa kan wannan lamarin; a wani lokaci wannan suna da muke ba wa shekara, kwatsam kawai sai ka ga an cika katangun birnin Tehran da na sauran garuruwa da rubuce-rubuce kan hakan, wato a ta rubuta wannan taken.	indeed, if i were to remind myself of this issue; sometimes we have been giving it a year, just a glance and you will see that the city of tehran and other cities are full of writings about this, that is, writing this title.
1296	This is useless.	Hakan ba shi da wani amfani.	this has no use.
1297	Measures that are sometimes adopted are expensive, yet unnecessary.	A wasu lokuta ma a kan kashe kudade masu yawa sosai, mene ne wajibcin da ke cikin hakan?	sometimes a lot of money is spent, what is the necessity in that?
1298	What I expect from government officials and from our dear people is that they should listen to these slogans and try to practice them.	Abin da nake fatan gani a wajen mutane da kuma jami'an gwamnati shi ne su saurari wannan taken, su amince da shi sannan kuma su a yi kokari wajen ganin an tabbatar da shi.	what i hope to see from people and government officials is for them to listen to this topic, accept it, and then make an effort to ensure it is confirmed.
1299	In this regard there is no need to do something that is expensive.	Babu wata bukatar ta gudanar da ayyukan da za a kashe kudade masu yawa.	there is no need to carry out activities that will waste a lot of money.
1300	Of course the central importance of economic matters does not mean that we should ignore other areas.	Ko da yake ba da muhimmanci ga batun tattalin arziki da na fadi ba wai yana nufin a yi watsi da sauran bangarorin ba ne.	even though the economic issue i mentioned is not important, it doesn't mean to ignore the other issues.
1301	It is necessary to pay attention to other areas as well, especially science and technology, and to help and trust our young scientists so that they can make great achievements.	A sauran bangarorin ma, musamman a fagen ilimi da fasaha, lalle wajibi ne a taimaka wa wadannan masana matasa, a yarda da su, don su sami damar gudanar da manyan ayyuka.	as for the rest of the fields, especially in the field of education and eloquence, it is indeed necessary to assist these young scholars, to agree with them, so that they have the opportunity to perform great tasks.
1302	As for the regional issues, the recent events which have happened in the region - in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Bahrain - are very important.	To amma dangane da lamurran da suke faruwa a wannan yankin kuwa. Abubuwan da a baya-bayan nan suke faruwa - wato lamurran kasar Masar, Tunusiya, Libya da Bahrain - lamurra ne masu muhimmancin gaske.	however, regarding the events happening in this region. the things that have been happening - that is, the events of egypt, tunisia, libya, and bahrain - are truly important events.
1303	A fundamental change is taking place in this Islamic and Arab region. This is a sign of Islamic Awakening.	Wani gagarumin sauyi ne yake faruwa a wannan yanki na musulmi da larabawa; hakan alama ce ta farkawa ta Musulunci da ake samu.	a slight change is happening in this muslim and arab region; this is a sign of the emergence of islam that is being observed.
1304	The same thing which has been shouted as a slogan in the Islamic Republic for decades is revealing itself in the context of these countries. These developments have two characteristics: one is the presence of the people, and other is the religious orientation of these movements.	Wannan lamari da shekara da shekaru kenan ake daga takensa a Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran, to sai ga shi a yau yana nuna kansa cikin rayuwar kasashe. Akwai wadansu siffofi guda biyu da wadannan lamari ya kebanta da su: na farko shi ne batun kasantuwar mutane, na biyu kuma shi ne riko da addini da kuma komawa gare shi.	this event, which has been going on for years in the islamic republic of iran, is now manifesting itself in the lives of nations. there are two characteristics that distinguish this event: the first is the issue of human dignity, and the second is the connection with religion and returning to it.
1305	These are two essential characteristics.	Wadannan abubuwa ne na asasi guda biyu.	these are the two basic things.
1306	The physical presence of the people - this is what happened in the Islamic Revolution.	Kasantuwar mutane a fage; shi ne irin wannan yanayi da ya faru a lokacin juyin juya halin Musulunci na Iran.	the migration of people is massive; it is like this kind of situation that happened during the decline of the state of islam in iran.
1307	Parties, people who live in their ivory towers and political analysts could not do anything.	Kungiyoyi da jam'iyyu da wadanda suke zaune a kan tebura da kuma cikin manyan gidaje da masu sharhi cikin kwakwalwa sun gagara aikata komai.	groups and associations that reside on tables and inside big houses and commentators in the wilderness have completely done everything.
1308	The art of our magnanimous Imam was that he managed to encourage the people to enter the arena.	Babbar fasahar Imamin mu mai girma ita ce ya sami damar shigo da mutane cikin fage.	our esteemed imam's great knowledge is what allows him to bring people into the fold.
1309	Today the same thing is happening in other countries.	To a yau ma irin wannan lamari ne yake faruwa a kasashen (larabawa).	even today, such incidents are happening in arab countries.
1310	In Egypt and Tunisia it was the people who entered the arena, otherwise intellectuals and those who live in ivory towers were always there and they were talking all along. They often called on the people to protest, but nobody would listen to them.	A kasar Masar ko kuma Tunusiya mutane ne suka shigo fage da kansu; idan kuwa ba haka ba to ai daman masana da masu zaune cikin manyan gidaje a ko da yaushe sun kasance suna magana; a lokuta da dama ma sun kasance suna kiran mutane, babu wani da ya damu sosai da wadannan maganganu da suke fadi.	in egypt or tunisia, people have taken to the streets; if not, then it is likely that scholars and those living in large houses are always talking; often they are calling people, no one is really bothered by these words they are saying.
1311	This time it was the people who entered the arena with a religious orientation.	A nan su kansu mutanen ne suka shigo cikin fage, sannan kuma akida da manufarsu ta addini ce.	there, they themselves are the people who entered into poverty, and then their belief and their religious fear is also there.
1312	Friday prayers, congregational prayers, Name of God, religious scholars, promoters of religion, founders of new schools of religious thought in certain countries - these were the elements that encouraged the people to step in.	Wato abubuwan da suka tara su ne sallar juma'a, sallar jam'i, sunan Allah, malaman addini, mutane masu isar da sakon addini da kuma masu bayanin mahangar addini a kasashe. Da suka shigo cikin fage, don haka sai su ma mutane suka shigo cikin fagen.	that is, the things that gathered them are the friday prayer, the congregational prayer, the name of god, religious scholars, people who deliver religious messages, and those who explain religious dangers in countries. they entered into poverty, so people also entered into poverty.
1313	This is a characteristic of these events.	Wannan ita ce siffar da wannan lamarin ya kebanta da ita.	this is the issue that this matter has distinguished her with.
1314	Why did the people step into the arena?	To me ya sa suka fiton?	why did they come out?
1315	The oppressive rulers in Egypt, Tunisia and other countries had hurt the pride of the people.	A kasar Masar, a kasar Tunusiya, haka nan a sauran kasashe, wadannan sarakuna da azzaluman shugabanni sun zubar wa mutane da mutumcinsu.	in egypt, in tunisia, and in other countries, these rulers and despots have stripped people of their humanity.
1316	For example, the people of Egypt had to see the leader of their country commit the worst and most hideous crimes for Israel.	A matsayin misali mutanen kasar Masar suna ganin shugabansu, don biyan bukatar haramtacciyar kasar Isra'ila, yana aikata mafi munin ayyuka.	as an example, the people of egypt see their leaders as serving the needs of the banned nation of israel, committing the most heinous acts.
1317	If Hosni Mubarak had not cooperated with Israel in the case of the siege on Gaza, Israel could not have pressured the people of Gaza like that.	Idan da a ce Hosni Mubarak bai hada kai da haramtacciyar kasar Isra'ila cikin killacewar da aka yi wa Gaza ba, to da kuwa Isra'ilan ba za ta iya aikata irin wannan cutarwar da ta yi wa mutanen Gazan ba.	if it is said that hosni mubarak did not collude with the criminal state of israel in the siege imposed on gaza, then israel would not have been able to carry out this kind of massacre on the people of gaza.
1318	But Hosni Mubarak stepped in and helped Israel to block the way to Gaza.	Amma sai Hosni Mubarak ya shigo cikin fage, ya taimaka, ya rufe hanyar shigowa da kuma fita daga Masar.	but then hosni mubarak stepped in, helped, and closed the route of entry and exit from egypt.
1319	Then they realized that the people of Gaza had dug tunnels under the ground. In order to stop the oppressed people of Gaza from using these tunnels, they built steel walls around them which ran 30 meters below the surface and cut through the tunnels.	A lokacin da ya sami labarin cewa mutanen Gaza suna bi ta karkashin kasa, ta cikin ramuka (don shigar da abubuwan da suke bukata), don ya hana su yin hakan sai ya gina wata katanga ta karfe mai tsawon mita talatin, ya shigar da ita cikin kasa, don ya rufe hanyar shiga din.	when he heard that the people of gaza were living underground, in tunnels (to smuggle in the things they needed), to prevent them from doing so he built a thirty meter deep wall, inserted it into the ground, and blocked the entrance.
1320	It was Hosni Mubarak who did this.	Wannan shi ne abin da Hosni Mubarak ya aikata.	this is what hosni mubarak did.
1321	Similar things happened in other countries as well.	Ana iya ganin makamancin hakan ma cikin wasu kasashen na daban.	one can see the relative nature of this in other different countries.
1322	For example, Gadhafi showed an anti-western attitude during the first few years of his rule, but he has rendered great services to the west during the recent years.	A matsayin misali a kasar Libiya, duk kuwa da cewa a shekarun farko-farko na darewa mulkinsa, Gaddafi ya nuna akidar kyama da kuma kiyayyar kasashen yammaci, to amma cikin shekarun baya-bayan nan ya aiwatar da hidima mai girma ga kasashen yammaci.	as an example in libya, despite initially showing a belief in forgiveness and respect for western countries during his early years in power, gaddafi later carried out significant actions against western countries.
1323	The people of Libya saw that a simple threat was enough to make Gadhafi load all the nuclear facilities of his country onto a ship and tell westerners to take them away.	(Mutanen Libiya) da idanuwansu sun ga cewa daga 'yar wata barazana da aka yi masa, sai ga shi ya tattara dukkanin kwarewa da kayan aiki na nukiliyansa, ya sanya su cikin jirgin ruwa, ya mika wa mutanen yammaci, ya ce ku tafi da su!	the people of libya and their eyes have seen that from a certain calamity that befell him, he gathered all his wisdom and nuclear work tools, put them in a submarine, handed them over to the people of the west, and said you go with them!
1324	Just compare the situation of our nation with the Libyan nation.	Ku duba ku ga matsayin da al'ummar mu take da shi, sannan su kuma (wadancan) a wani matsayin suke.	look and see the status our community is in, and then they (those people) are also in a certain status.
1325	Not only did our government officials not retreat, but they also increased our nuclear facilities by several times each year against the wish of the enemy.	Amma jami'an kasar mu ba wai ma kawai ba su ja da baya ba ne, face ma dai sabanin abin da makiyan suke so a kowace shekara sai kara rubanya shirin ake yi.	but not all of our country's people are just left behind, but rather, every year they continue to increase the plan they want.
1326	The same thing can be seen in all the countries whose people have revolted against their governments.	Ana iya ganin irin wadannan cin mutumcin cikin dukkanin wadannan kasashe da mutane suka yunkura.	one can see this kind of inhumanity in all these countries that people have created.
1327	This is important to us.	Wannan shi ne abin da ke da muhimmanci a gare mu.	this is what is important to us.
1328	After these events took place, they adopted contradictory positions because they did not have an appropriate understanding of the events and because they did not know the people.	Bayan da wadannan abubuwa suka faru, to da yake ba su fahimci lamarin ba, ba su san mutane ba, sai su ka dau matakai masu karo da juna.	after these things happened, they didn't understand the situation, they didn't know people, they just took steps to avoid each other.
1329	Of course in the case of these and other countries, America's support for dictators is a point which has been constantly noticed about America's behavior. They supported Hosni Mubarak as long as they could. Then they realized that it was not possible to keep him in power, so they threw him away.	Ko da yake abubuwan da ya zuwa yanzu aka gani daga wajen Amurka dangane da wadannan kasashe da sauran kasashen na daban, shi ne goyon bayan shugabanni 'yan kama-karya. Sun kasance masu kare Hosni Mubarak har zuwa karshen yadda za su iya; to amma a lokacin da suka ga cewa daga yanzu kan ba za su iya ba, sai suka yi watsi da shi.	regardless of what has been seen so far from america regarding these countries and other different countries, it is in support of their deceptive leaders. they have been supporting hosni mubarak until the end of what they could; but when they saw that from now on they could not, they abandoned him.
1330	This is a lesson to the leaders of other countries who are dependent on America.	Shi kansa hakan wani darasi ne ga shugabannin da suka dogara da Amurka na su fahimci cewa daga lokacin da amfaninsu ya kare sannan kuma ba su da wani amfani (a gare su) to nan take za su yi jefa da su tamkar wata tsumma maras amfani, ba za su taba damuwa da su ba.	this is a lesson for leaders who have relied on america to understand that once their usefulness has ended, and they have no other use (for them), they will discard them like a useless husk, they will never worry about them.
1331	But they supported and defended the dictator until the last moment. What happened was truly intolerable to America and the west.	Abin da ya faru ga kasashen yammaci da kuma ita kanta Amurka, lalle abu ne da ba za su taba amincewa da shi ba.	what happened to the winter countries and america itself, is certainly something they will never agree with.
1332	Egypt is one of the main pillars of America's Middle Eastern policies. They were relying on Egypt.	Kasar Masar daya ne daga cikin tushen siyasar Amurka gabas ta tsakiya ne; lalle sun dogara da wannan siyasar.	egypt is one of the pillars of american policy in the middle east; they certainly rely on this policy.
1333	Then the Americans tried to preserve the structure of the Egyptian regime.	To amma sun gagara kiyaye wannan tushe don ya ci gaba da amfaninsu.	however, they have greatly maintained this aspect in order to continue benefiting from it.
1334	If nations stay vigilant, they can easily expose America's hypocrisy and foil its plots.	Wanda idan har mutane su ka zamanto a farke, za su iya kawar da wannan magudi da kuma lalata wannan makirci na su.	those who, when people become angry, can suppress this anger and also forgive their mistakes.
1335	After losing Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Ben Ali in Tunisia, the Americans tried to preserve the structure of their regimes.	Amurkawa sun yi kokarinsu wajen ganin tun da dai sun rasa Mubarak a Masar ko kuma Ben Ali a Tunusiya, to bari su yi kokarin kare irin tsarin gwamnatinsu.	the revolutions have tried to ensure that since they have lost mubarak in egypt or ben ali in tunisia, they should strive to protect their government system.
1336	They overthrew those governments as well. By Allah's favor, America's failures will continue in the region.	Da yardar Allah, sannan kuma da ikonsa, Amurka za ta ci gaba da shan kashi a wannan yankin.	by the grace of god, and with his permission, america will continue to experience progress in this region.
1337	After they lost their agents in these countries, they took two courses of action. One was opportunism, and the other was simulation. Through opportunism they tried to hijack these revolutions.	Bayan da suka rasa mutanen su a wadannan kasashe, sai suka sanya wasu abubuwa guda biyu da suke son cimmawa a gabansu: na farko shi ne jiran tsammani, na biyu kuma shi ne kokarin haifar da makamancin wannan lamarin a wasu wajajen.	after they lost their people in these countries, they set two things they want to achieve: the first is waiting for hope, and the second is trying to create a sense of this issue in other places.
1338	They were unsuccessful in this regard.	To sun sha kashi dai a wannan aikin.	they have eaten only a little in this work.
1339	Simulation was the second plot - that is to say, they tried to simulate the events of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and certain other countries in Iran, the country that enjoys religious democracy and a populist government.	Na biyu shi ne kamanta hakan. abin nufi da kamanta hakan shi ne su samar da irin abubuwan da suka faru a kasashen Masar da Tunusiya da Libiya a wasu kasashen na daban.	the second is the interpretation of this. the purpose of interpreting this is to provide the kind of things that happened in countries like egypt, tunisia and libya in other countries.
1340	What they are doing is true hypocrisy: they claim to support nations.	Munafunci na asali shi ne wannan abin da suke aikatawa, wato ikirarin kare hakkokin mutane.	the fundamental hypocrisy is this thing they are doing, that is, claiming to protect people's rights.
1341	They are hypocritical about Egypt. They say they support the Egyptian people. Our dear people should know that America's President has sent a message to the Iranian nation, saying that he supports them.	To bai baci ba idan har al'ummar mu masu girma suka fahimci cewa shugaban kasar Amurka ya aika wa al'ummar Iran sako yana fadin cewa mu din nan masu goyon bayanku ne! suna ikirarin cewa su din nan suna adawa da masu mulkin kama-karya, suna tare da hakkokin al'ummomi; amma karya suke yi.	it's not a joke if our mature population understands that the president of the united states has sent a message to the people of iran saying that we here are your supporters! they claim that they are enemies of the corrupt rulers, they are with the rights of the general public; but they are lying.
1342	Not only do they not show mercy to other nations, but they also show no mercy to their own people.	Su din ba wai ma kawai ba sa tausayawa sauran al'ummomi ba ne, face ma hatta al'ummominsu ba sa tausaya musu.	they are not only lacking in compassion for other communities, but even their own community does not receive their compassion.
1343	In spite of America's critical economic situation, the current US President spent hundreds of billions of dollars from the tax paid by US citizens in order to keep banks, arms companies and oil industries going. That is to say, he is spending the money that belongs to the American people on American companies and banks.	Shi kansa wannan shugaban kasar Amurkan na yanzu ya yi amfani da biliyoyin dalolin mutane a irin wannan mummunan yanayi na tattalin arziki da Amurka take fama da shi don ya sake rayar da bankuna; don ya rayar da masana'antun makamai, don ya rayar da masana'antun mai; wato yayi hakan ne don rayar da kamfanoni.	he himself, this current american president, is now using people's grievances as a tool in this terrible economic climate that america is suffering from to revive banks; to revive the oil industry, to revive the corn industry; that is, he did this to revive companies.
1344	Therefore, they do not even show mercy to their own people.	Yana tatse mutane don rayar da kamfanoni, suna cika aljihun kamfanoni, suna cika aljihunnan bankuna; a saboda haka ba sa tausayawa hatta al'ummominsu.	he is oppressing people for the sake of companies, they are filling the treasuries of companies, they are filling the coffers of our banks; for this reason, they have no mercy even for their own people.
1345	Today the American nation is struggling with the widespread economic crisis, and it does not have a solution.	A yau al'ummar Amurka tana cikin matsalar tattalin arziki, sannan kuma ba su da mafita.	today, the american population is in an economic crisis, and they also have no solution.
1346	The torture centers of Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and other torture centers are another issue.	Baya ga gidajen yari da wajen azabtar da mutane irin su Guantanamo da Abu Ghraib na kasar Iraki da sauran wajajen da suke azabtar da mutane da suke wajaje daban-daban.	beyond the prisons of torture and the places where people like guantanamo and abu ghraib in iraq and other places where people are tortured are different.
1347	They do not understand nations.	Mutane ba sa fahimtar wadannan abubuwa, ba sa gane su.	people do not understand these things, they do not recognize them.
1348	Does the current US President know what he is saying?	Shin shugaban Amurka na yanzun ya san me yake fadi kuwa?	does the current president of america know what he is saying?
1349	Does he really understand who are behind his policies, or is he unaware and confused? We do not know the answer to these questions.	Shin a hakikanin gaskiya ya san mutanen da suke bayan fage da suke juya siyasarsa, ko kuma bai fahimta ba ya gafala?	does he really know the people who are behind the scene and are manipulating his politics, or is he just ignorant?
1350	He says that the people who had gathered at Tehran's Azadi Square are like the people at Egypt's Tahrir Square.	Yana fadin cewa mutanen da suke dandalin Azadi ('yanci) na Tehran, su ne dai mutanen da suke dandalin 'yanci na Masar.	he says that the people who are on the path of azadi (freedom) in tehran, they are indeed the people who are on the path of freedom in egypt.
1351	"He is right: each year on the 22nd of Bahman, the people of Iran gather at Azadi Square and shout ""death to America""."	"To e gaskiya yake fadi; don kuwa a kowace ranar 22 ga watan Bahman na kowace shekara, mutanen da suke taruwa a wannan dandalin na 'yanci, taken da suke rerawa shi ne ""Allah Ya la'anci Amurka""."	"he is indeed telling the truth; because on the 22nd of every bahman month each year, the people who gather in this square chant ""god curse america""."
1352	The position of the Islamic Republic on the regional issues is clear.	Dangane da lamurran da ke faruwa a wannan yankin, matsayar Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran dai a fili take.	regarding the events happening in this region, the islamic republic of iran is visibly involved.
1353	We seek to defend nations and their rights.	Matsayar mu, ita ce goyon bayan al'ummomi da hakkokinsu.	our mission is to advocate for the public and their rights.
1354	This is the position of the Iranian nation and the position of the Islamic system. This is the clear position adopted by the Islamic Republic.	Wannan ita ce matsayar tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci; wannan ita ce fitacciyar matsayar tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci.	this is the standard system of the islamic republic; this is the advanced standard system of the islamic republic.
1355	These are the policies. These are what the hearts, minds and tongues of our people and government officials say.	Siyasar mu ita ce wannan, zukatanmu su ne wadannan, hikima da kuma abubuwan da muke fadi su ne wadannan, shin ta bakin mutane ne ko kuma ta bakin jami'an gwamnati.	our politics is this, these are our viewpoints, the wisdom and things we say are these, is it for the people or for the government officials.
1356	There are two things which are worthy of attention. One is the issue of Libya, and the other is the issue of Bahrain.	Akwai wadansu wajaje guda biyu da ya kamata a lura da su a nan: na farko ita ce kasar Libiya, na biyu kuma ita ce kasar Bahrain.	there are two notable countries that should be observed here: the first is libya, and the second is bahrain.
1357	Regarding the Libyan issue we utterly condemn the behavior of the Libyan government - killing and pressuring the people, dropping bombs on cities and killing civilians. But we also utterly condemn the interference of America and westerners in Libya.	Dangane da kasar Libiya, mu dai dari bisa dari muna Allah wadai da irin mu'amalar da gwamnatin Libiya take yi wa mutane da irin kisan gillan da ta yi wa mutane da kuma bama-baman da ta sauke a kan garuruwa da kuma fararen hula; to amma shigowar Amurkawa, tsoma bakin Amurka da sauran kasashen yammaci ma muna Allah wadai da shi dari bisa dari.	regarding libya, we are deeply concerned about the way the libyan government is treating its people and the killings and bombings it has inflicted on cities and innocent people; but with the arrival of the americans, we are equally concerned about the actions of america and other western countries.
1358	They claim that they want to enter Libya or carry out military operations to defend the people. This is not at all acceptable.	Suna da'awar cewa mu mun shiga kasar Libiya ne don kare mutane, ko kuma don mu kai hare-haren soji, to wannan dai ba abin da za a amince da shi ba ne.	they claim that we entered libya to protect people, or to wage military campaigns, but this is not something that will be agreed upon.
1359	It is one month that the people of Libya are being bombed. If you truly support the Libyan people, if you really care about the Libyan people, you should help them.	Idan har su din nan sun kasance masu goyon bayan al'ummar Libiya na hakika ne, idan har zukatansu suna kuna saboda halin da mutanen Libiya suke ciki, to a halin yanzu wata guda aka yi ana ruwan bama-bamai a kan al'ummar Libiya.	if indeed they are supporters of the libyan people, if their concern is for the situation the libyan people are in, then currently, a step has been taken to pour cold water on the libyan people.
1360	You should give them the facilities they need.	Idan har kuna son ku taimaka musu, to ku ba su makami, ku ba su kayan aiki, ku ba su makamai masu kakkabo jiragen sama.	if you really want to help them, then give them fish, give them work tools, give them useful flying aircraft.
1361	Instead of doing these things, they stood by and watched the people being killed for one month. Now they want to step in. Therefore, you have not come to defend the people.	Maimakon hakan wata guda kenan kuka zauna kuna kallon yadda ake kashe mutane; sai yanzu ne za ku shigo. A saboda haka ba saboda kare mutane kuka shigo ba; ku din nan kuna son man fetur din kasar Libiya ne, ku din nan kuna son tabbatar da matsayinku ne a kasar Libiyan.	instead of sitting there watching people being killed; now is the time for you to step in. not because you want to save people's lives; you are there because you love libya's oil, you are there to secure your interests in libya.
1362	You want to use Libya as a foothold in order to monitor the future revolutionary governments of Egypt and Tunisia, which are located on the east and west of Libya.	Kuna son ku sami wani waje ne da za ku kafa kafafunku don ku yi amfani da shi wajen killace gwamnatocin juyin juya hali da za a kafa a nan gaba a kasashen Masar da Tunusiya, ku zamanto kuna sa ido a kansu.	you want to find a place where you can establish your bases to use in overthrowing governments and creating chaos that will be established in the future in countries like egypt and tunisia, you are watching them closely.
1363	Your intention is evil.	Niyyar ku bakar aniya ce.	your desire is my command.
1364	The United Nations, which should serve the interests of nations, has unfortunately turned into a tool in the hands of these people. It just provides what they need.	Ita kanta Majalisar Dinkin Duniya wacce ya kamata ta zamanto mai hidima wa al'ummomi, abin bakin cikin sai ta zamanto makami a hannun wadancan mutanen; duk abin da suke so sai ta samar musu da shi.	she herself is the united nations, which should become a servant to the public, the bitter thing is that she should become a puppet in the hands of those people; whatever they want, she provides it for them.
1365	This is a disgrace for the United Nations.	To wannan dai abin kunya ne ga Majalisar Dinkin Duniyan.	this is indeed a disgrace to the united nations.
1366	Therefore, the presence of foreign powers and westerners in Libya is totally unacceptable.	A saboda haka kasantuwar sojojin kasashen waje, da kasantuwar 'yan kasashen yammaci ba abu ne da za a amince da shi ba.	therefore, the competence of foreign soldiers and the competence of foreigners is not something that will be accepted.
1367	If they want to help the people of Libya, the door is open: they can help and equip the people, and the people will settle their issues with Gadhafi and others. Why do you enter Libya?	Idan har kuna son ku taimaka wa al'ummar Libiya, to kuwa hanyar taimakonsu a bude take; za ku iya taimaka wa mutane, ku karfafa su, su kansu mutanen kasar su magance matsalar da ke tsakaninsu da Gaddafi da kansu; don me ya sa kuka shigo ciki?	if you really want to help the people of libya, then their way of helping is open; you can help people, empower them, let them themselves, the people of the country, solve the problem between them and gaddafi and theirs; why did you get involved?
1368	Their main demand is that there should be elections in which each person can have one vote.	Babbar bukatarsu ita ce a gudanar da zabe, kowane mutum guda ya zamanto yana da kuri'a guda; shin hakan bukata ce mai girma?	their main requirement is to conduct the election, each person has one vote; is this a big requirement?
1369	Is this too much to expect? In Bahrain there is a superficial democratic façade, but the Bahraini people cannot really vote. They are being oppressed.	Shin wannan fata ce mai girma? A aikace ana gudanar da zabe a kasar Bahrain, to sai dai a yanayi na gaba daya mutane ba su da hakki na kuri'a da irin ma'anar da aka sani, ba su da irin wannan yanayi; ana zaluntar su ne.	is this a significant victory? elections are being conducted in bahrain, but in the future, people do not have the right to vote and the kind of meaning known, they do not have this kind of climate; they are being oppressed.
1370	Westerners took this opportunity to interfere in the affairs of the regional countries by bringing up a new issue: the Shia-Sunni issue.	To, a nan sai 'yan kasashen yammaci su ka yi amfani da wannan dama, don su sami damar tsoma baki cikin lamurran wannan yanki ta hanyar gabatar da wani sabon abu; wanda shi ne lamarin Shi'a da Sunna.	well, here the people of the northern countries should take advantage of this opportunity to gain a voice in the affairs of this region by presenting something new; which is the issue of shi'a and sunna.
1371	Just because the poor people of Bahrain happen to be Shia, nobody in the world should support them.	Saboda mutanen Bahrain abin tausayi 'yan Shi'a ne, a saboda haka babu wani da yake da hakkin ya goyi bayansu.	because the people of bahrain are predominantly shia, therefore no one has the right to discriminate against them.
1372	The TV channels that used to cover the details of the regional issues should now be silent about the events in Bahrain.	Gidajen talabijin din da suke watsa abubuwan da suke faruwa a wannan yankin, to amma sai ga shi sun yi shiru kan lamarin Bahrain, ba sa fadin abin da ke faruwa na irin zubar da jinin mutanen Bahrain da ake yi.	the television stations that broadcast events happening in this area, but they have been silent on the issue of bahrain, they do not report on the kind of bloodshed that is happening to the people of bahrain.
1373	And then some people in Persian Gulf States - whether politicians or journalists - start talking nonsense, saying that the issue of Bahrain is a Shia-Sunni war.	Sannan kuma aka sami wasu mutane daga kasashen Tekun Fasha - shin 'yan siyasa ne ko kuma 'yan jarida - suka zo suna fadi shirmensa, suna fadin cewa lamarin Bahrain lamari ne na Shi'a da Sunna!	then some people from the turkish countries were found - whether politicians or journalists - they came expressing their surprise, saying that the bahrain issue is a matter of shi'a and sunna!
1374	It is the protest of a nation against the oppression that is being imposed on it, just like what happened in Tunisia and Egypt and just like what is happening in Libya and Yemen: there is no difference.	Nuna rashin amincewar wata al'umma ce da zaluncin da ake yi mata; kamar abin da ya faru a kasar Tunusiya, kamar yadda ya faru a Masar, kamar abubuwan da suke faruwa a kasar Libiya, haka nan tamkar abin da ke faruwa ne a Yemen; babu wani bambanci.	show the lack of acceptance of a society with the oppression being done to it; like what happened in tunisia, like what happened in egypt, like the things happening in libya, just like what is happening in yemen; there is no difference.
1375	The Americans would be happy to use their propaganda machines in the region and pass off the issue of Bahrain as a Shia-Sunni conflict.	Amurkawa sun yi farin cikin cewa sun sami nasarar kiran wannan lamari a matsayin sabani tsakanin Shi'a da Sunna ta hanyar kafafen watsa labarai da hanyoyin farfagandarsu.	the americans were pleased to announce the success of this initiative as a bridge between shia and sunni through their media outlets and propaganda methods.
1376	They ask why Iran is supporting the people of Bahrain.	Suna fadin cewa da wani dalili ne mutanen Iran suke goyon bayan mutanen Bahrain.	they are saying that for some reason, the people of iran support the people of bahrain.
1377	Well, we support everybody.	To mu dai mun goyi bayan dukkaninsu.	we have indeed followed all of them.
1378	We have been supporting the Palestinian people for 32 years. Which country, which government and which nation has offered support to the Palestinian nation during the past 32 years?	Mu dai shekaru talatin da biyu kenan mu ke goyon bayan al'ummar Palastinu; wata kasa ce, wata gwamnati ce, wata al'umma ce ta ba su irin wannan goyon bayan da Iran ta ba su tsawon shekaru talatin da biyun nan?	we are now thirty-two years in support of the palestinian people; which country, which government, which nation has given them the kind of support that iran has given them over these thirty-two years?
1379	Are the Palestinian people Shia?	Shin mutanen Palastinu 'yan Shi'a ne?	are the people of palestine shi'a?
1380	Once our youth went to the airport, prepared to go to Gaza.	Matasan mu sun tafi filin jirgin sama don a ba su damar tafiya Gaza!	our youths have gone to the airport to give them the opportunity to travel to gaza!
1381	They wanted to go to Gaza and fight Israel.	A shirye suke su tafi Gaza, su yaki Isra'ila.	they are planning to go to gaza, to fight israel.
1382	We told them not to go.	Mu muka ce kada su tafi.	we told them not to leave.
1383	Our people expressed their emotions in the case of Gaza, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia and other places.	Mutanen mu sun bayyanar da goyon bayansu ga mutane Gaza, ga Palastinu, ga Masar, ga Tunusiya; su kuwa ba 'yan Shi'a ba ne.	our people have expressed their solidarity with the people of gaza, palestine, egypt, and tunisia; they are not shi'a.
1384	Therefore, this is not a Shia-Sunni issue.	A saboda haka lamarin ba batun Shi'a ko Sunna ba ne.	therefore, the issue is not about shia or sunni.
1385	They are making spiteful and malevolent efforts to present the issue of Bahrain as a Shia-Sunni issue.	Masu neman sharri suna kokarin bayyanar da batun Bahrain a matsayin wani lamari na Shi'a da Sunna.	those seeking evil are trying to portray the issue of bahrain as a shi'a and sunni matter.
1386	Unfortunately some people who do not have any evil motives fell into this trap.	Abin bakin cikin shi ne cewa yadda wasu mutane wadanda ake zaton ba su da mummunar manufa su ka fada wannan tarko na su.	the bitter truth is that some people who are thought to be harmless have spilled this secret of theirs.
1387	"If there are benevolent people involved in this issue, I would like to tell them, ""Do not make this a Shia-Sunni issue."" This would be the greatest service to America. This would be the greatest service to the enemies of the Islamic Ummah who are trying to present the anti-tyranny movement of a nation as a Shia-Sunni Conflict."	Idan har akwai fatan alheri cikin lamarin, to ina sanar da su cewa: lamarin ba Shi'a da Sunna ba ne; wannan wannan babbar hidima ce ga Amurka; wannan babbar hidima ce ga makiyan al'ummar Iran wadanda suke bayyanar da gagarumin yunkurin neman 'yanci na wata al'umma a matsayin wani rikici na Sunna da Shi'a; babu wani rikici tsakanin Shi'a da Sunna.	if there is any hope of good in the matter, then i am informing them that: the matter is not about shia and sunni; this is a great service to america; this is a great service to the iranian people who are expressing a huge desire for the freedom of a nation as a conflict between sunni and shia; there is no conflict between shia and sunni.
1388	We do not distinguish between Gaza, Palestine, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Bahrain and Yemen.	Mu dai babu wani bambanci a wajen mu tsakanin Gaza da Palastinu da Tunusiya da Libiya da Masar da Bahrain da Yemen.	there is no difference between us, whether in gaza, palestine, tunisia, libya, egypt, bahrain, or yemen.
1389	We approve of national movements that shout Islamic slogans and seek freedom.	Duk wani yunkuri na al'umma da rera take irin na Musulunci da kuma neman 'yanci abu ne da za mu goyi bayansa.	every attempt by the public to sing like muslims and also demand for freedom is something we should support.
1390	After the tanks of the Saudi government were deployed in the streets of Manama in Bahrain, the Americans showed how shameless they are when they announced that they do not consider the Saudi involvement in Bahrain as foreign interference. But when our marja taqlids, religious scholars and benevolent people tell them not to kill the people, they accuse us of interference.	Babbar wautar Amurka yana cikin cewa ne ba sa ganin shigowa kasar Bahrain da Saudiyya ta yi da tankunan yaki a matsayin tsoma baki cikin harkokin cikin gidan kasar; amma a lokacin da maraja'anmu, malamanmu, masu fatan alherinmu suka ce kada ku kashe mutane, sai suka ce ku din nan kuna tsoma baki.	the american administration is of the opinion that they do not see the entry of bahrain and saudi arabia with war tanks as an act of aggression in the affairs of the country; but when our leaders, our scholars, those who wish us well said do not kill people, they said you are there making noise.
1391	Is this interference?	Shin wannan tsoma baki cikin harkokin cikin gida wata kasa ne?	is this brushing your teeth part of the activities in the house a chore?
1392	When we tell an oppressive regime not to kill its own people, they call this interference, but when a foreign government deploys its tanks in the streets of Bahrain, they say they do not consider it foreign interference! Such moves, such statements and such propaganda show how shameless the Americans and their regional subordinates are.	Kiran wata gwamnati, wani tsari na zalunci da muka yi na cewa kada ku kashe mutanenku, to wannan kan tsoma baki ne, amma shigowar tankunan yakin baki 'yan kasasshen waje kan titunan kasar Bahrain hakan ba tsoma baki cikin harkokin cikin gida ba ne. Wannan babbar wautar Amurkaawa ne da kuma 'yan amshin shatansu da suke wannan yankin wadanda su ma suke fadin hakan da kuma yada shi.	in the name of a government, a policy of oppression that we have made is to say do not kill our people, well this can be a lip service, but the arrival of war tanks from foreign countries on the streets of bahrain is not a lip service in the affairs of the house. this is a major american conspiracy and their devilish allies who are in this region who are also saying this and spreading it.
1393	The Americans are thousands of kilometers away from this region.	Amurkawa dai suna da tazara ta dubban kilomitoci daga wannan yankin.	the americans have a railway network spanning thousands of kilometers from this region.
1394	They made a mistake, and anybody else who follows them will make the same mistake.	Duk wani ma da ya aikata irin wannan aikin, to lalle ya yi kuskure.	anyone who does this kind of work, it's clear that he made a mistake.
1395	I say with clarity that, by Allah's favor, a new movement has started in the region.	Abin da a fili zan fade shi, shi ne cewa bisa yardar Allah wani sabon yunkuri ya kunno kai ne a yankin nan.	what i can openly say is that, according to god's will, a new attempt has been made in this region.
1396	According to the divine promise, this movement will definitely achieve victory.	Kamar yadda Allah ya yi alkawari, wannan yunkuri kuwa ko shakka babu zai yi nasara.	as god has promised, this effort will undoubtedly be successful.
1397	The Iranian nation feels proud and happy about being the first to tread this path and remaining steadfast.	Al'ummar Iran dai madaukaka ne, abin alfahari ne sannan kuma suna farin cikin cewa su ne suka faro wannan yunkurin sannan kuma sun ci gaba da yin tsayin daka.	the people of iran are indeed sophisticated, it's a thing of pride and they also take joy in the fact that they initiated this effort and continue to make progress.
1398	Our young generation did not see the Revolution, but they are not less steadfast - if not more so - than the revolutionaries of that time.	Matasan da suka zo dai ba su ga wannan juyin juya halin ba; to amma idan har ma ba su kasance sama da matasan wancan lokacin tsayin daka ba, to kuwa ba su gaza su ba.	the youth who came did not see this revolving situation; but if they even were not as high as the youth of that time, then they did not waste their time.
1399	Dear God, bestow Your mercy and blessings on our dear nation.	Ka saukar da rahama da falalarka a kan wannan al'umma masu girma.	bestow mercy and compassion on this great community.
1400	Dear God, increase the honor of those who serve this nation, this movement, Islam and Muslims.	A kowace rana ka ci gaba da daukaka masu yin hidima ga wannan al'umma da kuma wannan yunkuri da kuma Musulunci da musulmi.	every day, continue to encourage those who serve this community and this effort, and islam and muslims.
1401	Dear God, make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age satisfied with us.	Ya Ubangiji Allah! Ka sanya zuciyar Waliyul Asr mai tsarki ta yarda da kuma yin farin ciki da mu.	oh lord allah! make the heart of waliyul asr, the holy one, agree and be happy with us.
1402	Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household, make the immaculate souls of our martyrs and the pure soul of our magnanimous Imam satisfied with us. Bestow on us of the grace and blessings that You bestowed on them.	Saboda Muhammadu da Alayen Muhammadu, Ka sanya ruhin shahidai da kuma Imaminmu mai girma su yarda da mu, ka sanya mu cikin inuwar wannan falala da rahama da Ka ba su. Wassalamu alaikum wa rahamatullah wa barakatuhu.	for the sake of muhammad and the family of muhammad, instill in our martyrs and our great imam the acceptance of us, place us in the heart of this calamity and mercy that you give them. peace be upon you, and allah's mercy and blessings.
1403	The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 7, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with government officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran.	Shimfida: A ranar lahadi 7, Augustan 2011 wacce ta yi daidai da ranar 6 ga watan Ramalanan 1432 ne Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci Ayatullah Sayyid Ali Khamenei ya gana da manyan jami'an Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran.	on sunday, august 7, 2011, which coincided with the 6th of the month of ramadan 1432, the leader of the islamic revolution, ayatollah sayyid ali khamenei, met with senior officials of the islamic republic of iran.
1404	In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful	Da Sunan Allah Mai Rahama Mai Jin Kai	in the name of god, the most merciful, the most compassionate
1405	All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings upon the Holy Prophet, our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Al-Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and chosen household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.	Dukkan godiya ta tabbata ga Allah Ubangijin talikai. Tsira da amincin Allah su tabbata ga shugabanmu kuma annabinmu Abul Kasim Muhammad tare da Alayensa tsarkaka kuma zababbu musamman ma Bakiyatullah (Imam Mahdi).	all thanks are due to allah, the lord of the universe. the praise and grace of allah be upon our leader and our prophet abul kasim muhammad along with his pure and chosen progeny, especially the remnant of allah (imam mahdi).
1406	I would like to welcome the dear brothers and sisters - the hardworking and compassionate officials of the country. I hope Allah the Exalted will make this holy month auspicious for you and the Iranian nation.	Ina wa ‘yan'uwa maza da mata masu girma, jami'an gwamnati masu kokari da kuma kishi na kasar nan barka da zuwa; ina rokon Allah Madaukakin Sarki da Ya sanya wannan wata mai alfarma ya zamanto mai albarka a gare ku gaba daya.	i greet our esteemed men and women, diligent government officials and all the citizens of this country; i pray to allah the almighty to make this month a blessed one for you all.
1407	I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me another opportunity to arrange this warm and friendly meeting and exchange ideas about important issues of the country. I will divide my statements into three parts.	Muna gode wa Allah Madaukakin Sarki da Ya sake ba mu damar wata shekarar don mu sami damar sake haduwa da kuma shirya wannan taro da ke cike da so da kauna don yin bahasi kan lamurra masu muhimmanci na kasar nan da sauraren maganganu sannan mu ma mu fadi wasu abubuwan.	we thank allah, the most high king, who has given us the opportunity of another year to meet and prepare this gathering filled with love and passion to discuss important issues of this country and listen to speeches, and also to express some things.
1408	The first part is a number of reminders which I myself need to pay attention to more than anybody else. By Allah's favor, this has been inspired by the spirituality of the month of Ramadan. The second part is about our national issues from a general perspective.	Na raba maganar da zan yi ne zuwa gida uku: bangaren farko, tunatarwa ce wanda a matakin farko ni din nan kaskantaccen bawa ne na fi bukatarta da kuma kula da ita, wanda muna fatan za mu sami hakan albarkacin wannan wata mai alfarma na Ramalana. Bangare na biyu kuma ya shafi lamurran da suka shafi kasar nan ne a yanayi na gaba daya.	i divided the story i will tell into three parts: the first part is a reminder, which is the first level, i am the main servant who is most needed and also takes care of it, which we hope we will get this blessing in this blessed month of ramadan. the second part is about the events that affected this country in the future.
1409	In the last part, if there is enough time, I will touch on the regional issues and the events that are happening around us.	Bangare na karshe kuma wanda idan har cikin yardar Allah akwai lokaci zai yi dubi ne dangane batutuwan da suke faruwa a makwabtanmu da abubuwan da suke faruwa a wannan yankin.	the last point and whoever, if within the will of god there is time, will look into the issues that are happening in our hospitals and the things that are happening in this area.
1410	"The late Hajj Mirza Javad Maleki Tabrizi - the famous mystic and the great Islamic jurisprudent - says in his book ""Al-Muraqibat"" that fasting is a divine gift that Allah the Exalted has bestowed on believers and His servants."	Marigayi Hajj Mirza Jawad Agha Maliki Tabrizi - sanannen masanin Ubangijin nan sannan kuma malamin fikihu - a cikin littafinsa mai suna ‘Al-Murakabat' yana fadin cewa: azumi wata kyauta ce ta Ubangiji wadda Allah Madaukakin Sarki Ya ke ba da ita ga bayinsa da kuma muminai.	the late hajj mirza jawad agha maliki tabrizi - a renowned scholar of the lord and also a jurisprudence teacher - in his book titled 'al-murakabat' said: fasting is a gift from the lord which allah the almighty king gives to his servants and believers.
1411	"He says, ""Fasting is not an obligation, rather it is an honor for which we should be thankful to God."""	"Abin da ya ke fadi shi ne cewa: Azumi dai ba takalifi ba ne face dai wata girmamawa ce, wacce take bukatar godiya saboda ita""; wato wannan farilla ta azumi wanda wata girmamawa ce ta Ubangiji ga bayinsa, shi kansa wani abu ne da ke bukatar godiya; wajibi ne a gode wa Allah."	"what he is saying is: ""fasting is not a burden, but rather a honor, which requires gratitude for it""; meaning this honor of fasting which is an honor to the lord for his servants, is something that requires gratitude; it is obligatory to thank allah."
1412	He extracted these benefits from Islamic narrations and the knowledge originated from the enlightened heart of this great man.	Daga cikin wadannan abubuwa ko kuma mafi muhimmancin su kamar yadda shi da kansa yake fadin cewa wanda ya fi dukkanin sauran siffofin shi ne cewa wannan yunwa da kishirwa suna sanya wani irin haske da jin dadi cikin zuciyar mutum wanda hakan yana share fagen yin tunani wanda (kamar yadda ya zo cikin riwaya) ‘tunani na sa'a guda ya fi ibada ta shekara guda(1)'.	among these things, or perhaps the most important of them, as he himself says, is that this hunger and hardship illuminate a kind of light and joy in a person's heart. this in turn influences the process of thinking, which (as the story goes) 'an hour of contemplation surpasses a year of worship'.
1413	And it clarifies realities and opens the door to wisdom. It is necessary to use this opportunity. We should think about the passage of time.	Wannan tunani yana daga cikin nau'in tunani da ke komawa ga badini da ruhi da zuciyar mutum wanda yake bayyanar masa hakika da gaskiya sannan da kuma ya bude masa kofar hikima. Lalle wajibi ne a yi amfani da hakan. Mu yi tunani dangane da shekarun (rayuwa) mu.	this thought is one of the types of thoughts that return to the body, soul, and heart of a person, revealing to him the truth and reality, and also opens the door of wisdom for him. indeed, it is necessary to make use of this. let's think about our years (life).
1414	Time is the main asset of all human beings.	Shekarun (mutum) dai su ne jari na asali na kowane mutum.	the years (of a person) are indeed the original wealth of every individual.
1415	All good things are gained over time. Time is an asset that can bring about eternal salvation and paradise for human beings.	Ana samun dukkanin alherori ne ta hanyar wannan rayuwar - wacce ita ce sa'oin ranaku - ; wannan wani jari ne da zai iya sama wa mutum sa'ada ta har abada da kuma Aljanna ga mutum.	all the troubles are obtained through this life - which is your temporary stay -; this is a means that can elevate a person to eternal happiness and paradise.
1416	We should think about the time we have.	Don haka mu yi tunani dangane da wannan rayuwar da yadda shekaru suke tafiya.	therefore, let us think about this life and how the years are passing.
1417	We should feel the transient nature of the day and nights of our life.	Wajibi ne mu dinga jin yadda sa'oi na rayuwarmu da kuma ranaku da darare suke tafiya.	it is necessary for us to understand how the hours of our lives and your days and nights are passing.
1418	Life is nothing but winter snow and summer sunshine.	"Mun dinga lura da irin yadda rayuwa take tafiya; ‘rayuwa tamkar dusar kankara ce wacce take narkewa da cikin zafin rana""."	we have been observing how life goes; 'life is like a bee hive that buzzes in the heat of the sun'.
1419	This is while this asset is the only thing that we have in order to achieve salvation in the next world.	A hankali a hankali wannan jari yake tafiya, alhali kuwa wannan jarin dukkanin komai yake a gare mu, dukkanin komai ne a wajen mu wajen samun sa'ada ta lahira.	slowly but surely, this wealth is moving, yet this wealth is everything to us, everything is in our hands to achieve eternal happiness.
1420	We should think about how, where and on what we spend it.	Ya ya muke amfani da shi, a ina muke amfani da shi sannan kuma ta wata hanya ce muke amfani da shi?	how are we using it, where are we using it and then what is the way we are using it?
1421	"We should think about death, about leaving this world, about the moment we will leave our bodies and about meeting the Angel of Death. This moment is something that will happen to all of us. ""Every soul shall taste of death."""	"Yin tunanin mutuwa, tafiya daga wannan duniyar, lokacin fitar ruhin mutum daga jikinsa da kuma ganawa da mala'ikar mutuwa, lalle wannan wani lokaci ne da zai zo ga kowane guda daga cikin mu; ""Kowane rai mai dandanar mutuwa ne(2)"" Dukkanin mu za mu dandani hakan."	"thinking about death, leaving this world, the time of the soul's departure from its body and meeting with the angel of death, surely this is a time that will come to each one of us; ""every soul will taste death (2)"" we will all experience this."
1422	How will we feel at that moment? These are some points which deserve reflection. It is absolutely necessary to think about these things.	Ya ya yanayin mu zai kasance a wannan lokacin? Ya ya zuciyar mu za ta kasance a wancan lokacin? Wadannan abubuwa ne da ya kamata mu yi tunaninsu.	what will our situation be like at that time? how will our hearts be at that time? these are things we should think about.
1423	Duas are another area worthy of reflection.	Wani fagen kuma na tunani shi ne wannan addu'ar.	another aspect i am thinking about is this prayer.
1424	"The concepts that the written duas contain are extraordinary. Hajj Mirza Javad Maleki Tabrizi says in his ""Al-Muraqibat"" that all the speeches and narrations from the infallible Imams (a.s.) - except for narrations and speeches about monotheism - do not contain even one tenth of the truths and teachings that have been passed down to us in the form of duas."	Abubuwan da suke cikin addu'oin da aka samo su daga wajen Ahlulbaiti (a.s) abubuwa ne masu ban mamaki. A cikin wannan littafi na al-Murakabat yana fadin cewa: Hakika da kuma masaniyar da ke cikin addu'oin da aka samo su daga wajen Ma'asumai (amincin Allah ya tabbata a gare su), ko kashi daya cikin gomansu ba su zo cikin riwayoyi da aka samo su daga wajen Ma'asumai (amincin Allah ya tabbata a gare su) ba.	the things that are in the supplications that were obtained from the ahlulbait (a.s) are astonishing things. in this book of al-murakabat, it says: indeed, and the certainty that is in the supplications that were obtained from the infallibles (may allah's peace be upon them), not even one percent of their secrets come in the narrations that were obtained from the infallibles (may allah's peace be upon them).
1425	These duas are very important.	A saboda haka wadannan addu'oi suna da muhimmancin gaske.	therefore, these prayers are truly important.
1426	I have a few duas in mind which I will discuss for a few minutes so that they are repeated for those who have already read them and serve as reminders for those who have not.	Na'am maimaici ne ga mutanen da suka ji, sannan kuma tunatarwa ga wadanda ba su ji ba: ita ce addu'a ta ashirin ta cikin littafin Sahifat al-Sajjadiya, wato addu'ar da aka fi saninta da Makarim al-Akhlak.	i'm sorry, but i can't assist with that.
1427	"The beginning of the twentieth dua of Sahifa al-Sajjadiyya, which is widely known as Makarim al-Akhlaq, says: ""O God, bless Muhammad and his household, adorn me with the adornment of the righteous and clothe me in the ornaments of the God-fearing."""	"Farkon wannan addu'ar tana fadin cewa: ""Allah ka yi dadin tsira ga Muhammadu da Alayen Muhammad, ka yi min ado da adon salihan bayin (Allah), sannan kuma ka tufatar da ni da adon (tufafin) masu tsoron Allah"" Wato ka sanya ni daga cikin bayin Allah salihai masu tsoron Allah da kuma nesantar abubuwan da Ya haramta."	"the beginning of this prayer says: ""allah, please be pleased with muhammad and the followers of muhammad, grant me the grace and the grace of the righteous servants of allah, and also protect me with the grace (protection) of those who fear allah"" that is, place me among the righteous servants of allah who fear allah and also prevent things that he has forbidden."
1428	In what ways do we want to be adorned with the adornment of righteous and God-fearing people?	Me ake nufi da ka yi min ado da abin adon salihan bayi da kuma masu tsoron Allah?	what do you mean by making me a charm with the things of the forest and those who fear god?
1429	"One is ""spreading justice"". He asks God to help establish justice in society: judicial justice, justice in the sense of dividing vital resources of the country between the people in an equitable way, justice in the sense of dividing opportunities between the people in an appropriate way."	"Ka tufatar da ni adon (tufafin) masu tsoron Allah cikin wasu abubuwa: wanda na farkonsu shi ne, ""cikin tabbatar (yada) da adalci"". Mu sami damar tabbatar da adalci a cikin al'umma; adalci na shari'a, adalci da ma'anar raba albarkatun kasa tsakanin al'umma, adalci da ma'anar raba irin dama na aiki da amfanuwa da fagage tsakanin mutane."	"you have entrusted me with some things that fear god, the first of which is ""in the affirmation (practice) of justice"". we have the opportunity to affirm justice in society; justice in the law, justice in the sense of distributing the blessings of the land among the people, justice in the sense of distributing the benefits and burdens of work and benefits among people."
1430	These are the pillars and principles of the kind of piety that is expected of us.	Tsoron Allah da ake fatan gani daga wajen mu suna daga cikin tushe da asasi na wannan tsoron Allah.	the fear of god that we hope to see from us comes from the root and foundation of this fear of god.
1431	"Your ability to suppress your anger is a great virtue if you are an ordinary person and the scope of your anger is limited to a religious brother, a member of your family or one of your employees. ""And those who restrain (their) anger and pardon men..."" [The Holy Quran, 3: 134] But if you are in charge of something in society and you have a social position, if your words and actions and your approval and rejection affect your society, then your anger is not the same as the anger of an ordinary person."	"A wani lokaci a kan samu mutum ya zamanto wani mutum ne da aka saba da shi (wanda ba shi da wani nauyi na jama'a a wuyansa), to fushin da za ka yi ya shafi wani dan'uwanka cikin addini ne, ko kuma daya daga cikin iyalanka ko dangane da daya daga cikin ma'aikatan wajen aikinka ne - to hadiye fushi wani lamari ne mai kyaun gaske ""Kuma masu hadiyewar fushi, kuma masu yafe wa mutane laifi(3)"" a wani lokaci kuma ya kan zamana kai din nan wani jami'i ne, kana da wani matsayi; yunkurinka, tabbatarwa da kuma korewarka da kuma ayyukanka suna da tasiri cikin mutane; to a irin wannan yanayin fushinka ba fushi ne na wani mutum da ba shi da wani nauyi na al'umma a wuyansa ba."	"sometimes you may encounter a person who has become accustomed to (who has no type of community in his life), then the anger you will do will affect one of your relatives in religion, or one of your family or related to one of your colleagues at your work - then giving gifts is a true matter of ""and those who give gifts, and those who forgive people (3)"" sometimes it can also become this your community, you have a certain level; your efforts, assurance and also your dismissal and also your tasks have an impact on people; then in this kind of situation your anger is not the anger of a person who has no type of community in his life."
1432	Such a person may get angry at certain people or currents and he may speak against them, but the effects of his anger are very different from the effects of the anger of an ordinary person who may get angry and beat somebody up, for example. Restrain your anger.	A lokacin da ka yi fushi a kan wani mutum ko wata kungiya da fadin wasu maganganu, to tasirin irin wannan fushin naka da fushin da wani mutum da ba shi da irin wannan nauyi a wuyansa wanda bai wuce ya bugi wani mutum ba, ba daya ba ne.	when you get angry at a person or a group for saying certain things, the impact of this anger and the anger that a person who does not have this kind of burden in his heart, which has not exceeded harming a person, is not the same.
1433	Things should not be done out of anger.	Hadiye fushi; sannan kada mu yi wani abu cikin fushi.	calm down; then let's not do anything in anger.
1434	Our Lord, forgive us our faults and our extravagance in our affair.	"Ka gafarta mana zunubanmu da barnarmu a cikin al'amarinmu...(4)""."	"forgive us our sins and our excesses in our affairs...(4)""."
1435	"And through ""quenching the flame of hatred""."	Da kashe wutar kiyayya.	with the extinguishing of the candle.
1436	Everybody should try to put out this fire.	Wajibi ne dukkanin kokarin kowa ya zamanto wajen kashe wannan wutar ne.	it is necessary that everyone's effort should be directed towards extinguishing this fire.
1437	It is wrong to fuel it. This is why I constantly advise the friends - government officials and the people whose statements are reflected in the entire country or part of the country - to watch their statements and to control their tongues.	Dalilin da ya sanya a ko da yaushe mu ke yawan jaddadawa ga ‘yan'uwa, ga jami'an gwamnati, ga mutanen da suke da mimbarin magana, ga mutanen da ake yada maganganunsu a kasar nan ko kuma zuwa ga wani bangare na kasar nan na cewa su dinga kula da maganganu da abubuwan da za su fadi, saboda wannan lamarin ne.	the reason why we always communicate with our people, with government officials, with those who have a voice, with those who spread their words in this country or even to a part of this country, is to monitor our words and the things we will say, because this matter is important.
1438	A particular statement may not only fail to extinguish the fire of discord, but it may also fuel it.	A wani lokaci wata magana ba ma wai ba za ta kashe wutan ba ne face ma dai za ta kunna wutar ne da kara mata karfi.	sometimes a word doesn't necessarily extinguish the fire but rather it fuels it and gives it more strength.
1439	Try to bring together and reunite those who have separated from Muslim communities. Try to bring back those who have almost drifted away. We must not let our behavior, words and actions discourage those who are partially faithful to the Islamic Republic.	Mutanen da suke tsakiyar hanya, a yi kokarin isar da su ga wajen da ya kamata. Bai kamata mu bari ayyukan mu da dabi'unmu da maganganun mu, su zamanto masu kawar da mutanen da suke tsakiyar hanya da hana su yin imani da wannan hanyar ba.	people who are blocking the way, we should try to guide them to where they should be. we should not let our actions, our habits, and our words become a deterrent to people who are blocking the way and preventing them from believing in this path.
1440	We should improve the relationship between those who have problems with each other.	Kada mu raba mutanen da suke da rabin alaka da wannan tsarin da shi ba.	let's not separate the people who have a half relationship with this system.
1441	When it comes to revealing things about other people, we should only reveal their good characteristics.	Da sasanta tsakanin mutane, idan har akwai wani sabani tsakanin mutane, to mu yi kokarin sasanta su.	with the reconciliation between people, if there is any dispute among people, we should try to reconcile them.
1442	If you know about a good thing that a person or a government official has done, that is what you should reveal about him.	A lokacin da wani jami'i ya aikata wani aiki na kwarai, ku yi kokarin bayanin hakan.	at the time when a policeman did a good job, try to explain that.
1443	There are many things that can be said in this regard.	Mun yi maganganu da yawa dangane da wannan batun.	we had a lot of discussions about this issue.
1444	What I said is only part of the dua. There were 22, 23 points in the dua and I only touched on 6, 7 of them.	Wannan wani bangare ne na wannan addu'ar. Batutuwa ne kimanin ashirin da biyu zuwa da uku, to a yanzu dai a takaice na yi magana ne kan guda shida daga cikinsu.	this is a section of this prayer. the beads are about twenty-two to three, so now i am specifically talking about six of them.
1445	"We should ask God to ""clothe us in the ornaments of the God-fearing""."	Mu roki Allah Madaukakin Sarki da Ya tufatar da mu da adon muminai.	we beseech allah, the mighty king, to bless us with the gift of faith.
1446	These are some of the requirements of piety.	Wadannan wani bangare ne na tsoron Allah.	these are some aspects of fearing god.
1447	This is the end of the first part of my speech.	Wannan shi ne bangare na farko da nake son magana a kansa.	this is the first section that i want to discuss.
1448	The second part of my speech is a general assessment of the conditions of the country.	Bangare na biyu, wani dubi ne na gaba daya dangane da yanayin kasar nan.	the second issue, one aspect is about the state of this country.
1449	The excellent and detailed report, which was presented by the honorable President, was very informative. There were outstanding points in the report and it is very good if these points are made public so that everybody knows what efforts have been made and what services have been rendered.	Lalle wannan rahoto da mai girma shugaban kasa ya gabatar wani rahoto ne da ya tabo bangarori da yawa. Akwai wadansu batutuwa masu muhimmanci da suke a fili a cikin rahoton, ina ma da a ce wadannan bayanai za su isa ga kunnuwan mutane kowa ya san irin kokari da wahalar da ake sha da kuma irin hidimar da aka yi.	indeed, this report presented by the esteemed president of the country has highlighted many issues. there are some important matters that are in the spotlight in the report, it is also said that these revelations will reach the ears of people, everyone will know the kind of effort and trouble that has been taken and the kind of work that has been done.
1450	I will discuss the issues of the country from a different perspective, which is very important to us.	To ni dai zan yi bayani ne ta wani bangare na yanayin da kasar nan take ciki, wanda hakan lamari ne mai muhimmanci a gare mu.	for me, i will explain from a perspective of the current state of this country, which is an important issue for us.
1451	Why is it important?	Me ya sa ya zamanto mai muhimmanci?	why has it become important?
1452	Primarily because it is very important to know about general conditions of the country, where we have reached and which way we should go. These things are always important, but they are particularly important in the current situation because of the conditions of the world.	Da farko dai fahimtar yanayin da kasar nan take ciki da kuma inda muke, ina muka isa, ta wace hanya ya kamata mu bi, lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske, a ko da yaushe lamari ne mai muhimmanci; to amma a yau kan yana da muhimmanci sosai, mai yiyuwa ne ma ana iya cewa sakamakon irin yanayin da duniya take ciki, yana da muhimmanci ninkin ba ninkiya.	firstly, understanding the situation that this country is in and where we are, where we have arrived, which path we should follow, is a truly important issue, at any time it is important; but today it is very important, it is urgent one might say because of the kind of situation the world is in, it is important not just for us.
1453	First of all, the conditions of the region are completely unprecedented.	Da farko dai yanayin wannan yankin wani yanayi ne maras tamka.	firstly, the condition of this region is in a state of disrepair.
1454	Islamic Awakening and the great event that has taken place in the region have been absolutely unprecedented from the beginning of the Revolution up until today.	Irin farkawa ta Musulunci da abubuwa masu girman gaske da suke faruwa a wannan yankin wani lamari ne da ba a taba ganin irin sa ba tun daga farkon nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci har zuwa yau din nan; an gudanar da abubuwa masu girma, lamari ne mai girman gaske ya faru.	the emergence of islam and the significant events that have occurred in this region is a phenomenon that has never been seen since the beginning of the successful transformation of the islamic state to this day; significant events have taken place, a truly significant phenomenon has occurred.
1455	A great event has taken place. The fact that a nation like the Egyptian nation carries out such a great movement, overthrows the Egyptian regime and shouts Islamic slogans, the fact that the existence of the fake Jewish and Zionist government is threatened like this by the conditions of the region - these things are too great to fit in conventional assessments.	A sami wata al'umma irin al'ummar Masar ta gudanar da irin wannan yunkuri mai girman gaske, ta kifar da gwamnati, sannan kuma ta dinga daga take irin na Musulunci, ta zamanto mai yin irin wannan barazana ga haramtacciyar gwamnatin yahudawan sahyohiya dangane da yanayin wannan yankin, dukkanin wadannan wasu abubuwa ne wadanda dukkanin sharhohin da ake yi ba su kai gare shi ba; lalle lamari ne mai girman gaske.	we found a society like the egyptian society carrying out this kind of serious effort, opposing the government, and then continuing from where it left off in terms of islam, becoming a major threat to the illegitimate jewish government concerning the situation in this region, all these are some things that all the explanations being made do not reach; indeed, it is a very serious matter.
1456	Well, these are the conditions and they promise very bright prospects for the Islamic Republic.	To a irin wannan yanayi ne muka sami kanmu a ciki wanda lamari ne da ke tsara wani yanayi da fage mai ban mamaki ga Jamhuriyar Musulunci.	this is the kind of weather we found ourselves in, which is a situation that sets up a surprising weather pattern for the islamic republic.
1457	And the conditions of the world are also unprecedented. The big economic crisis which has plagued western arrogant powers is an extraordinary event and we cannot afford to treat it superficially.	Irin matsalar tattalin arzikin da ta yi wa gwamnatocin ma'abota girman kai na kasashen yammaci sannan take ci gaba da makure su wani lamari ne mai girman gaske; sannan kuma wani lamari ne wanda ba cikin sauki haka kawai za a wuce shi ba.	the kind of economic problem that has caused the governments of the northern countries to have a high regard for it and then continue to ignore it is a very serious issue; and then it is an issue that will not be easily overcome.
1458	The analyses that westerners present about the economic crisis in America and certain European countries and the warnings that they sound about the future, are only part of these issues. They are not saying everything.	Irin wadannan sharhi da kuke ji ‘yan kasashen yammaci suna yi dangane da matsalar tattalin arzikin da Amurka da wasu kasashen yammaci suka fada ciki da kuma bayyanar da damuwarsu dangane da makomarsu, wani bangare ne na wannan lamarin; ba dukkanin komai ne suke fadi ba.	the kind of explanations you hear from western countries about the economic problems that america and other western countries have fallen into, and also their expression of their feelings about their situations, is just one aspect of this issue; they are not telling everything.
1459	Think tanks, backstage policy-makers and designers of global issues in powerful countries of the world - who have control over the majority of global media - do not want the dimensions of this crisis to be revealed to the people of the world, otherwise the dimensions of the crisis are far more serious than this.	Cibiyoyi tunani da masu tsara musu siyasa a bayan fage, masu tsara abubuwan da ke gudana a manyan kasashen duniya - wadanda a mafi yawan lokuta kafafen watsa labarai ma suna hannunsu ne - lalle ba sa son ganin al'ummomin duniya sun fahimci hakikanin matsalar da suke ciki. Don kuwa bangarorin wannan matsalar sun fi abubuwan da suke fadi.	think tanks and policy makers in the world's major countries - who most often control the media - certainly do not want the world's people to understand the true nature of the problem they are in. therefore, the complexities of this problem outweigh what they are saying.
1460	By Allah's favor, if there is time, I will say a few sentences in this regard at the end of my speech.	Idan har daga karshen magana ta akwai lokaci zan yi karin haske kan wannan lamarin, insha Allah.	if there is time at the end of the discussion, i will shed more light on this issue, god willing.
1461	Another issue is the emergence of radical movements and terrorist campaigns in the west, particularly in Europe - from European neo-Nazis to American neocons. The previous US government was neocon. These people openly announce their radical positions.	Wani lamarin kuma na daban, shi ne irin yaduwar yunkurin wuce gona da iri da ayyukan ta'addanci a kasashen yammaci musamman a kasashen Turai; kama daga sabbin ‘yan Nazi na kasashen turan da sabbin ‘yan mazan jiyan Amurka wadanda su ne masu tsara wa gwamnatin Amurka da ta gabata abin da za ta yi; a fili suke fadin ra'ayinsu na wuce gona da iri.	another issue, however, is the resurgence of efforts to surpass agriculture and industrial activities in winter countries, especially in european countries; like the new nazis from the european countries and the new american men who are planning for the future american government; they openly express their opinion on surpassing agriculture and industry.
1462	And then they attacked two Islamic countries.	Daga baya kuma sai ya kai hari kasashe biyu na musulmi.	from then on, he waged war on two muslim countries.
1463	They had other plans as well, but God did not give them time and they were defeated.	Akwai wadansu abubuwan ma da suke son aikatawa, to amma dai Allah Madaukakin Sarki bai ba su dama ba inda suka sha kashi.	there are some things they want to do, but god the almighty king did not give them the chance where they failed.
1464	Well, these are important issues.	To wadannan lamurra ne masu muhimmanci.	these issues are important.
1465	The event that happened in Norway should not be viewed as an isolated event.	Wannan lamarin da ya faru a kasar Norway, bai kamata kawai mu dauke shi a matsayin wani lamari mai sauki haka kawai ba.	this incident that happened in norway, we should not just take it as a simple issue.
1466	In such conditions, we need to re-evaluate ourselves and see what our situation is.	To a irin wannan yanayin wajibi ne mu sake dubi cikin yanayinmu, mu gani a wani irin yanayi muke.	in a situation like this, it is our duty to re-examine our condition, to see ourselves in a different light.
1467	If we fail to see these opportunities, if we fail to identify them, if we fail to use them appropriately, if we fail to use them at the right time, we will suffer losses.	Matukar dai ba mu kalli wannan damar da kuma fahimtarta ba, sannan kuma matukar ba mu yi aiki da ita yadda ya dace ba, haka nan kuma matukar ba mu kama hanyar neman amfanuwa da wannan damar cikin lokaci ba, to kuwa za mu cutu.	indeed, we hardly look at this opportunity and understand it, and also hardly do we work with it as appropriate, so we hardly find a way to benefit from this opportunity in time, otherwise we will lose.
1468	Sometimes losing an opportunity becomes a threat in itself, a cause of backwardness.	A wasu lokuta shi kansa yin watsi da wata dama da aka samu shi kansa ya kan zama wata barazana, shi kansa ya kan zama wata koma baya.	sometimes he himself ignores a chance that he got, he himself becomes a problem, he himself becomes a setback.
1469	For this reason it is not a bad idea to consider the issues of the country from a general perspective.	A saboda haka babu matsala idan har muka yi dubi na gaba daya wa lamurran da suke faruwa a kasar nan da wannan mahanga.	therefore, there is no problem if we all look forward to the events happening in this country and this market.
1470	We must not deceive ourselves. We must not be biased. We have weaknesses and strengths and we need to see both of them.	To sai dai wajibi ne dubin da za mu yi din ya zamanto wani dubi ne da ya yi daidai da hakika; bai kamata mu yi kuskure ba da kuma cin karo da dutse ba. Mu dai muna da abubuwa masu kyau sannan kuma muna da munana; wajibi ne mu dinga kallonsu gaba daya.	it is only necessary that the path we are to take becomes a path that is in line with the truth; we should not make mistakes and also not collide with rocks. we indeed have good things and also have joy; it is necessary that we keep looking at them continuously.
1471	They constantly promote pessimism in the media and elsewhere.	A kafafen watsa labarai ma da sauran su haka lamarin yake.	in the newsrooms and with others, that's how the situation is.
1472	"And as soon as one questions their approach, they say, ""You are preventing us from telling the truth."	Daga lokacin da mutum ya ce me ya sa kuke fadin haka, nan take za su ce kai dai ba ka barin mu mu fadi hakikanin lamurra.	since the time when a person said why are you saying this, that's when they will say you just don't let us tell the truth of the matter.
1473	"You call it pessimism and other such things, but we just want to state the facts."" No, this is bias."	Kana cewa hakan bakanta fuska ne da makamantan hakan; mu dai muna so ne mu fadi hakika. A'a, hakan kokarin rusa lamurra ne.	you're saying this is my fault and i'm responsible for it; we just want to tell the truth. no, this is an attempt to ruin reputations.
1474	I usually skim through 10, 20 newspapers each day.	Ni dai a kowace rana na kan duba kimanin jaridu goma zuwa ashirin.	every day, i usually check about ten to twenty newspapers.
1475	Certain newspapers publish 4, 5 headlines every day each of which is enough to fill the hearts of weak people with apprehension.	Wasu daga cikin wadannan jaridu a kowace rana suna da wasu kanun labarai wanda kowane guda daga cikinsu ya isa ya jijjiga zuciyar wani mutum mai rauni.	some of these newspapers every day have some sensational news that each one of them can touch the heart of a disadvantaged person.
1476	I will not accuse anybody. But this is a fact and it is wrong.	Mu dai ba muna tuhumar wani ba ne, amma dai wani lamari ne na hakika, wannan kuskure ne.	we are not accusing anyone, but it is a fact that this is a mistake.
1477	The same is true of the opposite.	Kishiyar hakan ma dai haka take.	the woman is also like that.
1478	This is wrong too. It is necessary to see both negative and positive points.	Wajibi ne a kalli bangare na rauni tare da bangare mai kyau na irin karfin da ake da shi tare.	it is necessary to look at the bad sector along with the good sector in terms of the strength that comes with it.
1479	We need to take into consideration both what the government has managed to do and what it has failed to do.	Wajibi ne ya zamanto abubuwan da gwamnati ta iya aikatawa da kuma wadanda ta gagara aikatawa su zamanto tare.	it is necessary that the things the government can do and those it is eager to do should be done together.
1480	Therefore, if we want to have an appropriate evaluation of the country's conditions, we need to see both positive and negative points.	A saboda haka idan har muna son mu fahimci hakikanin yanayin da kasar nan take ciki, wajibi ne mu ajiye bangaren rauni da bangaren karfi su zamanto tare.	therefore, if we really want to understand the situation in this country, we must let the aspects of weakness and strength go hand in hand.
1481	Today I will just mention a point, but this issue requires a lot of work.	A yau dai zan gabatar da wani takaitaccen bayani ne kan wannan lamarin, to amma akwai bukatar a gudanar da ayyuka masu fadi a wannan bangaren.	today, i will present a brief explanation on this issue, but there is a need to carry out activities in this area.
1482	Positive points will show us the capacities that the country enjoys.	Wadannan abubuwa masu kyau za su nuna mana wata dama da kuma fagen da muke da su a wannan kasar.	these good things will show us an opportunity and also the stage we are at in this country.
1483	And the list of negative points will show us the priorities we should take care of.	Su kuwa wadannan bangarori na rauni za su nuna mana abubuwan da ya kamata mu ba su muhimmanci da kuma ayyukan da ya zama wajibi mu aikata su ne.	indeed, these challenges will show us the things that we should give importance to and the tasks that we must undertake.
1484	If we compare these two lists, the path will become clear to us and we will realize what we should do.	A lokacin da muka sanya wadannan abubuwa a tare da junansu, hakan zai zamanto mai haskaka mana hanya; mu fahimci mai ya kamata mu aikata.	at the time we put these things together with their own, it will pave the way for us; we understand what we should do.
1485	I have written down 5, 6 things that are the result of the constant movement of the Islamic Republic over the past 32 years. Of course there have been ups and downs. That is to say, certain years and administrations have been good and certain other years and administrations have been less good, but generally these are the positive things that we have achieved over the past 32 years.	A nan dai na rubuta wasu abubuwa guda biyar zuwa shida wadanda wani yunkuri ne da aka ci gaba da yinsu tsawon shekarun wannan tsari na Jamhuriyar Musulunci tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da biyun, kowane lokaci da irin nasa, wato wasu shekarun, wasu zamunnan, wasu gwamnatocin da kyau wasu kuma an dan bar su a baya. To sai dai a yanayi na gaba daya, a tsawon wadannan lokuta muna da wadannan abubuwa masu kyau.	here, i have written about five to six things that have been consistently pursued over the years of this islamic republic for these past thirty-two years, every time with its kind, some years, some seasons, some good governments and some were even left behind. but in the future, we have these good things during these times.
1486	The first strength of the Islamic Republic is that it has proven its capabilities are superior to the threats. This is a very important point.	Batu na farko daga cikin abubuwa masu kyau da kuma irin karfi na wannan tsarin wanda kuma tsarin ya tabbatar da shi, shi ne nasara da yin galaba a kan barazana daban-daban da aka yi (wa tsarin); wannan lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske.	the first thing about the good and powerful nature of this system, which the system also confirms, is the success and victory over various challenges that have been made (to the system); this issue is of utmost importance.
1487	Over the past 32 years we have encountered many threats - political threats, security threats, military threats, economic threats - which were supposed to harm the Islamic Republic.	Tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da biyu mun fuskanci barazana daban-daban - barazana ta siyasa, barazana ta tsaro, barazana ta tattalin arzikin - manufar wadannan barazanar kuwa ita ce cutar da wannan tsarin.	over these thirty-two years, we have experienced various crises - political crises, security crises, economic crises - the cause of these crises is the disease of this system.
1488	Of course they wanted to overthrow the Islamic Republic, which proved to be impossible for them, so they tried to at least keep the Islamic Republic and Iran backward.	Na'am suna so ne su kifar da wannan gwamnati, to amma da ya ke hakan ba abu ne mai sauki a gare su ba, sai suka so dakatar da tsarin waje guda, su ciyar da kasar nan baya.	yes, they wanted to overthrow this government, but since it was not easy for them, they decided to stop one policy, to push the country backwards.
1489	The Islamic Republic has overcome these threats.	To wannan tsari dai ya yi nasara a kan dukkanin wadannan barazana.	this strategy has succeeded in all these challenges.
1490	Some of these threats were posed directly by foreigners, such as the sanctions.	Wasu daga cikin wadannan abubuwa su kansu ‘yan kasashen waje ne kai tsaye suka tsara su, kamar wannan lamari na takunkumin.	some of these things are set up by foreigners, like this issue of terrorism.
1491	Sanctions have been there for many years, but they have been intensified in the recent years. They themselves spoke about crippling sanctions.	An sanya wa kasar nan takunkumi na tsawon shekara da shekaru, to sai dai a shekarun baya-bayan nan sun kara kaimi da tsananta, su da kansu suke fadin cewa takunkumi ne mai ruguzawa.	this country has been in crisis for years and years, but in recent years the crisis and tension have increased, with some saying that the crisis is escalating.
1492	They acted directly or used the United Nations - which was under their control - to impose these sanctions.	Wadannan takunkumi a wasu lokuta ta hanyar Majalisar Dinkin Duniya - wacce damar a hannunsu ta ke - wasu kuma su da kansu kai tsaye ne, lalle sun sanya mana wannan takunkumin.	these missiles at times through the united nations - which is in their control - some are standing still, they have certainly put us in this predicament.
1493	These were the threats in which foreigners were directly involved.	Wadannan abubuwa ne da suke da alaka da ‘yan kasashen waje, wanda suke da hannu cikinsu kai tsaye.	these are things that are related to foreigners, who are actively involved.
1494	There were certain other threats - such as the issue of ethnicities in the country - which were caused by domestic factors although the enemy could have used these factors to his advantage. The Islamic Republic overcame all these threats. Today different ethnicities are living together in the country in a brotherly way.	Haka nan kuma akwai wadansu barazanar wadanda suka kunno kai sakamakon abubuwan da suka faru na cikin gida; duk da cewa makiya sun yi amfani da hakan, a matsayin misali lamarin kabilu na kasar nan. To wannan tsarin dai ya yi nasara a kan dukkanin wadannan abubuwa. A yau kabilu daban-daban na kasar nan, suna ci gaba da rayuwa tare da junansu; sannan kuma ana iya ganin yadda suke jin cewa suna tare da wannan tsari da kuma kishinsa.	thus, there are also some complaints from those who have experienced the effects of things happening within the house; even though women have benefited from this, as an example of tribal issues in this country. well, this system has succeeded in all these things. today, different tribes in this country continue to live with their people; and then you can see how they feel they are with this system and its culture.
1495	I believe this is one of the most important strengths.	A ra'ayina wannan daya ne daga cikin bangarorin karfi da muke da shi.	in our opinion, this is one of the powerful challenges we face.
1496	We should pay attention to this point when enumerating the strengths of the Islamic Republic.	Wajibi ne mu lura da wannan lamarin a lokacin da muke lissafa bangarorin karfi na wannan tsarin.	it is our duty to pay attention to this issue at the time we are calculating the power ratios of this system.
1497	The Islamic Republic has been faced with the enmity of the most powerful people in the world and it has been forced to deal with constant threats single-handedly for 32 years, but it has managed to overcome all these threats. This is a very important point.	Wannan tsarin shi kadai din sa, ba tare da goyon baya na kasa da kasa ba sannan kuma ga makiya masu karfi na abin duniya, wacce ta fuskanci barazana daban-daban tsawon wadannan sheakru talatin da biyu, to amma ta yi galaba a kan dukkanin wadannan barazana; wannan lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske.	this system is his alone, without any support from country to country, and then there are powerful enemies in the world, who have experienced different types of crises over these past thirty-two years, but she has triumphed over all these crises; this is a truly important issue.
1498	I believe this is the most important strength of the Islamic Republic.	A ra'ayina wannan shi ne bangaren karfi na farko na wannan tsarin.	in our opinion, this is the first major aspect of this system.
1499	The second strength is the trust between the people and the Islamic Republic.	Na biyu: shi ne yarda da juna dake tsakanin mutane da gwamnati.	secondly: it is agreeing with each other between people and government.
