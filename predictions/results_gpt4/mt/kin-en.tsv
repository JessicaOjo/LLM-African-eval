29	They are basically going back to communities where there are a lot of other children, many of whom have suffered from consequences of war, even if they were not recruited. 	Basanzwe ahanini basubira mu baturage aho usanga hari abandi bana benshi, benshi muri bo bakaba baratewe n'ingaruka z'intambara, kabone niyo baba batinjijwe mu gisirikare.	they often return to the civilians where you find there are many other children, many of whom are affected by the consequences of war, even if they have not been enlisted in the military.

"Salim Abdool Karim, impuguke mu buzima rusange muri kaminuza ya KwaZulu-Natal, yavuze ko mu gihe hagaragaye ubwiyongere bukabije mu manza, Afurika yepfo nayo yari mu kiruhuko kandi ikizamini cyaragabanutse cyane.

308	Erdogan and the crown prince have been bitter rivals. The Turkish president led international condemnation over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul.	Erdogan n'umutware w'ikamba babaye abanywanyi bakaze.

309	The killing was linked to the crown prince, a charge he denied. But the decision earlier this month to move the Khashoggi murder trial from Istanbul to Riyadh is seen as a gesture by Ankara, opening the way for Erdogan's visit.	Ubwicanyi bwari bufitanye isano nigikomangoma, ikirego arabihakana. Ariko icyemezo cyatangiye muri uku kwezi cyo kwimura urubanza rw’ubwicanyi rwa Khashoggi kuva Istambul kugera i Riyadh gifatwa nk’ikimenyetso cya Ankara, kikaba cyarafunguye inzira y'uruzinduko rwa Erdogan.	the murder was associated with the crown prince, an accusation he denies. but the decision that began this month to resume the khashoggi murder trial from istanbul to riyadh is taken as a sign by ankara, and it has opened the path for erdogan's pilgrimage.
310	Ogutcu says with presidential elections due next year, Erdogan is looking for Saudi help to bail out the ailing Turkish economy.	Ogutcu avuga ko hamwe n'amatora ya perezida ateganijwe umwaka utaha, Erdogan arimo gushaka ubufasha bwa Arabiya Sawudite kugira ngo akize ubukungu bwa Turukiya burwaye.	the speaker says that along with the presidential elections scheduled for next year, erdogan is seeking saudi arabia's help to save turkey's ailing economy.
311	"""Turkey has an interest in reviving relations with Riyadh because Turkey needs financial support,"" said Ogutcu.

312	Shared concerns over Iran's growing influence in the region -- along with its nuclear energy program -- provide important common ground between Riyadh and Ankara, says international relations professor Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University, especially as American attention is expected to pivot away from the Middle East and toward China.	Umwarimu w’umubano mpuzamahanga, Soli Ozel wo muri kaminuza ya Kadir Has ya kaminuza ya Istanbul, avuga ko impungenge z’uko Irani igenda yiyongera muri kariya karere - hamwe na gahunda yayo y’ingufu za kirimbuzi - bitanga icyerekezo rusange hagati ya Riyadh na Ankara. Uburasirazuba bwo hagati no mu Bushinwa.	the international relations professor, soli ozel from kadir has university in istanbul, says that iran's increasing influence in the region - along with its nuclear program - provides a general direction between riyadh and ankara. the middle east between and within the west.
313	"""Turkey does propose itself as a counterweight to Iran. Both countries have an interest along with all the western countries for Iran not to be as influential throughout the region as it is today,"" said Ozel. ""And the Iranians are also constantly sending signals that they are not going to let others draw them away from those countries - Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - where they have quite a lot of influence."""	"Ozel yagize ati: ""Turukiya yiyerekana nk'ikibazo cyo guhangana na Irani. Ibihugu byombi bifite inyungu hamwe n'ibihugu byose byo mu burengerazuba bw'isi kugira ngo Irani itagira uruhare runini mu karere nk'uko bimeze ubu.""

""and the iranians also constantly send signals that they will not allow others to interfere in those countries - iraq, lebanon and syria - where they have a major role."""
314	Erdogan's Saudi visit is part of a wider policy of seeking to repair relations across the region in a bid to end its isolation. The Turkish president has recently visited the United Arab Emirates and earlier this month hosted the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog.	Uruzinduko rwa Erdogan muri Arabiya Sawudite ni imwe muri politiki yagutse yo gusana umubano mu karere kose hagamijwe guhagarika akato. Perezida wa Turukiya aherutse gusura Leta zunze ubumwe z'Abarabu kandi mu ntangiriro z'uku kwezi yakiriye perezida wa Isiraheli, Isaac Herzog.	erdogan's visit to saudi arabia is part of a broader policy aimed at strengthening relations throughout the region to prevent isolation. the turkish president recently visited the united arab emirates and at the beginning of this month, he received the israeli president, isaac herzog.
315	But analyst Ozel warns Ankara is in a vulnerable position.	Ariko umusesenguzi Ozel aragabisha Ankara ari mu bihe bigoye.	however, the messenger ozel is delivering to ankara during difficult times.
316	"""Turkey alienated, insulted, offended a lot of countries with which it had at least decent relations. And they all recognize that this burst of diplomacy is coming out of weakness rather than strength,"" said Ozel."	"Ozel yagize ati: ""Turukiya yitandukanyije, iratukwa, ibabaza ibihugu byinshi byari bifitanye nibura n'imibanire myiza. Kandi bose baremera ko uku guturika kwa diplomasi biva mu ntege nke aho gukomera."""	"ozel said: ""turkey has isolated itself, is criticized, and is a problem for many countries with which it at least had good relations. and everyone agrees that this decline in diplomacy comes from a great negligence rather than a standstill."""
317	But analysts say Ankara is banking on its importance as a potential bulwark to Iranian ambitions, a factor that may help overcome any remaining hostility among the neighbors it is trying to win back.	Ariko abasesenguzi bavuga ko Ankara ari banki ku kamaro kayo nk’igihome gikomeye cyo kwifuza kwa Irani, kikaba ari ikintu gishobora gufasha gutsinda inzangano zisigaye mu baturanyi igerageza gutsinda.	however, analysts say that ankara is a bank for its benefits as a major hub for iran's ambitions, and it could help overcome the remaining tensions in the partnership it is trying to overcome.

319	Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change.	Arabiya Sawudite irihatira kuvugurura imikorere y’ubutabera ikarishye ariko ivugurura rirengerwa n’iyicwa ndetse n’ifatwa rikomeye ry’abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi, bitera kwibaza niba byinshi bizahinduka.	saudi arabia is keen to reform its justice system, but the reform is overshadowed by executions and the severe repression of dissenters, raising questions about whether much will change.
320	The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system.	Ubwami buzwiho gusobanura byimazeyo amategeko ya shariya ya kisilamu, agize ishingiro ryubucamanza.	the kingdom is known for interpreting the complex laws of sharia islam, forming the basis of justice.
321	But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East.	Ariko mu mezi ashize yateye imbere hamwe n'ivugurura abasesenguzi bavuga ko rishobora gutuma inkiko zayo zikora nk'abandi bo mu burasirazuba bwo hagati.	however, in the past months, she has made progress along with the reform, the critics say it could make her courts work like others in the middle east.
322	That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences.	Iyo mbaraga ishingiye ku ruhererekane rw'amategeko mashya ku bibazo byoroshye nk'uburenganzira bwo gutandukana kw'abagore n'ububasha bw'abacamanza bwo kumenya ibihano.	that power is based on the transparency of new laws on simple issues such as women's right to divorce and the judges' ability to determine penalties.
323	Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image.	Byatangajwe umwaka ushize n’umutegetsi w’ikirenga, igikomangoma, Mohammed bin Salman, ingamba, harimo n’igitabo cya mbere cy’amategeko ahana, bigaragara ko zihuye n’intego ya Arabiya Sawudite yo gukingura isi no koroshya isura y’intagondwa.	it was announced last year by the supreme leader, the crown prince, mohammed bin salman, including the first book of laws, it is clear that they coincide with saudi arabia's goal of reforming the world and improving the image of the opposition.
324	Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases.	Ndetse n'abanenga bemeza ko impinduka zishobora gutuma inkiko zo muri Arabiya Sawudite zishobora guhanurwa, mu bihe bimwe na bimwe.	even skeptics agree that changes could lead to the possibility of reforming the courts in saudi arabia, sometimes.
325	But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government.	Ariko ntawiteze ko kubuza kuvuga mu bwisanzure bizoroha, cyangwa se ko amategeko azafata neza abatavuga rumwe na leta.	however, there is no guarantee that asking to speak freely will be easy, or that the laws will treat those who do not agree with the government fairly.
326	"And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to ""terrorism."""

328	Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion.

Umuntu agenga iyakirwa ryibimenyetso, mbere kubushake bwabacamanza.	two new laws have been approved by the saudi arabian government. a person manages the reception of evidence, before the judges' request.
329	The second, a family law, is to take effect in June. In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children.	Iya kabiri, amategeko yumuryango, agomba gukurikizwa muri kamena. Muri gahunda gakondo yiganjemo abagabo, yagura uburenganzira bwabagore bahukanye kubatunga no kurera abana babo.	for the second time, family laws must be followed in the community. in the traditional program that includes men, it advocates for the rights of women who have divorced to raise their children.
330	"Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented ""a major qualitative leap"" for women's rights and ""family stability."""	"Mu kwezi kwa Werurwe, igikomangoma Mohammed yatangaje iryo tegeko rishya, yavuze ko rihagarariye ""gusimbuka ubuziranenge"" ku burenganzira bw'umugore no ""gutekana mu muryango."""	"in the month of march, mohammed announced the new law, saying it represents ""overcoming backwardness"" in women's rights and ""equality in the family."""
331	The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights.	Adel al-Saeed, visi perezida w’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi ushinzwe uburenganzira bwa muntu, Adel al-Saeed yavuze ko iryo vugurura risa nkaho ryita ku masosiyete y’amahanga ashora imari mu bwami.	adel al-saeed, the vice president of the european union's human rights organization, adel al-saeed, said that this threatens international societies that invest in the kingdom.
332	"""The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Ba nyir'imari bafite ubwoba bwo gushora imari muri iki gihugu, kizwiho amategeko, bityo aya mategeko agamije guhindura isura""."	"he said: ""the investors are afraid to invest in this country, known for its laws, thus these laws aim to change the image""."
333	The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes.	Igitabo gishya cy'amategeko ahana, kitarashyirwa ahagaragara, gishobora kuzana izindi mpinduka zikomeye.	the new law book, if not made public, could bring about significant changes.
334	Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases.	Muri shariya, ubuhakanyi, ubujura, kwigomeka, ubujura bwitwaje intwaro, gusambana, kunywa inzoga no gusebanya bitwara ibihano byateganijwe. Abacamanza basigaye bagena ibihano mu zindi manza.	in this society, corruption, fraud, laziness, armed fraud, adultery, drinking beer and prostitution carry predetermined penalties. judges only impose penalties in other cases.
335	"With a penal code in place, ""the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state,"" said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University."	"Hamwe n’amategeko ahana, ""leta izateganya ko abacamanza batashingira ku mahugurwa yabo bwite muri shariya ahubwo bakurikiza amategeko (ashingiye kuri shariya) yemejwe na leta"", ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Nathan Brown, umunyeshuri muri kaminuza ya George Washington."	"together with the laws prohibiting, ""the government will ensure that judges do not base their training on their own opinions in the city, but follow the laws (based on the city) approved by the government"", this was said by nathan brown, a professor at george washington university."
336	"""As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region,"" said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms."	"Brown wize ku ivugurura rya Arabiya Sawudite yagize ati: ""Kubera iyo mpamvu, Arabiya Sawudite izasa cyane na gahunda y’amategeko mbonezamubano, kimwe na Leta nyinshi zo mu karere."""	"brown, speaking on the reform in saudi arabia, said: ""for this reason, saudi arabia will greatly benefit from the constitutional law program, along with many other countries in the region."""
337	"The result should be more ""predictability,"" said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules ""take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."""	"Ibisubizo bigomba kurushaho kuba ""guhanura"", nk'uko byavuzwe na Abdullah Alaoudh, impuguke mu by'amategeko ukomoka muri Amerika akaba anenga guverinoma, kubera ko amategeko mashya ""akuraho inzira ... abacamanza bari bafite."""	"the answers need to be more ""transparent"", as stated by abdullah alaoudh, a legal expert from america who criticizes the government, because the new laws ""remove the path ... the judges had."""
338	"But tighter regulation by the monarchy also ""creates a larger problem: lack of independence,"" he added."	"Yongeyeho ko ariko gukurikiza amategeko agenga ubwami nabyo ""bitera ikibazo kinini: kubura ubwigenge""."	"i greet you but following the laws governing the kingdom also ""causes a big problem: lack of independence""."

340	Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar.	Se wa Alaoudh, umunyamadini ukomeye Salman al-Awdah, afunzwe kuva mu 2017, bisa nkaho ari ukwihorera ku rubuga rwa Twitter ruvuguruzanya na politiki ya Arabiya Sawudite mu gihe cyo guha akato Qatar.	salman al-awdah, a prominent cleric of aloudh, has been detained since 2017, seemingly for criticizing saudi arabian politics on twitter during the time of the qatar blockade.

342	One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession.	Imwe mu ngero zikomeye ni uwahoze ari igikomangoma cy’ikamba, Mohammed bin Nayef, umufasha wa CIA wubahwa mu Burengerazuba kubera umuhate we wo kurwanya ubuhezanguni, ariko Umwami Salman yirukanye ku murongo w'izungura.	one of the serious cases is that of the former crown prince, mohammed bin nayef, a cia ally who was praised in the west for his hard line against terrorism, but king salman has sidelined him in the line of succession.
343	Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed.

348	Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.

514	Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.

515	"""There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things,"" says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder."

516	At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.	Mu gihe cyo kuvuka, impinja zitagira kivurira zibona antibodi kuri ba nyina amashereka, abafasha kubarinda kugeza igihe bazubaka ubudahangarwa bwabo.	during breastfeeding, babies who are not vaccinated receive antibodies from their mothers' milk, which helps protect them until they build their own immunity.

520	Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.	Ndetse na mbere y’icyorezo, ibimenyetso by’ibyorezo byerekanaga ko abana bo mu bihugu byateye imbere cyane, aho gukaraba intoki no gukoresha isuku byiganje, bashobora kuba bafite sisitemu y’umubiri idateye imbere ugereranije n’abana bo mu bihugu bikiri mu nzira y'amajyambere bakunze guhura na bagiteri nyinshi, virusi na allergene. .	even before the onset of the pandemic, signs of the pandemic showed that children in highly developed countries, instead of playing in the dirt and using brooms, may have an underdeveloped body system compared to children in developing countries who often encounter many bacteria, viruses and allergens.

535	The Biden administration has begun expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans to Mexico under pandemic-related powers to deny migrants a chance to seek asylum, expanding use of the rule even as it publicly says it has been trying to unwind it, officials said Wednesday.	Ku wa gatatu, abayobozi bavuze ko ubuyobozi bwa Biden bwatangiye kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa muri Mexico kubera ububasha bujyanye n’icyorezo bwo kwima abimukira amahirwe yo gusaba ubuhungiro, kwagura ikoreshwa ry’iryo tegeko nubwo rivuga ku mugaragaro ko ryagerageje kubireka.	on wednesday, the leaders said that the biden administration began rejecting mexicans and nicaraguans in mexico due to the power associated with the system of denying immigrants the opportunity to seek asylum, despite publicly trying to demonstrate the use of that law.
536	The U.S. struck agreement with Mexico to expel up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans a day from three locations: San Diego; El Paso, Texas; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the effort.	Amerika yagiranye amasezerano na Mexico yo kwirukana abanya Cuba 100 na Nikaragwa 20 kumunsi ahantu hatatu: San Diego; El Paso, muri Texas; n'ikibaya cya Rio Grande, muri Texas, nk'uko byatangajwe n'umuyobozi wa Amerika ufite ubumenyi butaziguye bw'imbaraga.	america has signed an agreement with mexico to expel 100 cubans and 20 nicaraguans per day at three locations: san diego; el paso, in texas; and the rio grande valley, in texas, as announced by the american leader with unparalleled knowledge of power.
537	The expulsions began April 27 and will end May 22, the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.	Iyirukanwa ryatangiye ku ya 27 Mata rikazarangira ku ya 22 Gicurasi, nk'uko uyu muyobozi yabitangarije ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika kugira ngo atamenyekana kubera ko ayo masezerano atashyizwe ahagaragara.	the conference began on the 27th of march and will end on the 22nd of may, as this leader announced to the american press office, so as not to be identified because these agreements have not been made public.
538	They are carried out under Title 42 authority, a public health law that has been used to expel migrants on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19. Title 42 is due to expire May 23, unless a judge intervenes.	Bikorerwa munsi yumutwe wa 42, itegeko ryubuzima rusange ryakoreshejwe mu kwirukana abimukira ku mpamvu zo gukumira ikwirakwizwa rya COVID-19. Umutwe wa 42 ugomba kurangira ku ya 23 Gicurasi, keretse umucamanza abigizemo uruhare.	it is being implemented under the 42nd head, the general health law was used to deny immigrants for reasons of preventing the spread of covid-19. the 42nd head should end on may 23, unless the judge plays a role in it.
539	The U.S. and Mexico agreed April 26 to a very limited number of expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans, according to a high-level Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.	Nk’uko byatangajwe n'umuyobozi wo mu rwego rwo hejuru wo muri Megizike wavuze ko atigeze atangazwa kubera ko batemerewe kugira icyo batangaza ku mugaragaro, Amerika na Mexico byumvikanye ku ya 26 Mata ku mubare muto cyane wo kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa.	as announced by the high-ranking official in mexico, he said that he was never announced because they were not allowed to make public announcements, america and mexico agreed on the 26th of march on a very small number to expel the nicaraguans and the canadians.
540	It was prompted by higher numbers of migrants from those two countries coming to the U.S. border.	Byatewe numubare munini w’abimukira bava muri ibyo bihugu byombi baza kumupaka wa Amerika.	a large number of refugees from both countries come to the border of america.
541	Mexico also took into account that the U.S. government had started processing visas in Cuba again, the official said. Mexico had also begun processing visas for Cubans.	Uyu muyobozi yavuze ko Mexico kandi yazirikanye ko guverinoma y'Amerika yatangiye gutunganya viza muri Cuba. Mexico nayo yari yatangiye gutunganya viza kubanya Cuba.	this leader said that mexico and also pointed out that the american government has started processing visas in cuba. mexico had also started processing visas for cubans.
542	Another Mexican official, also not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans were being expelled from San Diego under Title 42.	Undi muyobozi wo muri Megizike, na we utemerewe kugira icyo atangaza ku mugaragaro, yemeje ko Abanyakanani bagera kuri 100 na Nikaragwa 20 birukanwa muri San Diego ku mutwe wa 42.	i am a leader in mexico, and he is also allowed to make a public announcement, agreed that 100 canadians and 20 nicaraguans are being deported in san diego on the 42nd.
543	The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	Minisiteri ishinzwe umutekano mu gihugu cya Amerika ntabwo yahise isubiza icyifuzo cyo gutanga ibisobanuro.	the ministry responsible for security in the united states has not yet responded to the request for clarification.
544	Until last week, Mexico only agreed to take Guatemalans, Hondurans and El Salvadorans — in addition to Mexicans — under Title 42 authority. Other nationalities are subject to Title 42 but costs, strained diplomatic ties and other considerations often make it difficult to send them back to their home countries.	Kugeza mu cyumweru gishize, Mexico yemeye gufata Guatemala, Hondurans na El Salvadorans - usibye Abanyamegizike - ku butegetsi bwa 42. Abandi benegihugu bagengwa na Umutwe wa 42 ariko ikiguzi, umubano wububanyi n’ububanyi n’ibindi bitekerezo akenshi biragoye kubasubiza mu bihugu byabo.	until last week, mexico agreed to host guatemalans, hondurans, and el salvadorans - except for south americans - under the rule of 42. other nationals are handled by the 42nd body, but the cost, relationship, and other considerations often make it difficult to return them to their countries.
545	It's next to impossible for the U.S. to expel migrants to Cuba or Nicaragua because of poor relations with those governments. 	Bikurikira ntibishoboka ko Amerika yirukana abimukira muri Cuba cyangwa Nikaragwa kubera umubano mubi na guverinoma.	it is unlikely that america will reject immigrants from cuba or nicaragua due to poor relations with the government.
546	That has posed a challenge for the Biden administration as more people from those countries seek haven in the United States.	Ibyo byateje ikibazo ubuyobozi bwa Biden mugihe abantu benshi baturuka muri ibyo bihugu bashaka ubuhungiro muri Amerika.	those issues caused a problem for biden's administration at a time when many people from those countries were seeking asylum in america.
547	Cubans were stopped by U.S. authorities more than 32,000 times on the Mexican border in March, double the number in February and more than five times October's count, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Nicaragua eased travel restrictions from Cuba in November, making it easier for Cubans to continue by land to the U.S. border. Most enter the U.S. in or near Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas.	Nk’uko byatangajwe na gasutamo ya Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, ngo abanya Cuba bahagaritswe n'abayobozi b'Abanyamerika inshuro zirenga 32.000 ku mupaka wa Mexico, bakubye kabiri muri Gashyantare ndetse bakubye inshuro zirenga eshanu Ukwakira. Nikaragwa yorohereje imbogamizi z’ingendo ziva muri Cuba mu Gushyingo, byorohereza Abanyakanada gukomeza ku butaka kugera ku mupaka wa Amerika. Benshi binjira muri Amerika cyangwa hafi ya Yuma, Arizona, na Del Rio, Texas.	as announced by the united states department of homeland security, over 32,000 cubans have been stopped by american authorities at the mexican border, including twice in february and more than five times in october. nicaragua sent travel obstacles from cuba in november, prompting canadians to continue on land to the american border. many enter america or near yuma, arizona, and del rio, texas.
548	Nicaraguans were stopped more than 16,000 times in March, more than double September's level. The vast majority enter in South Texas.	Muri Werurwe, Nikaragwa yahagaritswe inshuro zirenga 16.000, irenga inshuro ebyiri Nzeri. Umubare munini winjira muri Texas yepfo.	in march, nicaragua was hit more than 16,000 times, twice as many times as nzeri. a large number entered texas at the bottom.
549	Lifting Title 42 has proved controversial as midterm elections near, even for Biden's Democratic Party, amid concerns that the U.S. is unprepared for an anticipated increase in migrants seeking asylum. Authorities stopped migrants more than 221,000 times in March, the highest mark in 22 years.	Kuzamura Umutwe wa 42 byagaragaye ko bitavugwaho rumwe nk’amatora yo hagati, ndetse no mu ishyaka rya demokarasi rya Biden, mu gihe hari impungenge z’uko Amerika ititeguye kwiyongera kw’abimukira bashaka ubuhungiro. Muri Werurwe, abategetsi bahagaritse abimukira inshuro zirenga 221.000, kikaba aricyo kintu kinini mu myaka 22.	the rise of the 42nd head showed that there was no consensus on the elections between them, even within biden's democratic party, while there were concerns that america was not ready to increase the number of immigrants seeking asylum. in march, the authorities stopped more than 221,000 immigrants, the highest number in 22 years.
550	The White House and Homeland Security Department have publicly stood behind the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to end the measure because it could no longer be justified on grounds of protecting public health.	Ishami ry’umutekano n’umutekano mu gihugu ryashyigikiye ku mugaragaro icyemezo cy’ikigo gishinzwe kurwanya no gukumira indwara cyo guhagarika iki cyemezo kuko kitagishoboye kuba gifite ishingiro kubera kurengera ubuzima rusange.	the security department and national security publicly supported the decision of the institution responsible for combating and preventing diseases to suspend this decision because it could not be justified in terms of protecting public health.
551	But the practice of expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans runs counter to the administration's public statements that it was phasing out use of the pandemic powers to prepare for May 23.	Ariko imyitozo yo kwirukana abanya Cuba na Nikaragwa irahabanye n’ubuyobozi bwatangaje ko bwagiye bukuraho imbaraga z’icyorezo kugira ngo bitegure ku ya 23 Gicurasi.	however, the training to evacuate cubans and nicaraguans contradicts the leadership's announcement that they had reduced the strength of the curfew in preparation for may 23rd.
552	The U.S. has expelled migrants more than 1.8 million times under Title 42 authority since March 2020, effectively overriding rights to seek asylum under U.S. law and international treaty. In doing so, migrants are not subject to immigration law, which include rights to seek protection from persecution at home.	Kuva muri Werurwe 2020, Amerika yirukanye abimukira inshuro zirenga miliyoni 1.8 ku butegetsi bwa Umutwe wa 42, bivuguruza uburenganzira bwo gusaba ubuhungiro hakurikijwe amategeko ya Amerika n'amasezerano mpuzamahanga. Mu kubikora, abimukira ntibagengwa n'amategeko y’abinjira, akubiyemo uburenganzira bwo kurindwa ibitotezo mu ngo.	since april 2020, america has deported over 1.8 million immigrants under the authority of the 42nd head, violating the right to seek asylum as per american laws and international agreements. in doing so, immigrants are not protected by the laws of the host, including the right to be protected from harm in their homes.
553	The administration said in court filings that it began processing more Central American adults under immigration laws after the CDC's announcement on April 1. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that it couldn't start unwinding Title 42 while it was still in effect.	Ubuyobozi bwatangaje mu rukiko ko bwatangiye gutunganya abantu benshi bakuze bo muri Amerika yo Hagati bakurikiza amategeko y’abinjira nyuma y’uko CDC ibitangaza ku ya 1 Mata.	the leadership announced in court that it has begun processing many elderly people from central america in accordance with the immigration laws after the cdc's announcement on april 1st.
554	U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays strongly criticized the CDC's decision, suggesting he would try to keep Title 42 in effect after May 23. A hearing is scheduled May 13 for oral arguments.	Umucamanza w'akarere ka Amerika, Robert Summerhays, yanenze cyane icyemezo cya CDC, avuga ko azagerageza gukomeza Umutwe wa 42 nyuma y'itariki ya 23 Gicurasi.	the american district judge, robert summerhays, strongly criticized the cdc's decision, saying he will try to continue section 42 after may 23rd.
555	Marisa Limon, senior director of advocacy and planning at the Hope Border Institute, said advocates began learning about expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans from El Paso on Monday and later confirmed the new practice with U.S. officials.	Umuyobozi mukuru ushinzwe ubuvugizi n’igenamigambi mu kigo cya Hope Border, Marisa Limon, yavuze ko abunganizi batangiye kwiga ibijyanye no kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa muri El Paso ku wa mbere nyuma baza kwemeza imikorere mishya hamwe n’abayobozi ba Amerika.	the senior leader in charge of public relations and planning at the hope border institute, marisa limon, said that the interpreters began studying matters related to the rejection of nicaraguans and cubans in el paso on the first day after agreeing on new operations with american leaders.
556	"Limon said the administration is ""trying to get every last bit out of Title 42"" before it expires. "	"Limon yavuze ko ubuyobozi ""bugerageza gukuramo buri kintu cya nyuma mu mutwe wa 42"" kitararangira."	"limon said that the leadership ""trying to remove every last thing in the head of 42"" does not end."
557	"She called it ""sobering"" but consistent with the administration's efforts to have other countries in the Western hemisphere take more responsibility for hosting people fleeing their homes."	"Yayise ""gutekereza"" ariko ahuza n'imbaraga z'ubuyobozi kugira ngo ibindi bihugu byo mu gice cy'iburengerazuba bigire uruhare runini mu kwakira abantu bahunga ingo zabo."	"he advocated ""thinking"" but also combined it with the power of leadership so that other countries in the western hemisphere could play a major role in accepting people fleeing their homes."
558	Mexico Relocates Migrant Camp; Haitians Appear at Border	Mexico yimuye inkambi y'abimukira; Abanyahayitiya bagaragara kumupaka	mexico has moved the refugee camp; haitians are visible at the border.
559	Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have relocated a migrant camp that sprung up in a park in the border city of Reynosa, moving about 2,000 people from Central America and Haiti to a shelter in the city, across the border from McAllen, Texas.	Ku wa kabiri, abategetsi ba Mexico bavuze ko bimuye inkambi y’abimukira yavukiye muri parike iri mu mujyi wa Reynosa uhana imbibi, yimura abantu bagera ku 2000 bava muri Amerika yo Hagati na Haiti mu buhungiro mu mujyi, hakurya y’umupaka na McAllen, muri Texas.	on tuesday, mexican authorities said they had cleared a migrant camp in a park in the city of reynosa, which is notorious for crime, and moved about 2000 people from central america and haiti who had been living in the city, near the border with mcallen, texas.
560	The camp of migrants mainly from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti sprung up after U.S. officials, citing the pandemic, invoked a health rule that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum.	Inkambi y'abimukira ahanini baturutse muri Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras na Haiti imaze kuvuka nyuma yuko abayobozi ba Amerika, bavuga ko iki cyorezo, basabye itegeko ry’ubuzima ryanga abimukira amahirwe yo gusaba ubuhungiro.	the majority of the refugee camp from guatemala, el salvador, honduras and haiti has crossed after american leaders, arguing that this system, requested a health law that would give immigrants a chance to seek asylum.
561	Mexico's National Immigration Institute said the migrants were taken around midnight Monday to the shelter, which it said will have better hygiene and food services.	Ikigo cy'igihugu gishinzwe abinjira n'abasohoka muri Mexico cyatangaje ko abimukira bajyanywe mu gicuku cyo ku wa mbere bakajya mu buhungiro, buvuga ko buzagira isuku na serivisi nziza.	the national agency responsible for immigration in mexico announced that immigrants will be taken to a detention center first before being placed in asylum, stating that it will have good hygiene and excellent services.
562	But on Monday, people in another border city, Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of migrants, mainly Haitians, have streamed into that city, which is across the border from Laredo, Texas	Ariko ku wa mbere, abantu bo mu wundi mujyi uhana imbibi, Nuevo Laredo, bavuze ko abimukira babarirwa mu magana, cyane cyane Abanyahayiti, binjiye muri uwo mujyi, uhana imbibi na Laredo, muri Texas.	but on the first day, people from another city across the border, nuevo laredo, said that immigrants, especially haitians, entering that city, across the border with laredo, in texas, are stranded in the thousands.

617	The new military government promised to restore democracy to Rwanda via elections in 2003.	Guverinoma nshya y’ingabo yasezeranije kugarura demokarasi mu Rwanda binyuze mu matora yo mu 2003.	the new government of the army has committed to restoring democracy in rwanda through the 2003 elections.
618	That process began in March this year, with district elections.	Iyo nzira yatangiye muri Werurwe uyu mwaka, hamwe n’amatora y’akarere.	that path started in april this year, along with the district elections.
619	Senior analyst Francois Grignon, of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based policy research organization, says he was disappointed with the district poll. Mr. Grignon says the process was so tightly controlled that he maintains no genuine opposition candidates were allowed to stand.	Umusesenguzi mukuru Francois Grignon, wo mu itsinda mpuzamahanga rishinzwe ibibazo bya politiki iherereye i Buruseli, avuga ko yatengushye amatora y'akarere. Bwana Grignon avuga ko inzira yagenzuwe cyane ku buryo akomeza avuga ko nta bakandida nyabo batavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi bari bemerewe guhagarara.	the chief mediator, francois grignon, from the international team based in brussels dealing with political issues, says he has overseen the regional elections. mr. grignon says the process was very transparent, to the point where he continues to say that there were no candidates who did not agree with the government that were allowed to stand.
620	"""There was a screening and there was a preparation of the elections, which did not allow other candidates than those who had been rubber-stamped by the government to actually contest, especially for the executive positions within the local authorities,"" he says. ""If consensual democracy means that the political debate is actually handled before the electoral contest in such a way that it does not lead to a real competition then there is no democracy at all."""	"Agira ati: ""Habayeho isuzuma kandi hategurwa amatora, atemerera abandi bakandida uretse abashyizweho kashe na guverinoma guhatanira koko, cyane cyane ku myanya y'ubuyobozi mu nzego z'ibanze"". ""Niba demokarasi yumvikanyweho bivuze ko impaka za politiki zikemurwa mbere y'amarushanwa y'amatora ku buryo bitatuma habaho amarushanwa nyayo, nta demokarasi ihari."""

""if democracy is understood to mean that political disputes are resolved before the elections in a way that does not lead to fair elections, then there is no democracy."""
621	In a new report, titled Consensual Democracy in Post Genocide Rwanda, the International Crisis Group urges the international community to pressure Rwanda's government to liberalize political activity.	Muri raporo nshya yiswe Demokarasi ihuriweho na Jenoside nyuma y’itsembabwoko mu Rwanda, Itsinda mpuzamahanga rishinzwe ibibazo rirasaba amahanga guhatira leta y’u Rwanda kwishyira ukizana mu bikorwa bya politiki.	in the new report titled democracy and genocide after the massacres in rwanda, the international team responsible for the issues is urging the world to support the rwandan government in implementing political actions.
622	The report notes that the military dominates public life and there is little open criticism of the government, either in the media or by opposition figures. The Rwanda government argues that allowing a range of opinions would be dangerous in a country struggling to come to terms with its bloody past.	Raporo ivuga ko igisirikare cyiganje mu buzima rusange kandi ko nta kunegura guverinoma, haba mu bitangazamakuru cyangwa ku bantu batavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi. Guverinoma y'u Rwanda ivuga ko kwemerera ibitekerezo bitandukanye byaba ari akaga mu gihugu kirwanira kumvikana na kahise kayo k'amaraso.	the report states that the military has interfered in general life and that there is no criticism of the government, whether in the media or among people who disagree with the regime. the rwandan government says that allowing different opinions would be a threat in a country striving to reconcile with its bloody past.
623	But Mr. Grignon says dissent is simply being driven underground or outside Rwanda's borders.	Ariko Bwana Grignon avuga ko abatavuga rumwe na leta bayoborwa mu nsi cyangwa hanze y’umupaka w’u Rwanda.	however, mr. grignon says that those who do not agree with the government will be ruled within or outside the borders of rwanda.
624	"""Opponents to the regime have to flee the country or to join in rebel movements outside the country or in the Congo and no chance to express a different view,"" he says. ""All the good policies that the government has been implementing - including the organization of the elections, national elections, presidential and parliamentary, in 2003 - will lack the credibility because they were not implemented in an environment that actually allowed a fair contest to take place,"" he says."	"Agira ati: ""Abatavuga rumwe n'ubutegetsi bagomba guhunga igihugu cyangwa kujya mu myigaragambyo y'inyeshyamba hanze y'igihugu cyangwa muri Kongo kandi nta mahirwe yo kuvuga ukundi."" ""Politiki nziza zose guverinoma yashyize mu bikorwa - harimo gutegura amatora, amatora y’igihugu, perezida ndetse n’inteko ishinga amategeko, mu 2003 - ntizizigirirwa icyizere kuko zitashyizwe mu bikorwa byemerera amarushanwa akwiye. , ""."	"he said: ""those who do not agree with the government should either flee the country or go to the guerrilla camps outside the country or in congo, and there is no chance to speak otherwise."" ""all the good policies that the government has implemented - including preparing elections, national elections, the president and even the legislative assembly, in 2003 - are not trusted because they were not implemented in a competitive manner."""
625	Mr. Grignon says greater freedom of expression would strengthen Rwanda's reconciliation process and enhance its chances of a peaceful future.	Bwana Grignon avuga ko ubwisanzure mu gutanga ibitekerezo bwashimangira inzira y'ubwiyunge y'u Rwanda kandi bikongerera amahirwe y'ejo hazaza.	mr. grignon says that freedom of expression has paved the way for rwanda's reconciliation and it increases the chances for a better future.
626	He says the international community's involvement in reconstruction projects gives it the leverage to make this plain to the Rwandan government.

627	Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2015	Abahanga mu bukungu bavuze ku muhanda wa Bumpy mu bukungu bwa Malawi muri 2015	economists spoke about the bumpy road in the economy of malawi in 2015.
628	Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate. More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested.	Abashinzwe ubukungu muri Malawi bavuga ko iki gihugu gishobora gukomeza guhura n’ibibazo by’amafaranga mu mwaka wa 2015 keretse guverinoma ishobora kugarura ikizere cy’abaterankunga, bakaba bakomeje guhagarika 40% by’ingengo y’imari kubera ikibazo cya ruswa kizwi ku izina rya Cashgate. Amadolari arenga miliyoni 30 yasahuwe mu isanduku ya leta muri ayo mahano, maze abantu benshi barimo n'abayobozi ba leta barafatwa.	the economic authorities in malawi say that the country may continue to face financial problems in 2015 unless the government can restore the confidence of donors, who continue to withhold 40% of the budget due to the corruption scandal known as cashgate. over 30 million dollars were stolen from the state coffers in this scandal, leading to the arrest of many people, including government officials.
629	The withholding of donor aid has forced Malawi's government to pass what is known as the Zero Aid national budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year. Analysts, such as Abel Mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy.	Guhagarika imfashanyo z'abaterankunga byatumye leta ya Malawi itora icyitwa ingengo y’imari ya Zero Aid mu mwaka w'ingengo y'imari wa 2014-2015. Abasesenguzi nka Abel Mwanyungwe, umwarimu w’ubukungu muri kaminuza ya Polytechnic ya kaminuza ya Malawi, bavuga ko igabanuka ry’amafaranga ryangije ubukungu.	the suspension of donor aid led malawi to adopt a zero aid budget in the fiscal year 2014-2015. analysts like abel mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at malawi's polytechnic university, say the financial disruption has ruined the economy.
630	"""This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance. We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals. In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time,"" said Mwanyungwe."	Uyu ni umwaka utoroshye kuko tuvuye mu ngaruka za Cashgate zifite uruhare runini mu mikorere y'ubukungu. Twabonye ko akenshi usanga amashami yoroheje kandi akomeye ndetse n'abatanga serivisi byagize ingaruka, mu buryo bw'uko ntabwo dufite ibiyobyabwenge bihagije mu bitaro. Mu mashuri, mu bijyanye no kwishyura abarimu ntabwo ari igihe , Mwanyungwe.	this is a difficult year because we are coming from the effects of cashgate which had a significant role in the economy. we have seen that often you find that the sectors have deteriorated and are strong, even the service providers have had an impact, in a way that we do not have enough intellectual resources in the hospitals. in schools, in terms of paying teachers, it is not time, mwanyungwe.
631	Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay.	Mwanyungwe ahuza kandi Cashgate no guta agaciro kw'ifaranga rya Malawis, kwacha, bikaba byaratumye imyigaragambyo y'abakozi ba leta basaba umushahara munini.	mwanyungwe unites and the cashgate and the devaluation of the malawian kwacha, which led to government workers protesting for higher wages.
632	For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money.	Kurugero, abakozi bunganira ubucamanza bamaze ibyumweru bitandatu bigaragambyaga, basaba kongererwa umushahara 45% leta ivuga ko idashobora kwishyura kuko idafite amafaranga.	for example, the judiciary workers who have been on strike for six weeks, are asking for a 45% salary increase but the government says it cannot afford it because it does not have the money.
633	Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return.	Abakozi bo mu biro bishinzwe kurwanya ruswa muri Malawi bagiye mu myigaragambyo basaba kongererwa umushahara 70% kugeza igihe leta ibangamiye ko bazabura umushahara wabo mu Kuboza nibataha.	the employees of the offices responsible for fighting corruption in malawi are going on strike, demanding a 70% salary increase until the government threatens to withhold their salaries in december if they do not stop.
634	Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances.	Mwanyungwe yavuze ko guverinoma ishobora kwirinda gusa imyigaragambyo mu 2015 mu gihe ishyira ingufu mu kugarura icyizere cy'abaterankunga mu micungire y’imari ya Leta.	mwanyungwe said that the government could only avoid protests in 2015 if it puts effort into restoring the confidence of investors in the government's financial management.
635	"""My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, we may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation,"" said Mwanyungwe."	Ubwoba bwanjye ni uko niba tudafite iki cyizere cy'abaterankunga ndetse n'inkunga y'abaterankunga igaruka mu bukungu, dushobora guhatira guverinoma kujya mu nguzanyo zikomeye zaho byavamo ingaruka zikomeye ku bijyanye n'ifaranga, ku bijyanye n'inyungu n'ibi hashobora kugira uburyo bwo gufata-gutakaza ibintu , Mwanyungwe.	my fear is that if we do not have this confidence in investors and the support of investors in the economy, we may force the government into heavy debts which could have serious consequences on the currency, on profits and this could lead to a way of seizing-wasting things, mwanyungwe.
636	The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system.	Abaterankunga, mu bindi, basaba ko leta yakurikirana abantu bose bagize uruhare muri ayo mahano no gushimangira gahunda y’imicungire y’imari.	the protesters, among other things, are calling for the government to track all those involved in these atrocities and to enforce the money laundering program.
637	"Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered 2014 as ""a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector."""	"Newton Kambala, perezida w’ishyirahamwe ry’ubucuruzi n’inganda muri Malawi, yavuze ko aya mahano yatumye umwaka wa 2014 uba ""umwaka mubi cyane ku bucuruzi, kubera imyenda nini leta ibereyemo abikorera."""	"newton kambala, the president of the business and industry association in malawi, said that these conflicts made 2014 a ""very bad year for business, due to the heavy taxes the government imposed on operators."""
638	"He warned that if the situation persists, ""2015 will be worse."""	"Yagabishije ko nibikomeza, ""2015 bizaba bibi."""	"he warned that if it continues, ""2015 will be bad."""
639	In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal.	Ku wa gatandatu ushize, muri leta y’igihugu cye, Peter Mutharika, yavuze ko guverinoma ye ikora ibishoboka byose kugira ngo ikemure ibibazo byatewe n’urukozasoni rwa Cashgate.	on the past saturday, in his country's state, peter mutharika said that his government is doing everything possible to solve the problems caused by the cashgate scandal.

We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible,"" said Mutharika."	Guverinoma yanjye yashimangiye gahunda y’imari kugira ngo Cashgate itazongera kubaho muri Malawi.

641	Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013.

642	Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing	Malawi gukora Ikizamini cya virusi itera sida ku muryango	malawi to conduct an aids virus test on the family.
643	Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year. Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily. Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga.	Abanya Malawiya batanze ibitekerezo kuri gahunda za leta zo kwipimisha ku nzu n'inzu mu ntangiriro z'umwaka utaha.

Minisitiri w’ubuzima Jean Kalirani yatangaje gahunda mu gihe cyo kwibuka umunsi mpuzamahanga wahariwe kurwanya SIDA mu karere ka Karonga gaherereye mu majyaruguru.	citizens of malawi have given their opinions on the government's house-to-house testing programs at the beginning of the coming year. supporters argue that this step is urgently needed because 100 malawians are infected with hiv every day, and 138 die from aids-related illnesses daily. health minister jean kalirani announced the program during the commemoration of the international day dedicated to fighting aids in the karonga region in the north.
644	"""We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not. And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need. And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative,"" said Kalirani."	Tuzajya mu midugudu dusaba amaraso kugira ngo tumenye niba uwo muntu afite virusi itera SIDA cyangwa niba atari bo. Kandi abazagaragara ko banduye virusi itera SIDA bazahabwa ubwitonzi bakeneye.

645	Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services. She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030. Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago.	Kalirani yavuze ko ubukangurambaga buzatangira hagati muri Werurwe kandi bugamije kugera kuri buri wese mu gihugu, harimo n'abantu bari kure y'ibigo nderabuzima bitanga serivisi zipimisha virusi itera SIDA. Yavuze ko ubukangurambaga bujyanye n'intego yo guhagarika ubwandu bwa virusi itera SIDA mu 2030. Muri iki gihe umubare w'ababana na virusi itera SIDA uri muri Malawi uri ku gipimo cya 10 ku ijana, ukaba wagabanutseho gato mu myaka itatu ishize.	kalirani said that the awareness campaign will start in april and aims to reach everyone in the country, including people far from health centers that provide hiv testing services. he said the campaign is part of the goal to end the aids epidemic by 2030. currently, the number of people living with hiv in malawi is at 10 percent, which has slightly decreased in the past three years.
646	The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy.	Iri tangazo ryateje ubwoba bamwe mu Banya Malawi, nka Steven Jailosi, umwarimu w’ishuri ryibanze mu cyaro cya Blantyre, bumva ko ubukangurambaga bushobora guhungabanya ubuzima bwite bw’abaturage.	this announcement has caused fear among some malawians, like steven jailosi, a primary school teacher in the village of blantyre, who believe that the unrest could disrupt the lives of the citizens.
647	"""I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. HIV testing is supposed to be private. No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them,"" said Jailosi."	"Jailosi ati: ""Ntekereza ko atari byiza kuko bazinjira mu buzima bwacu.

649	"""Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions,"" said Makonokaya."	Guverinoma igomba ahubwo kujyana amavuriro agendanwa mu midugudu aho abantu bazashobora kuyageraho bonyine aho kwipimisha mu ngo zabo, kuko ibyo bivuze ko bamwe mu bantu batagomba kumenya uko abandi baturage bazabimenya. kuberako, urabizi, iyo umuntu yapimwe uba ugaragaje reaction zimwe , Makonokaya.	the government should instead bring the vaccines to the villages where people can easily access them, rather than vaccinating them in their homes, because this implies that some people should not know how other citizens will react to it. you know, when a person is vaccinated, they may show certain reactions, makonokaya.
650	"Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own ""without being pushed."""

688	Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty	Raporo: Inganda zishobora kuvana ibihugu bikennye mubukene	report: companies can pull poor countries out of poverty.
689	A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies.	Raporo nshya y’umuryango w’abibumbye irasaba ibihugu bikennye cyane ku isi kuva mu bikorwa bito bikagera ku musaruro mwinshi kugira ngo ubukungu bwiyongere.	the new report from the united nations calls on the world's richest countries to significantly increase their efforts from small actions to large-scale results in order to boost the economy.
690	"In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD — the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development — says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the ""poverty trap,"" which is stunting economic growth and development."	"Muri raporo y’ibihugu byateye imbere cyane cyane, UNCTAD - Inama y’umuryango w’abibumbye ishinzwe ubucuruzi n’iterambere - ivuga ko ibyo bihugu bigomba guhindura imiterere y’ubukungu kugira ngo bikure mu ""mutego w’ubukene,"" bidindiza iterambere ry’ubukungu n’iterambere."	"in the report of the most advanced countries, unctad - the united nations conference on trade and development - states that these countries need to change their economic structures in order to escape the ""poverty trap,"" slowing down economic and overall development."
691	"Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers ""Least Developed Countries"" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015."	"Mu bihugu 48 Umuryango w'abibumbye ufata ""Ibihugu byateye imbere cyane"" (LDCs), kimwe gusa, Laos, kiri mu nzira zo kugera ku ntego zirindwi z'ikinyagihumbi (MDG) muri 2015."	"in 48 countries, the united nations considers ""least developed countries"" (ldcs), only one, laos, is on track to achieve the eight millennium development goals (mdg) by 2015."
692	Only four African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda — are likely to meet a majority of these targets.	Ibihugu bine bya Afurika gusa - Etiyopiya, Malawi, u Rwanda na Uganda - birashoboka ko byujuje ibyinshi muri byo.	only four african countries - ethiopia, malawi, rwanda and uganda - may have achieved much in them.
693	This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years. The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015. The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030.	Iri suzuma rirakaze cyane bitewe n’ibibazo bikomeye bitegereje ibi bihugu mu myaka iri imbere. MDGs yihaye intego ibihugu kugabanya ubukene bw’ubukene bitarenze 2015. Icyiswe intego z’iterambere rirambye, kiva aho MDGs ziva, zirahamagarira guca ubukene mu 2030.	this crisis has become very severe due to the major problems facing these countries in the coming years. the mdgs aimed to reduce extreme poverty by 2015. the so-called sustainable development goals, where the mdgs left off, aim to end poverty by 2030.
694	According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off.	Nk’uko byatangajwe na Taffere Tesfachew, umuyobozi wa UNCTAD ukorana n'ibihugu by'Afurika, nta kintu na kimwe cyaba ari igitangaza kuri LDCs kubikuramo.	as announced by taffere tesfachew, the unctad leader working with african countries, there would be nothing surprising about ldcs excluding it.
695	In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies.	Kugirango ibihugu bidateye imbere bigere kuri iyi mikorere yigitangaza, avuga ko bizakenera guhindura imiterere yubukungu.	for countries to reach this amazing operation, he says they will need to change their economic behavior.
696	He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services.	Abwira IJWI ibi bivuze guhindura imirimo mu bikorwa bifite umusaruro muke, nk'ubuhinzi buciriritse na serivisi ku bikorwa byinshi bifite umusaruro mwinshi, nko gukora na serivisi zifite agaciro kanini.	they told ijwi that this means changing activities into small-scale operations, such as intensive farming and services on many high-yield operations, such as working with high-value services.
697	"""Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, that is why this call for manufacturing,"" he said. ""Countries that are using policies to shift and influence capital and labor to move into this activity sector tend to do better."""	"Ibihugu byazamutse ni byo bitanga amahirwe ku bava mu buhinzi kwishora mu bintu bongerera agaciro, aho bakura amahugurwa kandi uko bigenda, inganda zikunda kugira ibintu nk'ibyo, niyo mpamvu ibi guhamagarira gukora . ""Ibihugu bikoresha politiki mu guhindura no guhindura igishoro n'umurimo kugira ngo byinjire muri uru rwego rw'ibikorwa usanga bikora neza."""	"""the countries that have succeeded are those that give opportunities to farmers to invest in value-added products, where they receive training and as it goes, factories tend to produce such things, that's why these calls to action. ""countries use politics to change and transform the sector and work to enter this level of operations, you find they do well."""
698	Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods. This, he says, encourages investment.	Tesfachew avuga ko izo nzego zitanga umusaruro mwinshi zikunda kwishyura umushahara munini kandi bigatuma ibicuruzwa bikenerwa. Avuga ko ibi bitera inkunga ishoramari.	tesfachew says that these institutions produce a lot of output, prefer to pay high salaries and this causes inflation. he says this leads to investment support.
699	On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly. UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community. And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year.	Ku isura, bigaragara ko LDC idakora nabi. Amakuru y’ubukungu ya UNCTAD yerekana iterambere muri ibi bihugu bikennye hagati ya 2002 na 2008 yarenze intego irindwi ku ijana yashyizweho n’umuryango mpuzamahanga. Kandi, na nyuma y’ibibazo by’amafaranga yo mu 2008, UNCTAD ivuga ko LDC yazamutse vuba kurusha ibindi bihugu bikiri mu nzira y'amajyambere, ku kigereranyo cya 5.7 ku ijana ku mwaka.	on the surface, it appears that the ldc is not performing poorly. unctad's economic news shows that development in these countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seventh goal set by the international community. also, even after the financial problems in 2008, unctad states that the ldc recovered faster than other developing countries, at an annual rate of 5.7 percent.
700	But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain. They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty.	Ariko abahanga mu bukungu bo muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika bavuga ko icyerekezo cy’ibihugu bitaratera imbere mu gihe gito kandi giciriritse bikomeje kutamenyekana. Bavuga ko kongera umusaruro w’abaturage aribwo buryo bwiza bwo guca intege iterambere ry’abantu n’ubukungu bikomeje kubashora mu bukene.	however, economic experts in the united states government say that the outlook for countries that do not progress in a short time and remain uncertain is unclear. they argue that increasing the productivity of the population is the best way to overcome the challenges of people's development and poverty that continue to push them into poverty.

That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday.

703	Junior Davis, U.N. economic affairs officer for Africa, said African countries have not been able to translate their economic growth into structural transformation.	Junior Davis, ushinzwe ibibazo by’ubukungu muri Amerika muri Afurika, yavuze ko ibihugu bya Afurika bitashoboye guhindura ubukungu bwabyo mu guhindura imiterere.	junior davis, responsible for economic issues in america in africa, said that african countries have failed to change their economy by changing their behavior.
704	"""We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities,"" Davis said. ""These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development. And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities."""	"Davis yagize ati: ""Turatekereza ko aribyo kuko ibyo bihugu bitibanze cyane ku kubaka icyo twita ubushobozi bwabo bwo gutanga umusaruro"".

705	Slow progress	Buhoro buhoro	slowly slowly
706	African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow. Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity. And economic development is needed to make gains in human development.
