1	The Nigerian government announced Friday it was suspending Twitter in the country, just days after Twitter deleted a harmful tweet by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari that suggested the state would use violence against the Igbo ethnic group.	Serikali ya Naijeria imetangaza siku ya Ijumaa kwamba inaufungia mtandao wa Twita nchini humo, siku kadhaa baada ya mtandao huo kufuta twiti hatari iliyoandikwa na Rais wa Naijeria Muhammadu Buhari iliyodai kwamba serikali itatumia nguvu dhidi ya kabila la Igbo.	the nigerian government announced on friday that it is banning twitter in the country, a few days after the network deleted a dangerous tweet written by nigerian president muhammadu buhari claiming that the government will use force against the igbo tribe.
2	Despite removing the tweet, the message continues to circulate on social media, bringing up painful memories of a civil war that left more than one million dead.	Pamoja na kuondolewa kwa twiti hiyo, ujumbe uliendea kusambaa kwenye mitandao ya kijamii, hali iliyokumbushia maumivu ya vita vya wenyewe kwa wenyewe vilivyopoteza maisha ya watu zaidi ya milioni moja.	despite the removal of that tweet, the message continued to spread on social media, a situation that reminded of the pain of the civil wars that claimed the lives of more than one million people.

Kwenye mfululizo wa twiti zilizochapishwa mnamo June 1, 2021, Buhari anatishia kuwashughulikia Wanaijeria wanaotoka kwenye sehemu ya mashariki ya nchi hiyo kwa kutumia lugha wanayoielewa, akirejea vita vya wenyewe kwa wenyewe nchini Naijeria kati ya mwaka 1967-1970 dhidi ya vuguvugu la kujitenga la Jamhuri ya Biafra, kusini mashariki mwa Naijeria.	in a series of tweets published on june 1, 2021, buhari threatens to deal with nigerians coming from the eastern part of the country using language they understand, referring to the civil war in nigeria between 1967-1970 against the secessionist movement of the republic of biafra, southeast of nigeria.
5	The tweets came after a series of attacks on government and security installations in the region, which have been blamed on an armed group linked to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a pro-Biafra secessionist movement.	Twiti hiyo iliandikwa baada ya mfululizo wa mashambulio dhidi ya serikali na vyombo vya usalama kwenye eneo hilo, ambalo linalaumiwa kuwa na kikundi cha kijeshi  kinachohusishwa na Wenyeji wa Biafra (IPOB), vuguvugu la watu wanaotaka sehemu ya Biafra ijitenge.	that tweet was written after a series of attacks against the government and security forces in the area, which is blamed on a military group associated with the indigenous people of biafra (ipob), a movement of people wanting a part of biafra to secede.
6	IPOB denied involvement in the attack, says the Voice of America.	Kikundi hicho kimekanusha kuhusika na mashambulizi hayo, kwa mujibu wa Sauti ya Amerika.	the group has denied involvement in the attacks, according to voice of america.
7	Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War, Buharis now-deleted tweet said:	Wengi wa wale wanaoonesha utovu wa nidhamu leo walikuwa wadogo kuelewa uharibifu na upotevu wa maisha ya watu uliotokea wakati wa Mapigano ya Wenyewe kwa Wenyewe nchini Naijeria, ilisema twiti ya Buhari ambayo sasa imefutwa:	many of those showing indiscipline today were too young to understand the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the civil war in nigeria, said a tweet from buhari which has now been deleted.

9	The tweets reiterated comments made by a visibly irritated Buhari in the State House, Nigerias capital Abuja, about the wave of arson attacks on electoral officers.	Twiti zilizojibu mapigo kwa matamshi hayo yaliyotolewa na Buhari aliyeonekana dhahiri kuwa na hasira akiwa katika Ikulu ya nchi hiyo, makao makuu ya nchi, Abuja, kuhusu mwelekeo wa mashambulizi dhidi ya maafisa wa uchaguzi.	tweets that responded to the remarks made by an evidently angry buhari at the country's presidential palace, the nation's headquarters, abuja, about the direction of attacks against election officials.

11	They have made their case, they just wanted to destroy the country, he said, appearing to reference secessionist agitators:	Wamesema walichokitaka, lakini sasa wanataka kuiangamiza nchi, alisema, akionekana kuwazungumzia watu hao wanaotaka kujitenga:	they said what they wanted, but now they want to destroy the country, he said, apparently referring to those people who want to secede.
12	Buhari made the statement himself.	Buhari amezungumza kwa kinywa chake	buhari has spoken from his own mouth.
13	Buhari, a retired general, served in the army during Nigerias civil war.	Buhari, jenerali mstaafu, alikuwa jeshini wakati wa vita vya wenyewe kwa wenyewe nchini Naijeria.	buhari, a retired general, was in the military during the civil war in nigeria.
14	The brutal civil war led to the death of over one million ethnic Igbos and other Easterners, according to Chima J. Korieh, a professor of African History at United States Marquette University.	Vita hivyo vibaya vilisababisha vifo vya zaidi ya watu milioni wa kabila la Igbo na wakazi wengine wa ukanda wa Mashariki, kwa mujibu wa Chima J. Korieh, profesa wa Historia ya Afrika kwenye Chuo Kikuu cha Marquette nchini Marekani.	the war was so bad that it caused the deaths of more than a million igbo people and other residents of the eastern region, according to chima j. korieh, a professor of african history at marquette university in the united states.
15	For most Nigerians, the war over the breakaway state of Biafra is generally regarded as an unfortunate episode best forgotten, but for the Igbo people who fought for secession, it remains a life-defining event, asserts Nigerian writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani.	Kwa Wanaijeria wengi, vita vya kujitenga kwa jimbo la Biafra, kwa ujumla, huchukuliwa kama tukio la baya la kusahauliwa, lakini kwa watu wa Igbo waliopambana kujitenga, linabaki kuwa tukuo lililobadili maana ya maisha yao, anasema mwandishi wa Naijeria Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani.	for many nigerians, the war for the secession of the biafra state is generally considered a terrible forgotten event, but for the igbo people who fought to secede, it remains an event that changed the meaning of their lives, says nigerian writer adaobi tricia nwaubani.

17	Twitter policy on hateful conduct prohibits tweets that promote violence or threaten people based on race, ethnicity, national origin.	Sera ya Twita kuhusu tabia za chuki inazuia twiti ambazo zinahubiri ghasia na kutishia watu kwa kigezo cha rangi, kabila, asili ya utaifa wa mtu.	twitter's policy on hate behavior prohibits tweets that preach violence and threaten people on the basis of race, tribe, or nationality.
18	Such tweets, like Buharis, are either deleted by the tech company or the user is compelled to remove the violating content.	Twiti za namna hiyo, kama ya Buhari, hufutwa na kampuni hiyo au watumiaji wenyewe hulazimisha kufuta maudhui yanayokwenda kinyume na sera.	tweets of that nature, like buhari's, are deleted by the company or the users themselves are forced to delete content that goes against the policy.
19	Lai Mohammed, Nigerias minister of information, described the removal of the president's tweet by the social media company as very suspect:	Lai Mohammed, waziri wa habari wa Naijeria, alieleza kuondolewa kwa twiti ya rais huyo na kampuni hiyo ya mitandao ya kijamii kama tukio la kushukiwa sana:	lai mohammed, nigeria's minister of information, described the removal of the president's tweet by that social media company as a highly suspicious event.

21	Deleted abusive tweets are still visible	Twiti zenye vitisho bado zinaonekana mtandaoni	threatening tweets are still visible online.
22	An investigation by the social media forensic expert Digital Africa Research Lab (DigiAfricaLab) reveals that Buharis abusive tweet is still visible across numerous timelines two days after it was deleted by Twitter, due to Quote Tweets:	Uchunguzi uliofanywa na mtaalam wa mtandao ya kijamii wa Digital Africa Research Lab (DigiAfricaLab) unaonesha kwamba twiti ya vitisho iliyoandikwa na Buhari bado inaonekana kwenye akaunti kadhaa siku mbili baada ya kuwa imefutwa na Twita, shauri ya kunukuliwa na watumiaji wengine:	the investigation conducted by a specialist from the digital africa research lab (digiafricalab) social network shows that the threatening tweet written by buhari is still visible on several accounts two days after it was deleted by twitter, due to being quoted by other users.
23	Over 30 hours after Twitter deleted a Tweet by Nigerian president @MBuhari for violating its rules, the deleted Tweet REMAINS VISIBLE across numerous timelines due to Quote Tweets!	Zaidi ya saa 30 baada ya Twita kufuta twiti ya rais wa Naijeria @MBuhari kwa kosa la kuvunja sheria, twitiiliyofutwa BADO INAONEKANA kwenye akaunti nyingi mtandaoni kwa sababu ya kunukuliwa!	more than 30 hours after twitter deleted a tweet from the president of nigeria @mbuhari for breaking the law, the deleted tweet still appears on many online accounts because it was quoted!
24	Signing onto different accounts through different devices, DigiAfricaLab was still able to view the more than 17,000 quoted tweets made by users before the social media company pulled down the offensive tweets from the timelines of @MBuhari and @NGRPresident, both verified Twitter handles of President Buhari.	Kwa kuingia mtandao kwa kutumia akaunti tofauti kupitia vifaa tofauti, DigiAfricaLab iliweza kuona zaidi ya twiti 17,000 zilizonukuliwa na watumiaji kabla kampuni hiyo ya mtandao wa kijamii haijaifuta twiti hiyo kutoka kwenye akaunti ya @MBuhari na @NGRPresident, zote zikiwa ni anuani za twita zilizohakikiwa zinazotumika na Rais Buhari.	by logging into the network using different accounts through different devices, digiafricalab was able to see more than 17,000 tweets quoted by users before the social network company deleted the tweet from the @mbuhari and @ngrpresident accounts, both of which are verified twitter addresses used by president buhari.
25	Furthermore, DigiAfricaLab was able to click and expand President Buharis deleted tweet.	Zaidi ya hayo, DigiAfricaLab iliweza kubofya na kukuza twiti ya Rais Buhari iliypfutwa.	moreover, digiafricalab was able to capture and amplify president buhari's deleted tweet.
26	Deleted tweets may still be visible to Twitter users because Twitter's software, also called, Application Programming Interface (API) relies on third-party applications that connect to Twitter servers via a URL.	Twiti zil nizofutwa zinaweza kuendelea kuonekana kwa watumiaji wa mtandao wa twita kwa sababu zana inayotumiwa na Twita (API) hutegemea zana za mitandao mingine inayounganisha kazi data za Twita kwa kupitia URL.	tweets that have been deleted may continue to be visible to twitter users because the tool used by twitter (api) depends on tools from other networks that link twitter's work data through the url.
27	Another reason, according to J. D. Biersdorfer of New York Times, was that deleted tweets may still be cached away and therefore available to show up in search results  until the site goes indexing again and updates itself with a fresh copy of your Twitter profile and posts.	Sababu nyingine, kwa mujibu wa  J. D. Biersdorfer wa New York Times, ni kwamba twiti zilizofutwa zinaweza kuwa bado zinapatikana na hivyo kuonekana kwenye matokeo ya utafutaji mtandaoni  mpaka tovuti ihuishwe na nakala mpya ya twiti kwenye ukurasa mkuu wa akaunti husika.	another reason, according to j. d. biersdorfer of the new york times, is that deleted tweets may still be available and thus appear in online search results until the website is refreshed with a new copy of the tweet on the main page of the relevant account.

30	In addition, Nigerian Twitter users from different ethnic groups also adopted Igbo names to show their solidarity with the Igbo people.	kadhalika, watumiaji wa mtandao wa Twita nchini Naijeria kutoka kwenye makundi mbalimbali ya kikabila pia walitumia majina ya lugha ya Igbo  kama namna ya kusimama na watu wa kabila la Igbo.	likewise, twitter users in nigeria from various ethnic groups also used igbo language names as a way to stand with the igbo people.
31	An analysis conducted on June 4, 2021 by Global Voices on the Brand Mentions app revealed that in the past seven days, the #IAmIgboToo hashtag had 508 mentions, 319,200 interactions, 457,500 reach, and 313,100 shares on both Twitter and Instagram.

39	Nigerian hip-hop recording artist and record producer Jude Abaga (M.I Abaga) expressed his desire for the country to move beyond these hateful statements:	Msanii wa muziki wa kufoka foka na mzalishaji wa muziki Jude Abaga (M.I Abaga) alionesha shauku yake kwa nchi hii kuendelea mbele ya matamshi haya yaliyojaa chuki:	music artist and music producer jude abaga (m.i abaga) expressed his enthusiasm for this country to move forward in the face of these hate-filled remarks.
40	The narrative that Nigeria hates Igbo people is an outdated context that will leave with the old and bitter generation	Maelezo kwamba Naijeria inawachukua watu wa Igbo ni ya kishamba na yanaacha mtazamo ule ule usiobadilika	the notion that nigeria is taking the igbo people for granted is primitive and leaves the same unchanging perspective.

53	Shaffie is insinuating that the lady who was pushed from the 12th floor of a building in Nairobi CBD after she said no to a man's advancements was because she was too loose & very available hence putting herself is such a situation.	Shaffie anasisitiza kwamba mwanamke huyo alisukumwa kutoka gorofa ya 12 ya jengo jijini Nairobi baada ya kusema hapana kwa mwanamume ni kwa sababu alijiachia sana na kuwa huru kwa hivyo kujiweka mwenyewe katika hali kama hiyo.	shaffie insists that the woman was pushed from the 12th floor of a building in nairobi after saying no to a man because she let herself go and was too free, thus putting herself in such a situation.
54	What the actual hell!	Ni kuzimu gani!	what the hell!
55	The case divided online users as a section of citizens took sides with the hosts.	Kesi hii imegawanya watumiaji wa mitandao kwani kuna baadhi yao wanakubaliana na watangazaji hao.	this case has divided internet users as some of them agree with those broadcasters.
56	Although the trio was fired by the radio station, it brought to the fore how hostile the Kenyan online space has become for women.	Ingawa watatu hao walifukuzwa kazi na kituo hicho cha redio, ilileta wazi jinsi uhasama wa nafasi mkondoni ya Kenya imekua kwa wanawake.	although the three were fired by the radio station, it highlighted how online space hostility in kenya has grown for women.

Na ingawa mwaka 2018 sheria dhidi ya unyanyasaji wa kimtandao ilipitishwa nchini  ambayo hufafanua tabia kama kushirikiana na wengine kwa njia ambayo inaweza kusababisha wasiwasi au hofu ya vurugu kwao au uharibifu au upotezaji wa mali ya watu hao kwa adhabu ya hadi miaka 10 jela, bado uonevu wa watu wengi mtandaoni bado imekithiri sana.	and although in 2018 a law against cyber harassment was passed in the country, which defines behavior such as collaborating with others in a way that could cause them anxiety or fear of violence to them or damage or loss of their property with a penalty of up to 10 years in jail, online bullying of many people is still very rampant.

66	But Cherotich didnt receive the warm welcome she may have anticipated.	Lakini Cherotich hakupokelewa kwa uchangamfu kama alivyotarajia.	but cherotich was not received as warmly as she had expected.
67	After doing media interviews in April 2020, she was subjected to online harassment and backlash from Kenyans on Twitter (or famously #KOT, a term often used to describe the collective of active Kenyans online known to rally against various causes or personalities) who sought to discredit and question the truth behind her story.

Mwanzoni mwa mwaka, msemaji mkuu wa Ikulu Kanze Dena pia aliathirika na unyanyasaji wa kimtandoa wa Kenya.	at the beginning of the year, the chief speaker of the state house, kanze dena, was also affected by kenya's cyber harassment.

109	Caribbean nations have, one by one, been readjusting their law books to reflect greater equity for LGBTQ+ people by decriminalising colonial-era sodomy clauses.	Nchi za Caribiani, moja baada ya nyingine, zimekuwa zikirekebisha vitabu vyake vya sheria kuakisi usawa zaidi kwa watu wenye kupenda mapenzi ya jinsia moja kwa kuondoa vipengele vya enzi za ukoloni vilivyokuwa vinazuia tabia ya kuingiliana kinyume na maumbile.	caribbean countries, one after another, have been amending their law books to reflect more equality for people who love the same sex by removing colonial-era clauses that were prohibiting unnatural intercourse.

111	Two years later, Trinidad and Tobago followed suit, but the ripple effect of dismantling connected pieces of legislation has been slower in coming.	Miaka miwili baadae, Trinidad na Tobago ikafuatia, ingawa hatua yake hiyo haijatafsirika kwenye mabadiliko ya sheria.	two years later, trinidad and tobago followed, although this step has not been translated into legal changes.
112	Three years after the court deemed the country's buggery laws unconstitutional, Trinidad and Tobago's Equal Opportunity Act (EOA) finally looks set to amend its regulations pertaining to sexual orientation.	Miaka mitatu baada ya mahakama kutamka wazi kwamba sheria hizo zinakwenda kinyume na katiba, hatimaye Trinadad na Tobago inaonekana iko njiani kurekebisha kanuni za Sheria ya Fursa Sawa (EOA) zinazohusiana na ushoga.	three years after the court clearly stated that these laws are contrary to the constitution, trinidad and tobago finally appears to be on the way to amend the equal opportunity act (eoa) regulations related to homosexuality.
113	The Act's self-proclaimed purpose is to prohibit certain kinds of discrimination and promote equality of opportunity between persons of different status.	Sheria hiyo ina lengo linalosomekana kama, kuzuia aina fulani za ubaguzi na kukuza usawa wa fursa baina ya watu wenye hali tofauti.	that law has an objective that reads as, to prevent certain types of discrimination and promote equality of opportunity among people with different conditions.
114	To this end, an Equal Opportunity Commission and an Equal Opportunity Tribunal were established to handle such issues but so far, neither body has been unable to deal with matters of discrimination based on sexual orientation.	Kwa minajili ya lengo hiyo,  Tume ya Fursa na Mahakama ya Fursa Sawa zilianzishwa ili kushughulikia masuala hayo lakini mpaka sasa, vyombo hivyo vinashindwa kushughulikia masuala ya ubaguzi dhidi ya ushoga.	for that purpose, the opportunity commission and the equal opportunity court were established to deal with these issues but so far, these bodies have failed to address issues of discrimination against homosexuality.
115	The current laws only cover discrimination based on sex, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, marital status, or disability in matters of employment, training, education, and the like.	Sheria zilizopo zinashughulikia ubaguzi wa kijinsia, rangi, kabila, asili, dini, hali ya ndoa, au ulemavu kwenye masuala ya ajira, mafunzo, elimu na kadhalika.	existing laws address discrimination based on gender, color, tribe, origin, religion, marital status, or disability in matters of employment, training, education and so on.
116	Pressure to amend the current Act mounted after Scotiabank Trinidad and Tobago announced on April 14 that it would extend its health benefits to the partners of employees in same-sex relationships, in the same way it already offered access to the common-law partners of heterosexual employees.	Shinikizo la kurekebisha Sheria ya sasa liliongezeka baada ya Benki ya Scotiabank nchini Trinidad na Tobago kutangaza mnamo Aprili 14 kwamba itapanua wigo wa huduma za afya kwa wenzi wa waajiriwa walio kwenye mahusiano ya jinsia moja, kwa namna ile ile ilivyo kwa wenzi wa waajiriwa wa jinsia tofauti.	the pressure to amend the current law increased after scotiabank in trinidad and tobago announced on april 14 that it would expand the scope of health services for employees' partners in same-sex relationships, in the same way as it is for employees' partners of different sexes.
117	The announcement sparked a nationwide conversation and was praised by the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) and Ian Roach, chairman of the Equal Opportunity Commission, who noted in an interview with the Trinidad and Tobago Newsday:	Tangazo hilo liliibua majadiliano makali nchini humo na pia kupongezwa na Chemba ya Biashara ya Marekani (AMCHAM) na Ian Roach, mwenyekiti wa Tume ya Fursa Sawa, aliyenukuliwa katika majadiliano yake na gazeti la Newsday la Trinidad na Tobago akisema:	the announcement sparked intense debate in the country and was also commended by the american chamber of commerce (amcham) and ian roach, chairman of the equal opportunity commission, who was quoted in his discussions with the newsday newspaper of trinidad and tobago saying:
118	It is a good move on the part of the private sector and especially by the bank, who has a wide cross-section of employees.	Ni hatua nzuri kwa upande wa sekta binafsi na hasa kwa benki, ambayo ina waajiriwa wa aina mbalimbali.	it is a good step for the private sector and especially for the bank, which employs various types of employees.
119	It is important that the others should follow suit, past what the law insists.	Ni muhimu na wengine wakaiga hatua hii, pamoja na kile ambacho sheria inasisitiza.	it is important that others emulate this step, along with what the law emphasizes.
120	Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi has said he is encouraged by Scotiabank's inclusive initiative and remains open to doing what is necessary to address the spectrums of discrimination that exist.	Mwanasheria Mkuu wa Serikali Faris Al-Rawi amesema ametiwa moyo na hatua hiyo ya Benki ya Scotiabank kulinda haki za watu na kwamba milango iko wazi kufanya kile kinachohitajika ili kuondoa aina mbalimbali za ubaguzi unaoendelea kuwepo nchini humo.	the attorney general faris al-rawi said he was encouraged by scotiabank's move to protect people's rights and that the doors are open to do what is necessary to eliminate various forms of ongoing discrimination in the country.
121	Al-Rawi's stance is markedly different from his position after the 2018 High Court ruling; soon after the unconstitutional verdict was handed down, the state announced its intention to appeal.	Msimamo huo wa Al-Rawi unaonekana kubadilika kulingana na msimamo aliokuwa nao baada ya Hukumu ya Mahakama Kuu ya 2018; mara tu baada ya uamuzi usio wa kikatiba kutolewa, serikali ilitangaza nia yake ya kukata rufaa.	that position of al-rawi seems to change according to the stance he had after the 2018 high court ruling; immediately after the unconstitutional decision was issued, the government announced its intention to appeal.
122	While Trinidad and Tobago has undeniably made great strides when it comes to discrimination for members of the local LGBTQ+ community, homophobiamuch of it rationalised on religious groundsstill exists.	Wakati Trinidad na Tobago zimefanya maendeleo makubwa kwenye kuondoa aina mbalimbali za ubaguzi, lakini linapokuja suala la ubaguzi dhidi ya mashoga wa nchi hiyo, hofu ya mashogakwa kutumia hoja za kidinibado hali haijabadilika sana.	while trinidad and tobago have made significant progress in eliminating various forms of discrimination, when it comes to discrimination against the country's homosexuals, the fear of homosexuals using religious arguments has not changed much.
123	Public reactions to Scotiabank's announcement on social media networking platforms like Facebook were met with lots of criticism.	Kwa kutazama mwitikio wa wananchi dhidi ya tangazo la Benki ya Scotiabank kwenye majukwaa ya mitandao ya kijamii kama Facebook upinzani ulikuwa mkubwa.	by looking at the response of the citizens against the scotiabank announcement on social media platforms like facebook, the opposition was significant.
124	Meanwhile, LGBTQ+ people continue to face not just discrimination, but acts of violence, many of them ending fatally.	Wakati huo huo, mashoga wanaendelea si tu kukabiliana na ubaguzi, lakini pia vitendo vya ukatili, vingi vikiishia kwa kupoteza maisha.	at the same time, homosexuals continue not only to face discrimination, but also acts of violence, many ending in loss of life.
125	Most recently, the murder of Marcus Anthony Singh, a member of the local LGBTQ+ community, sparked online conversations about the reality that many LGBTQ+ people face in terms of both security and discriminatory practices.	Katika tukio la hivi karibuni,  kifo cha Marcus Anthony Singh, mwanachama wa chama cha mashoga kwenye eneo analoishi, kiliibua mjadala mzito mtandao kuhusu mazingira magumu ambayo mashoga wanakabiliana nayo hususani usalama wao sambamba na vitendo vya ubaguzi.	in the recent event, the death of marcus anthony singh, a member of the gay community in his area, sparked a serious online debate about the harsh conditions that gays face, especially their safety along with acts of discrimination.
126	Many of those conversations have been happening on Twitter Spaces, which provide an audio-only chat forum for safe discussion and education.	Mazungumzo hayo mengi yamekuwa yakifanyika kupitia teknolojia ya Twitter Spaces, jukwaa la mazungumzo ya sauti linalowezesha mijadala na elimu salama.	those many conversations have been taking place through twitter spaces technology, a voice chat platform that enables safe discussions and education.
127	While Attorney General Al Rawi has not provided a timeline by which the amendments to the legislation will be tackled, for the LGBTQ+ community and its allies, the hope remains that moves by private sector companies like Scotiabank will soon be followed by the government, eventually leading to societal change.	Wakati Mwanasheria Mkuu wa Serikali Al Rawi hajatoa muda rasmi wa kufanyika mabadiliko hayo ya sheria, kwa mashoga na washirika wao, matumaini yanabaki kwamba huenda hatua zinazochukuliwa na makampuni binafsi kama Benki ya Scotiabank si muda mrefu zitaanza kuchukuliwa na serikali, na hatimaye kuleta mabadiliko yenye sura ya jamii nzima.	while attorney general al rawi has not given an official time for these legal changes to take place, for the gay community and their allies, hope remains that the steps being taken by private companies like scotiabank will soon be adopted by the government, ultimately bringing about changes that reflect the entire society.

130	For internet and technology companies, collecting user data remains one of their main sources of income.	Kwa kampuni za mtandao wa intaneti na teknolojia, ukusanyaji wa taarifa za watumiaji wa mtandao wa intaneti umekuwa ni chanzo chao kikuu cha kujipatia kipato.	for internet and technology companies, the collection of user data has become their main source of income.
131	But this business model includes a security risk for users, as demonstrated by recurring cases of undisclosed commercial use, massive leaks, and hacking incidents.	Hata hivyo, namna hii ya kujipatia kipato inawaweka hatarini watumiaji kama inavyojidhihirisha katika matukio ya mara kwa mara ya uwekaji wazi wa taarifa za kibiashara, uvujaji mkubwa wa taarifa na udukuaji.	however, this way of earning income puts users at risk as evidenced by frequent incidents of business information exposure, major data leaks, and hacking.
132	Is there a credible solution for strengthening users privacy?	Je, kuna njia muafaka ya kuboresha haki ya faragha ya watumiaji wa mtandao wa intaneti?	is there a proper way to improve the privacy rights of internet users?
133	Companies such as Google and Apple focus on collecting daily user data, mostly via smartphones, and combining information from the applications running over time: the user's contacts and agenda, for example.	Kampuni kama vile Google na Apple zimewekeza nguvu kukusanya kila siku taarifa za wateja wao, haswa kupitia simu za mkononi, na muunganiko wa vitumizi mbalimbali vinavyotumiwa mara kwa mara kama vile kalenda na ajenda.	companies such as google and apple have invested heavily in collecting customer data daily, especially through mobile phones, and the integration of various frequently used applications such as calendars and agendas.
134	A multitude of apps track the user's location in real time, while health and sports apps dig deep into their biometric information.	Vitumizi kadha wa kadha vimekuwa vikifuatilia mahali halisi mtu alipo, na kwa upande mwingine vitumizi vya masuala ya afya na michezo vikijikita katika kukusanya taarifa za vinasaba vya wateja.	various applications have been tracking a person's exact location, and on the other hand, health and sports applications focus on collecting customers' genetic information.
135	This data is collected and analyzed, allegedly to offer more tailored and sophisticated services.	Inaaminika kuwa, taarifa hizi zinakusanywa na kuchanganuliwa kwa lengo la kumrahisishia na kumpatia mtumiaji kile anachokihitaji kwa haraka.	it is believed that, this information is collected and analyzed with the aim of facilitating and providing the user with what they need quickly.
136	In fact, most users do not realize they are offering a wealth of data to service providers and platform owners, free of charge.	Hata hivyo, ukweli ni kwamba, watumiaji wa intaneti na vitumizi vya kiteknolojia hawafahamu kuwa, wanatoa taarifa zao bure bila ya malipo yoyote.	however, the truth is that, internet users and technology users do not realize that they are giving out their information for free without any charges.
137	Privacy activists, such as Austrian Max Schrems, have expressed strong concerns about this model.	Wanaharakati wa masuala ya sera ya faragha ya mtandaoni kama vile  Raia wa Austria, Max Schrems,  ameonesha hisia zake kuhusu utaratibu huu wa kampuni za intaneti na vitumizi vya teknolojia wa kujipatia kipato kupitia taarifa za wateja wao.	online privacy policy activists such as austrian citizen, max schrems, have expressed their feelings about this procedure of internet companies and technology uses to earn income through their customers' information.

139	This was perhaps best illustrated by the Facebook scandal known as the Cambridge Analytica case  in which British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users without consent, in order to provide analytical assistance to the 2016 presidential campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.	Moja ya matukio kama haya pengine yameelezwa vizuri sana kupitia tukio la skendo ya Facebook linalofahamika kama kesi ya Cambridge Analytica ambapo Taasisi binafsi ya ushauri ya Cambridge Analytica ilijikusanyia taarifa binafsi za watumiaji milioni 87 wa Facebook bila idhini yao kwa lengo la  kuwasaidia wagombea kiti cha Urais Ted Cruz na Donald Trump mapema mwaka 2016.	one of such incidents may have been best described through the facebook scandal known as the cambridge analytica case, where the private consulting firm cambridge analytica collected personal information from 87 million facebook users without their consent, with the aim of assisting presidential candidates ted cruz and donald trump in early 2016.
140	Schrems says he warned Facebook representatives about the data-mining activities of Cambridge Analytica, but could not convince them to act:	Schrems anasema kuwa aliwatahadharisha wawakilishi wa Facebook kuhusu matukio ya ukusanyaji taarifa za wateja wao uliokuwa unafanywa na taasisi ya Cambridge Analytica, na hata hivyo, hakuweza kuwashawishi kuchukua hatua:	schrems says he warned facebook representatives about the incidents of their customer data collection being done by cambridge analytica, and yet, he could not persuade them to take action.
141	They [Facebook representatives] explicitly said that in their view, by using the platform you consent to a situation where other people can install an app and gather your data.	Wawakilishi wa Facebook bila kumumunya maneno walisema kuwa kwa maoni yao, unapotumia jukwaa la mmiliki fulani unakuwa umeruhusu watu hao wapakie vitumizi vyao [kwenye simu za mkononi na vifaa vingine] kwa ajili ya kukusanya taarifa za mtumiaji.	the representatives of facebook, without mincing words, said that in their opinion, when you use a certain owner's platform, you have allowed those people to upload their applications [on mobile phones and other devices] to collect user information.
142	But why would you care about privacy if you have nothing to hide, after all?	Hata hivyo, ni kwa nini ujiulize kuhusu haki ya faragha mtandaoni ilhali huna chochote cha kuficha?	however, why question online privacy rights when you have nothing to hide?

144	Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.	Kufikiri kuwa hujali chochote kuhusu haki ya faragha mtandaoni kwa kuwa huna cha kuficha ni sawa na kufikiri kuwa hujali chochote kuhusu haki ya kujieleza kwa kuwa huna chochote cha kusema.	thinking that you don't care about online privacy because you have nothing to hide is the same as thinking that you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say.

149	Here is his view on the evolution of such technology:	Huu hapa ni mtazamo wake kuhusu maendeleo ya teknolojia hii ya habari:	this here is his perspective on the development of this information technology:
150	This is a philosophical question.	Hili ni swali la kifalsafa.	this is a philosophical question.
151	I personally have very mixed feelings about it because I've always been passionate about technology.	Binafsi nina hisia  mchanganyiko haswa kuhusu teknolojia ya habari kwa kuwa, mimi wakati wote nina mahaba makubwa kuhusu teknolojia.	personally, i have mixed feelings especially about information technology because, i always have a great passion for technology.
152	But at the same time, I feel that sometimes it's too much, and I miss the time when you had to find a phone booth to have a call.	Hata hivyo, kuna wakati ninahisi kuchoshwa, ninakumbuka nyakati zile ambazo ukihitaji kupiga simu, unaenda sehemu maalum iliyotengwa.	however, there are times when i feel tired, i remember those times when you needed to make a call, you would go to a special designated place.
153	It was probably a more carefree and [slower-paced] life.	Bila shaka yale yalikuwa maisha murua kabisa na yasiyo na haraka.	without a doubt, those were completely serene and unhurried lives.
154	Younger people might be surprised to know that until I was five, there was no phone at home and no television.	Vijana wanaweza kushangaa kuwa, hadi nilipofikisha miaka mitano, nyumbani hakukuwa na simu wala runinga.	young people may be surprised that, until i was five years old, there was neither a phone nor a television at home.
155	So sometimes I feel I lived a part of my life in a totally different world, that doesn't exist anymore.	Kuna wakati ninawaza kuwa niliishi maisha ya ulimwengu tofauti kabisa,  na ambayo kwa sasa hayapo kabisa.	there are times i think that i lived a life in a completely different world, which currently does not exist at all.
156	On the other hand, it's really exciting to see what we can do with modern technology, like having an HD video call with someone on the other side of the planet, and seeing all those electric cars that, at least, are not burning petrol and [filling] our lungs with the exhaust fumes.	Kwa upande mwingine, inafurahisha sana haswa tunapojaribu kuwaza ni jambo gani tunaweza kufanya kwa uwepo wa teknolojia za kisasa, kama vile kuwasiliana na mtu aliye sehemu tofauti kabisa ya ulimwengu kupitia picha za video za ubora wa hali ya juu sambamba na kushuhudia magari ya umeme yasiyotumia petroli inayojaza mapafu yetu kwa moshi hatari.	on the other hand, it is very exciting especially when we try to think about what we can do with the presence of modern technology, such as communicating with someone in a completely different part of the world through high-quality video images along with witnessing electric cars that do not use petrol that fills our lungs with dangerous smoke.
157	Besides the seductive dangers of nostalgia for those who still remember analog times, we are also facing a real risk of dependence on information technology.	Kwa wale wanaokumbuka, ukiachilia raha na karaha za miaka ya kipindi cha mfumo wa analogia, kwa sasa tunakabiliana na hatari kubwa ya utegemezi kwenye teknolojia ya habari.	for those who remember, apart from the joys and sorrows of the analog era, we are now facing a great risk of dependence on information technology.
158	A 2018 study linked behavioral problems in children with excessive use of smartphones, which was shown to cause issues including attention deficit disorder (ADD) and depression.	Utafiti uliofanyika mwaka 2018 uliohusisha  matatizo ya kitabia ya watoto na mazoea yaliyopitiliza ya matumizi ya simu janja , ulibaini kuwa, matumizi makubwa ya simu janja hupelekea matatizo kadha wa kadha yakiwemo Tatizo la Kukosa Umakini (ADD) na sonona.	the study conducted in 2018 involving children's behavioral problems and excessive smartphone use, found that excessive use of smartphones leads to various problems including attention deficit disorder (add) and depression.
159	A survey published in 2020 by Common Sense Media found that 50 percent of teenagers in the Los Angeles area feel dependent on their smartphones.	Utafiti uliochapishwa mwaka 2020 na Common Sense Media ulibaini kuwa  asilimia 50 ya vijana katika jimbo la Los Angeles walisema wasingeweza kukaa bila kutumia simu janja zao .	a study published in 2020 by common sense media found that 50% of young people in the state of los angeles said they could not stay without using their smartphones.
160	The risk inherent in our use of such technology was recently openly acknowledged by insiders from the industry in the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, which includes testimonials from former employees of Big Tech  including Google, Twitter and Facebook  explaining how they purposefully nurtured user addiction for profit.	Madhara yatokanayo na matumizi ya teknolojia hizi hivi karibuni yaliwekwa bayana na vyanzo vya kuaminika katika makala ya Netflix ya  The Social Dilemma, ambayoinayoelezea ushuhuda wa wafanyakazi wa zamani wa kampuni kubwa zikiwemo Google, Twitter na Facebook  wanaoelezea ni kwa namna gani walivyokuwa wanaweka mazingira ya kushawishi mtumiaji kujenga uraibu wa vutumizi kwa minajili ya vipato.	the harms resulting from the use of these technologies were recently made clear by credible sources in the netflix article the social dilemma, which describes the testimony of former employees of large companies including google, twitter and facebook, explaining how they were creating an environment to persuade the user to build an addiction for the sake of income.
161	Some governments have reacted by upgrading protective legislation in order to both raise user awareness and place more responsibility on technology companies.	Baadhi ya serikali zimejaribu kukabiliana na tatizo hili kwa kuboresha sheria ili kujenga uelewa wa watumiaji sambamba na kuongeza uwajibikaji kwa makampuni husika.	some governments have tried to address this problem by improving laws to enhance consumer awareness and increase accountability for the relevant companies.
162	In May 2018, the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).	Mwaka 2018, Umoja wa Ulaya (EU) ulipitisha  Sheria Mama ya Ulinzi wa Taarifa (GDPR).	in 2018, the european union (eu) adopted the general data protection regulation (gdpr).
163	The law adds multiple constraints to data management, such as asking users for explicit authorization for the use of their data and requiring companies to remove this data after a period of three years without interaction.	Sheria hii imeongeza matakwa kadhaa kuhusu utunzaji wa taarifa ikiwamo kupata ridhaa isiyo na shaka ya mtumiaji kuhusu taarifa zake na kuyataka makampuni husika kuondoa taarifa hizi baada ya kipindi cha miaka mitatu bila kushurutishwa.	this law has added several requirements regarding data handling, including obtaining the user's unequivocal consent about his information and requiring the companies involved to remove this information after a period of three years without being forced.
164	It also introduces extremely large fines for those who do not respect these rules.	Pia, sheria hii imeweka fidia kubwa kwa wale ambao hawataheshimu kanuni hizi.	also, this law has set a large compensation for those who will not respect these rules.
165	But its enforcement is limited by a lack of resources to do so among local authorities, and it is, of course, only applicable in EU member states.	Hata hivyo, utekelezaji wake unakabiliwa na ukosefu wa vitendea kazi katika mamlaka za serikali, na pia, sheria hii inayahusu tu mataifa wanachama wa Umoja wa Ulaya.	however, its implementation is faced with a lack of tools in government authorities, and also, this law only applies to member states of the european union.
166	A tool to empower users	Nyenzo ya kuwawezesha watumiaji wa teknolojia ya habari	the strategy to enable users of information technology
167	This current climate convinced Duval of the need to create a tool that would allow people to take control of their own data, as he explains:	Kwa jinsi hali ya mambo ilivyo sasa, Duval alishawishika kuandaa nyenzo itakayowawezesha watu kuchukua jukumu la kulinda taarifa zao wenyewe, kama anavyoelezea:	given the current state of affairs, duval was persuaded to prepare a tool that would enable people to take responsibility for protecting their own information, as he explains:
168	Our slogan is Your data is YOUR data, because our personal data belongs to us, and those who pretend that it shouldn't are either against freedom and democracy, or they have a business that is fuelled by advertising  because personal data can help sell ads at a much higher price.	Motto wetu ni kuwa Taarifa zako ni zako, kwa kuwa taarifa zetu ni mali yetu, na kwa wale wanaodhani kuwa haipaswi kuwa hivyo, hawataki uhuru na amani, au wanamiliki biashara inayoneemeshwa kwa matangazo- kwa kuwa taarifa binafsi za mtu zinaweza kusaidia kuuza matangazo kwa bei ghali zaidi.	our motto is that your information is yours, because our information is our property, and for those who think it should not be so, they do not want freedom and peace, or they own a business that benefits from advertising - because a person's personal information can help sell ads at a higher price.
169	This is how the OS he created operates:	Hivi ndivyo mfumo endeshi aliouunda unavyofanya kazi:	this is how the operating system he created works:
170	/e/ is a digital ecosystem that provides a smartphone operating system that doesn't send [to Google] any piece of your personal data, like your searches, your geolocation and that respects users data privacy.	/e/ ni mfumo endeshi msawazo wa kidigitali wa simu janja ambao hautumi taarifa yoyote [kwenda Google] kama vile unapoperuzi, mahali ulipo na unaozingatia faragha ya mtumiaji.	/e/ is a digital smartphone operating system that does not use any information [going to google] such as when you browse, where you are, and respects the user's privacy.
171	It doesn't look at the user's data for any purpose.	Mfumo huu haukagui kwa namna yoyote taarifa binafsi za mtumiaji.	this system does not discriminate in any way the personal information of the user.
172	It also provides basic online services such as an email address, some storage, a calendar, a way to store your contacts  everything linked with the smartphone operating system.	Unatoa pia huduma za msingi   za mtandaoni kama vile barua pepe, hifadhi, kalenda, kuhifadhi mawasiliano  kila kitu kinachohusiana na mfumo endeshi wa simu janja.	you also provide basic online services such as email, storage, calendar, saving contacts, everything related to the smartphone operating system.
173	Duval said that when it comes to personal data, Google and Apple are in the same boat  this data fuels Google's business model, which is essentially based on selling advertising, while Apple, despite claiming to protect its users privacy, receives an estimated 8 billion to 12 billion US dollars each year to pre-install Google search on iPhones and iPads.	Duval anasema kwamba, linapokuja suala la taarifa binafsi za mtu, Google na Apple wana malengo yanayofanana  taarifa hizi zinapalilia mfumo wa kibiashara wa Google, ambao kimsingi unategemea  bilioni 8 hadi 12 kila mwaka kwa ajili ya kuweka kitumizi cha kuperuzi cha Google kwenye iPhones na iPads.	duval says that, when it comes to a person's private information, google and apple have similar objectives. this information fuels google's business system, which essentially relies on 8 to 12 billion every year to keep the google browsing application on iphones and ipads.
174	Duval added:	Duval aliongeza:	duval added:
175	Using an iPhone, a user sends about 6MB of personal data to Google, per day.	Kwa kutumia iPhone, mtumiaji anatuma wastani wa MB 6 za taarifa zake kwenda Google,  kwa siku.	by using an iphone, the user sends an average of 6 mb of their data to google, per day.
176	It's double [that amount] for Android users.	Ni mara mbili ya kiasi kinachotumwa na watumiaji wa mfumo endeshi wa Android.	it's twice the amount sent by users of the android operating system.
177	Besides, Apple hardware is a closed box, without any transparency about what's happening inside.	Mbali na hivyo, mfumo wa nje wa Apple umefungwa vilivyo, na kukosekana kabisa kwa uwazi wa kinachoendelea ndani.	apart from that, apple's external system is tightly closed, with a complete lack of transparency about what is going on inside.
178	You have to trust them.	Yapaswa tu kuwaamini.	we should just trust them.
179	We, on the other hand, support auditable privacy: all the /e/OS and the cloud software source code (the recipe for building the products) is open-source.	Sisi kwa upande wetu,  tunaruhusu kubadilisha sera ya faragha: mifumo yote ya /e/OS na nyenzo za matengenezo za hifadhi ya mtandaoni (vitu vilivyotumiwa katika uundaji wa mfumo huu) zinapatikana bure.	for our part, we allow changes to the privacy policy: all /e/os systems and online storage maintenance tools (things used in the creation of this system) are available for free.
180	It can be challenged by specialists and audited.	Mfumo huu unaweza kuhojiwa na kukaguliwa na wataalam.	this system can be interrogated and inspected by experts.
181	In a context of growing dependence on smartphones, it is clear that protective legislation is not enough to raise awareness and equip users with the right tools and knowledge to protect their data privacy  and this is where a digital tool that makes users more responsible and proactive can play an important role.	Katika mazingira ya ongezeko kubwa la matumizi ya simu janja,  ni dhahiri kuwa sheria pekee hazitoshi katika kujenga uelewa na kuwapatia watumiaji nyenzo sahihi na maarifa ya kulinda taarifa zao  na hapa ndipo unapokuja umuhimu wa nyenzo za kidigitali zinazowasaidia watumiaji kuwajibika zaidi	in the context of the significant increase in smartphone usage, it is clear that laws alone are not enough in building awareness and providing users with the right tools and knowledge to protect their information, and this is where the importance of digital tools that help users be more accountable comes in.
182	Information and awareness is important to prevent the spread of COVID-19.	Taarifa na uelewa ni muhimu katika kujikinga na maambukizi ya UVIKO-19.	information and understanding are important in protecting against covid-19 infections.
183	Here in Kenya, clinical health care workers are sensitising the community on COVID-19.	Picha inawaonesha wafanyakazi wa afya nchini Kenya wakielimisha jamii kuhusu maambukizi ya UVIKO-19.	the picture shows health workers in kenya educating the community about covid-19 infections.

185	Kenyas COVID-19 vaccination rollout has been mired by allegations of bribery, line cutting and corruption that have left poor and elderly citizens waiting in long queues outside public hospitals even as the country grapples with a third wave of infections and deaths.	Kuanza kutolewa kwa chanjo ya UVIKO-19 nchini Kenya kumegubikwa na tuhuma za vitendo vya rushwa, upendeleo na ufisadi ambavyo vimewaacha wananchi wengi masikini na wazee wakisubiri kwenye mistari mirefu nje ya hospitali za umma wakati huu ambao nchi hiyo inakabiliwa na mlipuko wa tatu wa maambukizi na vifo vinavyotokana na UVIKO-19.	the rollout of the covid-19 vaccine in kenya has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption, favoritism and fraud, leaving many poor and elderly citizens waiting in long lines outside public hospitals at a time when the country is facing a third wave of infections and deaths from covid-19.
186	Meanwhile, hundreds of well-connected Kenyans are paying anything up to $100 to secretly receive early inoculations, as documented through eyewitness accounts by various Kenyans online and news coverage in Kenyan and international media.	Wakati huo huo, mamia ya Wakenya wanalipa kiasi cha hadi dola 100 ili waweze kuitwa mapema, kama ilivyoelezwa kwenye akaunti kadhaa za Wakenya mtandaoni sambamba na vyombo vya habari vya Kenya na vile vya kimataifa.	at the same time, hundreds of kenyans are paying up to $100 so they can be called early, as described in several kenyan online accounts alongside kenyan and international media outlets.
187	In early March, Kenya procured over 1 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine doses through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access initiative, a World Health Organization-backed global vaccine distribution effort known as COVAX.	Mapema mwezi Machi, Kenya ilinunua zaidi ya dozi milioni 1 za chanjo ya Oxford-AstraZeneca kupitia mpango wa Upatikanaji wa Chanjo ya UVIKO-19 Duniani, inayoratibiwa na Shirika la Afya Duniani kupitia utaratibu unaoitwa COVAX.	in early march, kenya purchased more than 1 million doses of the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine through the global covid-19 vaccine access plan, coordinated by the world health organization through a mechanism called covax.
188	The delivery marked the start of a campaign to offer the vaccine free of charge at select public and private hospitals.	Kupokelewa kwa chanjo hizo kulianzisha kampeni ya kutoa chanjo bure katika hospitali teule za umma na binafsi.	the reception of those vaccines initiated a campaign to provide free vaccinations in selected public and private hospitals.
189	The rollout was broken down into three phases: healthcare workers and security and immigration officials, citizens over age 58 and adults with certain medical conditions, and other citizens in vulnerable conditions such as those living in informal settlements.	Kutolewa kwa dawa hizo kuligawanywa katika hatua tatu: watumishi wa afya na maafisa usalama na uhamiaji, wananchi wenye umri zaidi ya miaka 58 na watu wazima wenye changamoto mbalimbali za afya, na wananchi wengine wanaoishi kwenye mazingira hatarishi kama wale wanaoishi kwenye makazi yasiyo rasmi.	the distribution of those drugs was divided into three stages: health workers and security and immigration officers, citizens over the age of 58 and adults with various health challenges, and other citizens living in risky environments such as those living in informal settlements.
190	The country is set to receive 24 million doses through COVAX.	Nchi hiyo inategemea kupokea dozi milioni 24 kupitia utaratibu wa  COVAX.	that country expects to receive 24 million doses through the covax mechanism.
191	It plans to vaccinate 50 percent of the population by June 2022 through a combination of COVAX vaccines and donations from other countries, reports The Washington Post.	Kwa mujibu wa jarida la The Washington Post, Kenya inalenga kuchanja asimilia 50 ya wananchi wake ifikapo Juni 2022 kwa ushirikiano kati ya mradi wa COVAX na misaada kutoka mataifa mengine.	according to the washington post, kenya aims to vaccinate 50 percent of its citizens by june 2022 in collaboration with the covax project and aid from other countries.
192	In a press release, UNICEF Representative to Kenya Maniza Zaman celebrated the arrival of the first vaccines in Kenya.	Kwenye taarifa yake kwa vyombo vya habari, Mwakilishi wa UNICEF nchini Kenya Maniza Zaman alipongeza kuwasili kwa chanjo za kwanza nchini Kenya.	in her statement to the media, unicef representative in kenya maniza zaman praised the arrival of the first vaccines in kenya.
193	With the arrival of these vaccines, UNICEF and partners are honouring the promise of the COVAX facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the global rollout of life-saving vaccines, she said.	Kufuatilia kuwasili kwa chanjo hizi, UNICEF na washirika wake wanapongeza ahadi ya COVAX kuhakikisha kuwa watu wanaotoka kwenye nchi zisizo na uwezo mkubwa kiuchumi hawaachwi nyuma kwenye mpango huu wa kimataifa wa kuokoa maisha ya watu kwa chanjo, alisema.	following the arrival of these vaccines, unicef and its partners are applauding covax's commitment to ensuring that people from economically disadvantaged countries are not left behind in this global life-saving vaccination program, he said.
194	However, this elaborately planned three-phase rollout fell apart as soon as the exercise began because of a last-minute government decision to fast-track phase two in response to the third wave, conflicting politically charged interests, and the states failure to consult and inform citizens.	Hata hivyo, mpango huu wa tatu ulivurugika mara baada ya zoezi kuanza kwa sababu ya uamuzi wa dakika za mwisho wa kuharakisha awamu ya pili ya mpango huyo kama namna ya kukabiliana na wimbi la tatu la maambukizi, maslahi ya kisiasa yanayokinzana, na serikali kushindwa kuwasiliana na kuwajulisha wananchi.	however, this third plan was disrupted immediately after the exercise began due to a last-minute decision to expedite the second phase of the plan as a way to deal with the third wave of infections, conflicting political interests, and the government's failure to communicate and inform the citizens.
195	In his article questioning what is going on with Kenyas COVID-19 vaccine drive, Patrick Gathara, a Nairobi-based writer and award-winning political cartoonist noted:	Katika makala yake inayohoji kile kinachoendelea kwenye mpango wa chanjo ya UVIKO-19 nchini Kenya, Patrick Gathara, mwandishi anayeishi Kenya na mchoraji wa katuni za siasa aliyepata tuzo mbali mbali alisema:	in his article questioning what is happening in the covid-19 vaccination program in kenya, patrick gathara, a writer living in kenya and an award-winning political cartoonist, said:
196	Politicians loudly and self-servingly argued that they should be given priority to inspire confidence among the population, even though the Ministry of Health was reporting encountering little resistance.	Kwa sauti kubwa na ubinafsi, wanasiasa walidai kwamba wao ndio wanaopaswa kupewa kipaumbele ili kuwajengea imani wananchi, ingawa Wizara ya Afya tayari ilisharipoti kutokuwepo kwa upinzani mkubwa wa chanjo hiyo.	with loud voices and selfishness, politicians claimed that they should be given priority to build trust with the citizens, even though the ministry of health had already reported the absence of significant opposition to the vaccine.
197	Because the state had ignored the need to explain its plan to the population, there was widespread confusion about where and when people were expected to be in line.	Kwa kuwa serikali imepuuza takwa la kueleza mpango wake kwa wananchi, kulikuwa na mkanganyiko mkubwa kuhusu wapi na lini watu wanatarajiwa kusimama kwenye mstari.	since the government ignored the requirement to explain its plan to the citizens, there was great confusion about where and when people were expected to line up.
198	Despite government directives prioritizing citizens over the age of 58, Kenyan media reported that businessmen and politicians not in this age group have found a way to get the jab early, exposing the country's rich-poor divide.	Pamoja na maelekezo ya serikali  kuwapa kipaumbele wananchi wenye umri wa zaidi ya miaka 58,  vyombo vya habari nchini Kenya viliripoti kwamba wafanyabiashara na wanasiasa wasio kwenye kundi la umri huu wamekuwa wakipata huduma kinyume na utaratibu, hali inayoonesha ubaguzi mkubwa wa masikini unaofanywa na wenye fedha.	despite the government's directive to prioritize citizens over the age of 58, media outlets in kenya reported that businessmen and politicians not in this age group have been receiving services contrary to the procedure, a situation that shows a great discrimination against the poor by the wealthy.
199	Meanwhile, eligible senior citizens and poor Kenyans, who aren't well connected and don't have money to pay a bribe, often wait in line all day starting at 5 a.m., only to be asked to return the following day because the doses are finished, according to The Washington Post.	Wakati huo huo, wazee wanaostahili na Wakenya maskini, ambao hawana mtandao wa watu wa kuwasaidia na wasio na fedha za kuhonga,  huonekana wakingoja kwenye mstari siku zote kuanzia saa 11 alfajiri, na kuishia kuombwa warudi siku nyingine kwa sababu dawa zimeisha, kwa mujibu wa habari iliyoandikwa na jarida la The Washington Post.	meanwhile, deserving elders and poor kenyans, who lack a network of people to help them and do not have money for bribes, are often seen waiting in line all day starting from 11 in the morning, and end up being asked to return another day because the medicine has run out, according to a report written by the washington post.
200	They have another door for their friends, Mary Njoroge, 58, one of the teachers, told The Washington Post.	Wana mlango mwingine kwa marafiki zao, Mary Njoroge, 58, mmoja wa walimu, aliliambia The Washngton Post.	they have another door for their friends, mary njoroge, 58, one of the teachers, told the washington post.
201	Without a godfather to help you through this process, what are you supposed to do?	Bila kuwa na mtu wa kukusaidia kukamilisha mchakato wote, utafanya nini?	without someone to help you complete the whole process, what will you do?
202	A similar incident in another government hospital was reported by @_Sativa, a Twitter user based in Nairobi, Kenyan.	Tukio kama hilo liliripotiwa kwenye hospitali nyingine ya serikali na @_Sativa, mtumiaji wa Twita anayeishi Nairobi, ambaye pia ni Mkenya.	an event like that was reported in another government hospital by @_sativa, a twitter user living in nairobi, who is also kenyan.
203	In a Twitter thread, he recounted the experience of his aunt, a retired teacher in her 60s.	Kwenye uzi huo wa Twita, alielezea kile ambacho shangazi yake alikutana nacho, mwalimu mstaafu mwenye zaidi ya miaka 60.	in that twitter thread, he described what his aunt encountered, a retired teacher over 60 years old.
204	While elderly people waited in line, a nurse called out names and young people came to the front to get vaccinated.	Wakati wazee wakisubiri mstarini, muuguzi aliita majina na vijana walikuja mbele na wakatangulia kupata chanjo.	while the elders were waiting in line, the nurse called out names and the young people came forward and were the first to get vaccinated.
205	When his aunt asked what was happening, the nurse gave her a number where she could send money, he said in his Twitter thread.	Shangazi yake alipouliza nini kinaendelea, muuguzi alimpa namba [ya simu] ambayo angeweza kutumia fedha, alisema kwenye uzi huo wa Twitter.	when his aunt asked what was going on, the nurse gave her a phone number she could use to send money, he said in that twitter thread.
206	Following reports of increased enthusiasm from the public for the vaccination campaign, Kenyas Cabinet Secretary for Health, Mutahi Kagwe told the media:	Kufuatia taarifa za kuongezeka kwa hamasa ya watu kwa kampeni hiyo ya chanjo, Waziri wa Afya wa Kenya, Mutahi Kagwe aliviambia vyombo vya habari:	following reports of increasing public enthusiasm for the vaccination campaign, kenya's health minister, mutahi kagwe told the media:
207	I think somewhere along the line we seem to have developed some confusion that anybody can walk into a vaccination centre and get vaccines.	Nadhani tumefika mahali tumetengeneza hali ya sintofahamu kwamba mtu yeyote anaweza kwenda kwenye kituo cha kutolea chanjo na kupata huduma.	i think we have reached a point where we have created confusion that anyone can go to the vaccination center and get service.
208	I want to make it very clear, those carrying out vaccination will have to account for every dose that they have used and that dose that they have used must be matched against an eligible person.	Ninataka kuliweka suala hili vizuri, wale wanaotoa huduma ya chanjo watatoa hesabu ya kila dawa waliyoitumia na kwamba dawa zilizotumika lazima zioanishwe na mtu anayestahili huduma hiyo.	i want to put this matter straight, those who provide vaccination services will give an account of every drug they have used and that the drugs used must be matched with the person deserving that service.
209	The National Nurses Association of Kenya president Alfred Obengo pleaded with Kenyans who are not on the priority list to avoid queuing for the vaccine.	Rais wa Chama cha Taifa cha Wauguzi nchini Kenya Alfred Obengo aliwaomba Wakenya wasio kwenye orodha ya kipaumbele kuepuka kusimama kwenye foleni ya chanjo.	the president of the national nurses association of kenya, alfred obengo, asked kenyans not on the priority list to avoid standing in the vaccination queue.
210	In providing clarity on how the Kenyan government could have avoided this confusion in its rollout plan, Gathara concludes his article by saying:	Akifafanua namna serikali ya Kenya ingeweza kuepuka mkanganyiko huo katika kutekeleza mpango huo,  Gathara anahitimisha makala yake kwa kusema:	explaining how the kenyan government could have avoided that confusion in implementing the plan, gathara concludes his article by saying:
211	Much of this could have been avoided if the Kenyan government and its global partners, including the World Health Organization and Western governments, treated Kenyans as partners in the rollout rather than colonial subjects to be brutalised and exploited.	Tungeweza kuepuka kadhia hii kama serikali ya Kenya na washirika wake duniani, ikiwa ni pamoja na Shirika la Afya Duniani na serikali za nchi za magharibi, zingefanya kazi na Kenya kama mbia wa mpango huu na sio koloni linalotendewa ukatili na kunyonywa.	we could have avoided this problem if the kenyan government and its global partners, including the world health organization and western governments, worked with kenya as a partner in this program and not as a colony that is being mistreated and exploited.
212	Sadly for Kenyans, their colonial state does not know how to act any differently.	Inasikitisha sana kwa Wakenya, nchi yao ambayo ni koloni haifahamu namna nyingine ya kufanya.	it is very sad for kenyans, their country which is a colony does not know any other way to operate.
213	Last December, the world's eyes were riveted on Argentina as abortion was legalized in that country.	Mwezi Desemba mwaka jana, dunia yote ilijielekeza nchini Argentina ambako utoaji mimba uliruhusiwa rasmi kisheria nchini humo.	in december last year, the whole world turned its attention to argentina where abortion was officially legalized in the country.
214	But to what extent are girls and women being forced to become mothers in other parts of the world?	Lakini je, ni kwa kiwango gani wasichana na wanawake wanalazimishwa kuwa wazazi katika sehemu nyingine duniani?	but to what extent are girls and women forced to become parents in other parts of the world?

233	In early March, as Tanzanians began to speculate about the health and location of President John Magufuli, many citizens took to social media with their queries and concerns.	Mwanzoni mwa mwezi Machi, wakati wa-Tanzania walipoanza kuhoji afya na mahali alipo Rais John Magufuli, raia wengi walitumia mitandao ya kijamii kuuliza maswali na hata kuonesha wasiwasi wao.	at the beginning of march, when tanzanians began questioning the health and whereabouts of president john magufuli, many citizens used social media to ask questions and even express their concerns.
234	In response, the government issued threats of mass arrests to anyone who used social media to share false information about the president.	Katika kujibu maswali hayo, serikali ilitishia kumkamata mtu yeyote aliyetumia mitandao ya kijamii kusambaza taarifa potofu kuhusu rais.	in response to those questions, the government threatened to arrest anyone who used social media to spread false information about the president.
235	Authorities swiftly referred to Tanzanias 2015 Cybercrimes Act, and the 2020 Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations (EPOCA) to arrest and detain those who violated its rules.	Mamlaka za serikali zilirejea Sheria ya Makosa ya Mtandao ya Tanzania ya mwaka 2015 na Kanuni za Mawasiliano ya Kieletroniki na Posta (Maudhui ya Mtandao) (EPOCA) zilizotungwa mwaka 2020 kuelezea uwezekano wa kuwakamata na kuwaweka ndani wote waliovunja sheria hizo.	the government authorities referred back to the tanzanian cybercrimes act of 2015 and the electronic and postal communications (online content) (epoca) regulations enacted in 2020 to explain the possibility of arresting and detaining all those who violated these laws.
236	The government has often used cybercrime laws and online content regulations to undermine and clamp down on digital rights and freedom of expression in Tanzania, this time was no different.	Huu ulikuwa ni mwendelezo wa hatua za serikali, ambayo mara kadhaa, imetumia sheria za makosa ya mtandao na kanuni za maudhui ya mtandaoni kudhibiti na kubana haki za kidijitali na uhuru wa maoni nchini Tanzania.	this was a continuation of the government's actions, which several times, has used cybercrime laws and online content regulations to control and suppress digital rights and freedom of expression in tanzania.
237	On March 17, then-Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan revealed on state TV that John Magufuli had died.	Mnamo Machi 17, aliyekuwa Makamu wa Rais Samia Suluhu Hassan alitangaza kwenye televisheni ya taifa kwamba John Magufuli amefariki.	on march 17, former vice president samia suluhu hassan announced on national television that john magufuli had died.
238	Soon after, Hassan was sworn in as the sixth president of Tanzania.	Siku chache baadae, Hassan aliapishwa kuwa rais wa sita wa Tanzania.	a few days later, hassan was sworn in as the sixth president of tanzania.
239	By then, at least four people had been arrested in different parts of the country for spreading false rumors about Magufulis health and location.	Hadi wakati huo,  watu wasiopungua wanne walikuwa wamekamatwa katika maeneo mbalimbali ya nchi kwa kosa la kusambaza uvumi wa uongo kuhusu afya na mahali aliko Magufuli.	until then, no fewer than four people had been arrested in various parts of the country for spreading false rumors about magufuli's health and whereabouts.
240	Many now wonder if Tanzania will review its repressive online content regulations in a post-Magufuli world, or whether these laws will remain firmly in place until 2025- the remainder of Magufuli's term served by Hassan.	Wengi hivi sasa wanajiuliza ikiwa Tanzania itapitia upya kanuni zake zinazodhibiti maudhui ya mtandaoni baada ya utawala wa Magufuli, au ikiwa sheria hizi zitaendelea kutumika mpaka mwaka 2025  kipindi cha Magufuli kilichobaki kitakachokamilishwa na Rais Samia Hassan.	many are now wondering whether tanzania will review its regulations controlling online content after the magufuli administration, or if these laws will continue to be used until 2025, the remaining period of magufuli's term to be completed by president samia hassan.
241	In early March, Innocent Bashungwa, Tanzanias Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, issued a warning specifically to the media to desist from spreading rumors about Magufulis whereabouts, who had not been seen in the public eye since February 27.	Mapema mwezi Machi, Innocent Bashungwa, Waziri wa Habari, Utamaduni, Sanaa na Michezo wa Tanzania, alitoa tahadhari kwa vyombo vya habari kuepuka kusambaza uvumi kuhusu  aliko Magufuli, ambaye wakati huo alikuwa hajaonekana hadharani tangu Februari 27.	in early march, innocent bashungwa, tanzania's minister of information, culture, arts and sports, warned media outlets to avoid spreading rumors about the whereabouts of magufuli, who at that time had not been seen in public since february 27.
242	Additionally, the Minister of Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Mwigulu Nchemba, also threatened netizens with jail time via his Twitter account for sharing nonsense rumors, specifically citing Section 89 of the Penal Code and Section 16 of the Cybercrimes Act.	Aidha, Waziri wa Sheria na Mambo ya Katiba, Mwigulu Nchemba, pia aliwatishia watumiaji wa mitandao adhabu ya kifungo kupitia akaunti yake ya Twita kwa kosa la kusambaza uvumi wa kijinga, akirejea Kifungu cha 89 cha Kanuni za Adhabu na Kifungu cha 16 cha Sheria ya Makosa ya Mtandao.	furthermore, the minister of justice and constitutional affairs, mwigulu nchemba, also threatened social media users with imprisonment through his twitter account for the offense of spreading foolish rumors, referring to section 89 of the penal code and section 16 of the cybercrimes act.
243	Police Chief Ramadhani Kingai expressed specific interest in the Twitter account of Kigogo, a Swahili name referring to a high-ranking official, who often exposes government wrongdoing.	Mkuu wa Polisi Ramadhani Kingai alionesha nia ya kutaka kuifahamu akaunti ya Twita yenye jina la Kigogo, ambayo kwa muda mrefu imejipambanua kuanika mabaya ya serikali.	police chief ramadhani kingai expressed interest in understanding the twitter account named kigogo, which for a long time has distinguished itself by exposing the government's wrongdoings.
244	Human rights activists have condemned these moves and the overall climate of fear created by these regulations and subsequent threats of enforcement.	Wanaharakati wa haki za binadamu wameshutumu hatua hizi zinazochukuliwa na maafisa wa serikali na hali ya woga inayojengwa na kanuni hizi sambamba na vitisho vinavyoambatana na utekelezaji wake.	human rights activists have condemned these actions taken by government officials and the fear being instilled by these regulations, along with the threats associated with their implementation.
245	EPOCA 2020: Further restrictions on digital rights	Kanuni za Maudhui ya Mtandaoni: Kubanwa zaidi kwa haki za kidijitali	online content rules: increased restrictions on digital rights
246	Tanzania has experienced remarkable internet, communications and technological advancements over the last decade.	Kwa zaidi ya muongo mmoja uliopita, Tanzania imefurahia mtandao madhubuti na maendeleo makubwa ya mawasiliano na teknolojia.	for more than a decade, tanzania has enjoyed a robust network and significant developments in communication and technology.
247	Nevertheless, the state often plays an influential role over Tanzanian media companies and platforms and independent media lacks diversity in terms of viewpoints and representation.	Pamoja na maendeleo hayo, serikali imekuwa ikijiwekea mazingira ya kudhibiti makampuni na majukwaa ya majadiliano na kwa sababu hiyo vyombo huru vya habari vinashindwa kujipambanua  kwa maana ya aina ya maoni yanayochapishwa na sura ya uwakilishi wake.	despite these developments, the government has been creating an environment to control companies and discussion platforms, and for this reason, independent media outlets fail to distinguish themselves in terms of the type of opinions published and the nature of their representation.
248	The internet created new spaces online for Tanzanias young bloggers and social media activists to make their voices heard, but the government has not welcomed this new reality.	Mtandao wa Intaneti umetengeneza jukwaa jipya mtandaoni kwa wanablogu vijana wa Tanzania na wanaharakati wanaotumia mitandao ya kijamii kupaza sauti zao, lakini serikali haionekani kukubaliana na ukweli huu mpya.	the internet has created a new online platform for young tanzanian bloggers and activists using social media to raise their voices, but the government does not seem to agree with this new reality.
249	In 2010, Tanzania first published the Electronic and Postal Communications Act, the first of its kind in the country.	Mwaka 2010, Tanzania ilichapisha Sheria ya Mawasiliano ya Kieletroniki na Posta, ambayo ilikuwa ya aina yake nchini humo.	in 2010, tanzania published the electronic and postal communications act, which was the first of its kind in the country.
250	By 2018, specific regulations regarding online content were released through Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations, 2018.	Kufikia 2018, kanuni mahususi zinazodhibiti maudhui ya mtandaoni zilitolewa kupitia Kanuni za Mawasiliano ya Kieletroniki na Posta (Maudhui ya Mtandaoni) 2018.	by 2018, specific regulations controlling online content were issued through the electronic and postal communications (online content) regulations 2018.
251	The government argued that these regulations were intended to monitor and regulate citizens use of social media, in particular, and tackle issues like hate speech and disinformation.	Serikali ilidai kwamba kanuni hizi zililenga kufuatilia kwa karibu matumizi ya mitandao ya kijamii, hususani, kupambana na tatizo la habari zinazoeneza chuki na uzushi mitandaoni.	the government claimed that these regulations were aimed at closely monitoring the use of social networks, specifically, to combat the problem of hate speech and online misinformation.
252	However, the regulations applied not only to mainstream media but to individual bloggers and content providers, who were shocked by the new requirement to pay $900 United States dollars for a license.	Hata hivyo, kanuni hizo si tu zilitumika dhidi ya vyombo vikuu vya habari lakini pia kwa wanablogu mmoja mmoja na watoa huduma za maudhui, ambao walishangazwa na takwa jipya la kisheria la kulipa kiasi cha dola za Marekani 900  ili kupata leseni.	however, these rules were not only used against major media outlets but also against individual bloggers and content providers, who were surprised by the new legal requirement to pay an amount of 900 us dollars to obtain a license.
253	This includes anyone who produces live-streaming TV or radio.	Takwa hili pia lilimhusu yeyote anayetayarisha na kurusha mubashara matangazo ya televisheni au radio mtandaoni.	this caution also applied to anyone preparing and broadcasting live television or radio broadcasts online.
254	The sudden imposition of fees turned Tanzanian social media dark as many bloggers and content providers gave up due to the exorbitant costs.	Giza kubwa lilitanda kwenye mitandao ya kijamii kufuatia takwa hili la ghafla la ada ambapo wanablogu wengi na wazalishaji wa maudhui waliamua kuachana na shughuli zao kwa sababu ya gharama hizo kubwa.	a great darkness spread on social media following this sudden demand for fees, where many bloggers and content producers decided to abandon their activities due to these high costs.
255	Opposition politicians and social media practitioners critiqued the regulations for undermining online media freedoms as well as civil society.	Wanasiasa wa upinzani na watumiaji wa mitandao ya kijamii walikosoa vikali kanuni hizi kwa kupoka uhuru wa mitandao ya kijamii pamoja na asasi za kiraia.	opposition politicians and social media users strongly criticized these rules for infringing on the freedom of social media and civil society organizations.
256	In 2020, Tanzania released revised EPOCA regulations, issued under Section 103 of the Electronic and Postal Communication Act, 2010, adopted in July 2020, and announced through Government Gazette on Government Notice No. 538.	Mwaka 2020, Tanzania ilitoa marekebisho mapya ya kanuni za maudhui ya mtandaoni, chini ya kifungu cha 103 cha Sheria ya Mawasiliano ya Kieletroniki na Posta, 2020, na kuanza kutumika Julai 2020, na kuzitangaza kupitia Tangazo Na 538 katika Gazeti la Serikali.	in 2020, tanzania issued new amendments to the online content regulations, under section 103 of the electronic and postal communications act, 2020, and began to apply them in july 2020, announcing them through announcement no. 538 in the government gazette.
257	There are several main differences between the 2018 and 2020 versions of EPOCA.	Baadhi ya tofauti kubwa kati ya toleo la 2018 na 2020  la Kanuni za Maudhui ya Mtandaoni o (EPOCA) ni kama ifuatavyo:	some of the major differences between the 2018 and 2020 versions of the online content regulations (epoca) are as follows:
258	Firstly, the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) recategorized fees with three additional sub-categories under online content: news & current affairs, entertainment and education or religious, furthering imposing restrictions on individual content providers.	Kwanza, Mamlaka ya Mawasiliano Tanzania (TCRA) ilitengeneza upya makundi ya ada na kuongeza makundi madogo chini ya maudhui ya mtandaoni yaani: taarifa & habari, burudani na elimu au dini, na kuendelea kuzuia watu binafsi kutoa maudhui.	first, the tanzania communications regulatory authority (tcra) restructured the fee categories and added subcategories under online content namely: news & information, entertainment and education or religion, and continued to prevent individuals from providing content.
259	EPOCA 2020, Part VI, Section 116:	Kanuni ya Maudhui Mtandaoni ya 2020, Sehemu VI, Kifungu cha 116:	the 2020 online content regulations, section vi, article 116:
260	Any person who provides network services without obtaining any relevant individual license, commits an offense and shall be liable upon conviction to a fine of not less than 6 million Tanzanian shillings [ $2,587 United States dollars] or imprisonment for a term not less than 12 months or to both.	Mtu yeyote anayetoa huduma za mtandao bila kupata leseni muafaka, anafanya kosa na adhabu yake ni hukumu ya kulipa faini isiyopungua Shilingi za Kitanzania milioni 6 [dola za marekani 2,587] au kifungo cha jela kisichopungua miezi 12 au vyote kwa pamoja.	anyone who provides internet services without obtaining the appropriate license commits an offense and the penalty is a fine of not less than 6 million tanzanian shillings [$2,587 us dollars] or imprisonment for not less than 12 months or both.
261	Secondly, the TCRA expanded a more detailed list of prohibited content including, among other things, content that motivates or promotes phone tapping, espionage, data theft, tracking, recording or intercepting communications or conversation without right.	Pili, TCRA iliongeza orodha ya maudhui yasiyoruhusiwa na kujumuisha, pamoja na mambo mengine, maudhui yanayohamasisha kurekodi simu za watu, kupeleleza mawasiliano, kuiba data, kufuatilia mawasiliano, kurekodi na kuingilia mawasiliano au mazungumzo bila ruhusa.	secondly, tcra expanded the list of prohibited content to include, among other things, content that encourages recording people's phone calls, spying on communications, stealing data, tracking communications, recording and interfering with communications or conversations without permission.
262	Thirdly, EPOCA 2020 also reduced the amount of time that a license-holder has to respond to prohibited content violations by suspending or terminating an account.	Tatu, Kanuni za Maudhui ya Mtandaoni (EPOCA 2020) pia zimepunguza kipindi ambacho mwenye leseni anaweza kufanyia kazi ukiukwaji wa kanuni za maudhui kwa kusimamishwa au kufutiwa akaunti.	three, the online content regulations (epoca 2020) have also reduced the period in which a licensee can work on content rule violations by being suspended or having their account deleted.
263	Under 2018 guidelines, a license-holder had 12 hours.	Chini ya kanuni za 2018, mwenye leseni alikuwa na saa 12 za kufanya hivyo.	under the 2018 rules, the licensee had 12 hours to do so.
264	In 2020, under Part III, Section 11, the response time is reduced to two hours.	Lakini kwenye kanuni za 2020, chini ya Sehemu ya III, kifungu cha 11, muda wa kushughulikia ukiukwaji wowote wa maudhui ulipunguzwa na kuwa saa 2.	but in the 2020 rules, under section iii, article 11, the time to handle any content violation was reduced to 2 hours.
265	Failure to comply within this time frame gives authorities permission to intervene, either by suspending or removing an account.	Kushindwa kuheshimu muda huu kunaipa mamlaka ruhusa ya kuingilia, ama kwa kuifungia au kuiondoa akaunti husika.	failing to respect this time gives the authority permission to intervene, either by locking or removing the relevant account.
266	Global Voices spoke with several legal and human rights experts who have condemned EPOCA 2020 revisions, saying it undermines both digital rights and civil society protections.	Global Voices ilizungumza na baadhi ya wataalam wa sheria na haki za binadamu ambao walikosoa marekebisho ya Kanuni za Maudhui ya 2020, wakisema yanabana haki za kidijitali na haki za asasi za kiraia.	global voices spoke with some legal and human rights experts who criticized the amendments to the 2020 content regulations, saying they restrict digital rights and civil society rights.
267	They argue that these regulations further repress digital rights and deter bloggers and writers from owning their online content.	Walisema kuwa kanuni hizi zinabana haki za kidijitali na kuwazuia wanablogu na waandishi kumiliki maudhui ya mtandaoni.	they said that these rules infringe on digital rights and prevent bloggers and writers from owning online content.
268	The biggest problem here is that these powers contain no safeguards against abuse, and with the current situation, they certainly have the effect of stifling legitimate freedom of expression in Tanzania, said one human rights professional who asked to remain anonymous.	Tatizo kubwa hapa ni kwamba hakuna tahadhari zimeweka kuzuia mamlaka haya yasitumike vibaya, na kwa hali ilivyo hivi sasa, mamlaka haya yana madhara kwenye uhuru wa kujieleza kwa haki nchini Tanzania, alisema mmoja wa wataalam wa haki za binadamu aliyeomba asifahamike.	the big problem here is that no precautions have been put in place to prevent these powers from being misused, and as it stands now, these powers are detrimental to the freedom of expression in tanzania, said one human rights expert who asked not to be named.
269	Post-Magufuli: The future of digital rights in Tanzania	Baada ya Magufuli: Mustakabali wa haki za kidijitali Tanzania	after magufuli: the future of digital rights in tanzania
270	Under the Magufuli administration, civil, media and digital rights steadily declined with systematic restrictions on free speech online.	Chini ya utawala wa Magufuli, asasi za kiraia, vyombo vya habari na haki za kidijitali zimekuwa zikizorota kwa kasi kufuatia kubanwa, hatua kwa hatua, kwa uhuru wa maoni mtandaoni.	under magufuli's administration, civil society, media and digital rights have been rapidly deteriorating following the gradual suppression of online freedom of expression.
271	In the aftermath of Magufulis unexpected death, many now wonder about the future of digital rights in the country  after six years of increasingly authoritarian-style leadership.	Baada ya kifo cha ghafla cha Magufuli, wengi sasa wanajiuliza kuhusu mustakabali wa haki za kidijitali nchini humo   baada ya miaka sita ya uongozi ulioendelea kuonesha dalili za mabavu.	after the sudden death of magufuli, many are now questioning the future of digital rights in the country after six years of leadership that continued to show signs of authoritarianism.
272	Global Voices spoke to several government officials on the condition of anonymity about the current regulations and whats at stake in terms of human rights in digital spaces.	Global Voices iliongea na baadhi ya maafisa wa serikali kwa sharti la kutokutajwa majina kuhusu kanuni mpya na  hali ya haki za binadamu na uhuru wa maoni mtandaoni.	global voices spoke with some government officials on condition of anonymity about new regulations and the state of human rights and freedom of expression online.
273	One human rights professional in Tanzania told Global Voices, on the condition of anonymity:	Mtaalam mmoja wa haki za biandamu nchini Tanzania aliiambia Global Voices, kwa sharti ya kutokutajwa:	one human rights expert in tanzania told global voices, on condition of anonymity:
274	The regulations are not fair as anyone can be criminalized, because not many citizens understand the implications of these regulations.	Kanuni hizi si za haki kwa sababu yeyote anaweza kutiwa hatiani, kwa kuwa si wananchi wengi wanaelewa tafsiri ya kanuni hizi.	these rules are not fair because anyone can be convicted, as many citizens do not understand the interpretation of these rules.
275	Another suggested that the government finds social media to be an annoyance.	Mwingine alifikiri kwamba serikali inachukulia mitandao ya kijamii kama kero.	another thought that the government considers social networks a nuisance.
276	He warned citizens to take precautions when speaking out on public platforms because the government can legally access all their details through the platform host.	Aliwatahadharisha wananchi kuchukua tahadhari wanapozungumza kwenye majukwaa ya wazi kwa sababu serikali ina nguvu za kisheria kupata taarifa zao zote kupitia wamiliki wa majukwaa hayo.	he warned the citizens to be cautious when speaking on open platforms because the government has the legal power to obtain all their information through the owners of those platforms.
277	EPOCA 2020 makes it virtually impossible to remain anonymous online, under Regulation 9(e), coupled with the requirement imposed on the internet café providers to register users via recognized IDs, assign static IP addresses to their computers and put camera surveillance to record the activities in their premises, according to this analysis by the Media Council of Tanzania.

278	These regulations reinforce criminal defamation, restrict anonymity, provide hefty punishments for violations and grant sweeping powers of content removal to the TCRA and intermediaries.

Hata hivyo, serikali ya Tanzania inawajibika kuheshimu na kutunza haki za watu kujieleza na kukusanyika   ikiwa ni pamoja na wanahabari, wanachama wa asasi za kiraia, na wanasiasa wa upinzani, kwa mujibu wa katiba ya Tanzania pamoja na mikataba ya kimataifa na ile ya jumuiya za kimaeneo.	however, the government of tanzania is responsible for respecting and preserving the rights of people to express themselves and assemble, including journalists, members of civil society organizations, and opposition politicians, according to the constitution of tanzania and international and regional community agreements.

311	The Bad and the Good of Magufuli are equally undeniable, and it means the legacy he leaves behind is complicated but also valuable.	Mabaya na mazuri ya Magufuli hayawezi kupingika kwa uzito unaofanana, na hiyo ina maana kuwa kumbukumbu anayoiacha nyuma ina utata wake lakini yenye maana kubwa.	the bad and the good of magufuli cannot be weighed with the same weight, and that means the legacy he leaves behind is controversial but of great significance.
312	The pro-Magufuli and anti-Magufuli camps will never agree and the debate will go on for years.

Mwezi Aprili mwaka jana, mathalani, Magufuli alikataa mkopo wa dola bilioni 10 (dola za Marekani) kutoka China kwa ajili ya mradi wa bandari kubwa unaopendezwa kutekelezwa Bagamoyo karibu na jiji la Dar es Salaam, akisema, ni mlevi pekee anayeweza kukubaliana na masharti haya.	for instance, in april last year, magufuli refused a 10 billion dollar (us dollars) loan from china for a major port project to be implemented in bagamoyo near the city of dar es salaam, saying, only a drunkard could agree to these terms.

320	His anti-corruption focus also appealed to Western audiences, and the media initially covered his ideas positively.

323	Been watching Tanzania mourning John Magufuli.	Nimekuwa nikifuatilia Tanzania inavyomwombolezea John Magufuli.	i have been following how tanzania is mourning john magufuli.
324	We denounced his autocratic ways, populism & sneered at his unscientific bent, but clearly, with the man and woman on the street, the fellow was quite popular.	Tulipinga njia zake za kidikteta na kumkosoa kwa tabia yake ya kupuuza sayansi, lakini ni wazi, kwa kutazama watu wanaosimama barabarani [kumuaga], huyu jamaa alikuwa maarufu.	we opposed his dictatorial ways and criticized him for his habit of ignoring science, but clearly, looking at the people standing on the roadside [to bid him farewell], this guy was popular.
325	However, Magufuli applied an authoritarian-style rule during which human rights and free speech increasingly suffered.	Hata hivyo, utawala wa Magufuli alikuwa wa kimabavu na hivyo kuathiri sana haki za binadamu na uhuru wa kujieleza.	however, magufuli's regime was oppressive and thus greatly affected human rights and freedom of expression.
326	Over the last six years, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Committee to Protect Journalists, Global Voices and others have steadily tracked the deterioration of the civil and human rights protections.	Kwa zaidi ya miaka sita, mashirika ya Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Kamati ya Kulinda Waandishi wa Habari (CPJ), Global Voices na mengineyo  yamekuwa yakifuatilia kuzorota kwa ulinzi wa haki za kiraia na haki za binadamu.	for more than six years, organizations such as human rights watch, amnesty international, committee to protect journalists (cpj), global voices and others have been monitoring the deterioration of civil rights and human rights protections.

328	When parliament in January 2019 debated the Political Parties Act, leading to a restriction of opposition parties, it was interpreted as a bad omen when an owl entered parliament.	Wakati Bunge lilipokuwa likijadili Sheria ya Vyama vya Siasa Januari 2019, sheria iliyokosolewa kwa kuvibana zaidi vyama vya siasa, hiyo ilitafsiriwa kama dalili mbaya hasa bundi alipoonekana ndani ya jengo la bunge.	when parliament was discussing the political parties act in january 2019, a law criticized for further restricting political parties, this was interpreted as a bad sign especially when an owl was seen inside the parliament building.
329	Magufulis administration often used legislation like Electronic and Postal Communication (Online Content) (EPOCA), or the Cybercrimes Act to clamp down on opposition voices and public dissent.	Utawala wa Magufuli mara kadhaa ulitumia sheria mbalimbali kama ile Sheria ya Mawasiliano ya Kielektroniki na Posta (Maudhui ya Mtandaoni) (EPOCA), au  Sheria ya Makosa ya Mtandao kubana sauti pinzani na maoni huru.	magufuli's administration often used various laws such as the electronic and postal communications (online content) (epoca) act, or the cybercrimes act to suppress opposition voices and free opinions.
330	Amended regulations in 2020 prohibited citizens from sharing public information that may cause public chaos or disorder and content with information about an outbreak of a deadly or contagious disease without the government approval from top officials.	Mabadiliko ya kanuni mbalimbali ya mwaka 2020 yalilenga kuwazuia wananchi kusambaza habari zinazoweza kusababisha uvunjivu wa amani au uchochezi na maudhui yenye habari zinazohusu magonjwa ya mlipuko au magonjwa hatari bila kuithibitishwa na serikali kupitia kwa maafisa wake wa juu.	the changes to various regulations in 2020 aimed to prevent citizens from spreading information that could cause peace disruption or incitement and content with information about outbreak diseases or dangerous diseases without being confirmed by the government through its senior officials.
331	Citizens couldnt speak about an earthquake that shook the coastal region last year, let alone the pandemic that reached Tanzania months later.	Raia hawakuweza kuzungumza chochote kuhusu tetemeko lililoyakumba maeneo ya pwani mwezi uliopita, mbali na habari za mlipuko nchini humo uliotokea miezi kadhaa baadaye.	the citizens could not say anything about the earthquake that hit the coastal areas last month, apart from the news of the explosion in the country that occurred several months later.
332	And during the two-week period of wild speculation about Magufulis whereabouts and health status in early March, at least four people were reportedly arrested for tweeting about the ill president.	Na wakati wa majuma mawili ya uvumi kuhusu alipo hasa Magufuli pamoja na afya yake mapema mwezi Machi, watu wasiopungua wanne walidaiwa kukamatwa kwa kosa la kutwiti kuhusu ugonjwa wa rais.	during the two weeks of speculation about magufuli's exact whereabouts and his health in early march, no fewer than four people were reportedly arrested for tweeting about the president's illness.
333	Did he die of COVID-19, tho?	Au alifariki kwa Korona?	did he die from corona?
334	Magufuli reportedly died of heart complications  an issue for which he had been receiving treatment for 10 years.	Magufuli anasemekana alifariki kwa maradhi ya moyo ambayo inasemekena amekuwa akipata matibabu yake kwa miaka 10.	magufuli is said to have died from heart disease, which he is said to have been receiving treatment for 10 years.
335	But Magufulis sudden death left many wondering if he had perhaps succumbed to COVID-19.	Lakini kifo cha ghafla cha Magufuli kiliwaacha wengi wakihoji kama huenda aliambukizwa virusi vya Korona (UVIKO-19).	but the sudden death of magufuli left many questioning whether he might have been infected with the corona virus (covid-19).
336	To many  not the least, Western audiences  Magufuli will be remembered for his COVID-19 denial.	Kwa wengi  hasa nchi za ki-Magharibi  Magufuli atakumbukwa kwa kukana uwepo wa ugonjwa wa Korona nchi mwake.	for many, especially in western countries, magufuli will be remembered for denying the existence of the corona disease in his country.
337	Tanzania did initially impose restrictions and guidelines to curb the spread of the virus, but Magufuli repeatedly denounced lockdowns as a greater threat to the economy than the virus.	Wakati ugonjwa huu unaingia Tanzania, serikali ilichukua tahadhari pamoja na kutoa miongozo ya namna ua kupambana na kusambaa kwa ugonjwa huu, lakini baadae, mara kwa mara, Magufuli amekuwa alilichukulia zuio la  watu kuendelea na shughuli zao kama tishio kubwa la uchumi kuliko virusi vya ugonjwa huu.	when this disease entered tanzania, the government took precautions and issued guidelines on how to combat and prevent the spread of this disease, but later, repeatedly, magufuli considered the restriction of people to continue with their activities as a greater economic threat than the virus of this disease.
338	He actively rebuked international guidance on public health protocols like wearing masks, social distancing and vaccines  urging citizens to use prayer and herbal remedies instead.	Mara nyingi alipinga mwongozo wa kimataifa kuhusu kanuni za afya kama kuvaa barakoa, kuepuka misongamano na chanjo  akiwasihi wananchi kutegemea maombi na tiba za asili kama hatua mbadala.	often he opposed international guidance on health rules such as wearing masks, avoiding crowds and vaccinations, urging citizens to rely on prayers and traditional remedies as an alternative.
339	After Magufuli halted the publication of COVID-19 data last year in April, he then insisted COVID-19 had been fended off by prayer.	Baada ya Magufuli kuzuia kutangazwa kwa takwimu za maambukizi ya Korona mwaka jana mwezi Aprili, alisisitiza kwamba Korona imeshindwa kwa nguvu za maombi.	after magufuli blocked the announcement of corona infection statistics last year in april, he insisted that corona was defeated by the power of prayer.
340	Soon after, he declared Tanzania COVID-19 free.	Baadae kidogo, alitangaza kwamba Tanzania  haina ugonjwa wa Korona.	a little later, he announced that tanzania has no corona disease.
341	Though it is impossible to say exactly how COVID-19 has affected Tanzania, it did not go away.	Ingawa haiwezekani kusema ni kwa kiwango gani Korona iliiathiri Tanzania, tunachofahamu ni kwamba Korona haikuondoka.	although it is impossible to say to what extent corona affected tanzania, what we know is that corona did not leave.
342	When a new COVID-19 wave reemerged in January, many Tanzanians shared testimonies on social media of becoming ill with COVID-19-like symptoms.	Mlipuko mpya wa Korona ulipotokea Januari, wa-Tanzania wengi walizungumzia shuhuda zao kwenye mitandao ya kijamii wakisimulia vile walivyougua ugonjwa wenye dalili kama Korona.	when the new corona outbreak occurred in january, many tanzanians shared their experiences on social media, describing how they suffered from a disease with symptoms like corona.
343	Knowing that it could be punishable to discuss COVID-19, people wrote nimonia mpya or the new pneumonia and breathing problems.	Kwa kufahamu kuwa wangeweza kukamatwa kwa kosa la kujadili Korona, mijadala hiyo ilikwenda kwa jina la nimonia mpya na changamoto za upumuaji.	knowing that they could be arrested for discussing corona, the debate went by the name of new pneumonia and respiratory challenges.
344	But Magufuli doubled down with his anti-vaccination stance in a speech from his home in Chato, on January 27:	Lakini Magufuli aliendea na msimamo wake wa kupinga chanjo katika hotuba  aliyoitoa nyumbani kwake Chato, mnamo Januari 27:	but magufuli stuck to his stance against vaccines in a speech he gave at his home in chato, on january 27:
345	If the white man was able to come up with vaccinations, he should now have found a vaccination against AIDS; he would now have found a vaccination against tuberculosis; he would now have found a vaccination against malaria; he would now have found a vaccination against cancer.	Kama mzungu anaweza kuja na chanjo, basi angeshagundua chanjo ya UKIMWI; angeshagundua chanzo cha kifua kikuu; na sasa hivi angeshajua chanjo ya malaria; angeshapata chanjo ya kansa.	if a white man could come up with a vaccine, then he would have already discovered the aids vaccine; he would have discovered the source of tuberculosis; and by now he would know the malaria vaccine; he would have found the cancer vaccine.
346	This was a major departure from Magufuli's predecessor, President Jakaya Kikwete, who served as global ambassador for immunization in early 2016.	Kauli hii inaweza kuchukuliwa kama kumrudisha nyuma mtangulizi wa Magufuli, Rais Jakaya Kikwete, aliyewahi kuhudumu kama balozi wa dunia kwa kinga mwanzoni mwa 2016.	this statement can be taken as a setback to magufuli's predecessor, president jakaya kikwete, who once served as a global ambassador for immunity at the beginning of 2016.
347	Last month, Magufuli finally did admit that his country had a coronavirus problem, urging Tanzanians to wear locally made face masks.	Mwezi uliopita, Magufuli hatimaye alikiri kwamba nchi yake ina tatizo la korona, akiwasihi wa-Tanzania kuvaa barakoa walizotengeneza wenyewe.	last month, magufuli finally admitted that his country has a corona problem, urging tanzanians to wear masks they made themselves.
348	It took the death of Zanzibars Vice President Seif Sharif Hamad, apparently, to break Magufulis intransigence.	Wadadisi wa mambo wanasema hatua hii ya Magufuli kubadili mtazamo kuhusu korona ilichangiwa na kifo cha Makamu wa Zanzibar  Seif Sharif Hamad.	observers say this step by magufuli to change his view on corona was influenced by the death of zanzibar's vice president seif sharif hamad.
349	Several high-ranking officials from the political elite and close to Magufuli have also died of the disease.

375	In an open letter to Magufuli, Eyakuze points out the inconsistency of Magufuli's ideas, but also applies the empathy Magufuli himself seemed to lack, at times  and forgives him.	Katika barua ya wazi kwa Magufuli,  Eyakuze anaeleza kubadilika badilika kwa misimamo ya Magufuli, lakini anatumia mbinu ya kuelewa hisia za mwingine, mbinu ambayo inaonekana kumshinda Magufuli mwenyewe  mara nyingine  na kumsamehe.	in an open letter to magufuli, eyakuze explains the changing positions of magufuli, but he uses the technique of understanding the feelings of another, a technique that seems to defeat magufuli himself at times and forgive him.

405	Magufuli, nicknamed the bulldozer for his tough anti-corruption stance, was reelected for a second time in October 2020 during an election that was highly criticized for stifling dissent and opposition.

406	Just before the elections, Tanzanians experienced an internet shutdown with access denied to all the major social media platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and Twitter.	Kabla ya uchaguzi huo, Watanzania walishangazwa na kuzimwa kwa mitandao ambapo majukwaa yote makubwa ya mitandao ya kijamii ikiwa ni pamoja na Instagram, WhatsApp na Twitter yalifungwa yasipatikane.	before that election, tanzanians were shocked by the shutdown of networks where all major social media platforms including instagram, whatsapp and twitter were blocked and made inaccessible.

Mpaka leo, Watanzania wengi hawawezi kuingia kwenye mtandao wa Twita bila kutumia teknolojia ya kutumia mitandao ya siri yaani VPN.	until today, many tanzanians cannot access the twitter network without using vpn technology.
408	Over the last five years, the Magufuli administration has narrowed democratic and civic spaces and has cracked down hard on freedom of expression and access to information in digital spaces.	Kwa zaidi ya miaka mitano, utawala wa Magufuli umebana mno uhuru wa demokrasia na shughuli za kiraia sambamba na kuminya uhuru wa kujieleza na haki ya kupata taarifa kwenye majukwaa ya kidijitali.	for more than five years, magufuli's administration has severely restricted democratic freedoms and civil activities, along with suppressing freedom of expression and the right to access information on digital platforms.
409	With the governments strong denial stance, Tanzanians are not allowed to release any COVID-19 data that the government has not verified, which means that ordinary citizens as well as journalists and medical professionals are barred from commenting on COVID-19 in digital spaces, or accessing information.	Kufuatia msimamo mkali wa serikali kukana uwepo wa UVIKO-19, Watanzania hawaruhusiwi kutoa takwimu zozote za UVIKO-19 ambazo serikali haijazihakiki, hii ikiwa na maana kwamba wananchi wa kawaida ikiwa ni pamoja na waandishi wa habari na wataalam wa afya wanazuiwa kutoa maoni kuhusu UVIKO-19 kwenye majukwaa ya kidijitali au kupata taarifa muhimu.	following the government's firm stance on denying the existence of covid-19, tanzanians are not allowed to release any covid-19 statistics that the government has not verified, meaning that ordinary citizens, including journalists and health experts, are prevented from expressing opinions about covid-19 on digital platforms or accessing important information.
410	Access to COVID-19 information has become an elite privilege, according to one doctor from the national hospital who spoke to Global Voices on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal.	Haki ya kupata taarifa za UVIKO-19 imegeuka kuwa upendeleo wa tabaka la watu fulani, kwa mujibu wa daktari mmoja wa hospitali ya taifa aliyeongea na Global Voices kwa masharti ya kutokufahamika, akiogopa kufukuzwa kazi.	the right to access covid-19 information has turned into a privilege for a certain class of people, according to one national hospital doctor who spoke to global voices on condition of anonymity, fearing job loss.
411	Unlike other countries with established COVID-19 information response teams who give daily updates on COVID-19, Tanzania simply offers a website with limited and outdated COVID-19 information.	Tofauti na nchi nyingine zenye timu maalum zinazofanyia kazi taarifa za UVIKO-19, Tanzania ina tovuti yenye taarifa chache zilizopitwa na wakati kuhusu UVIKO-19.	unlike other countries with special teams working on covid-19 information, tanzania has a website with few outdated information about covid-19.
412	The denial has been so convincing that its now widely accepted by Tanzanians, including medical experts, who disregard basic safety measures like wearing face masks and social distancing.	Matamshi ya kukataa uwepo wa UVIKO-19 yanaonekana kukubalika na Watanzania wengi, ikiwa ni pamoja na wataalam wa afya, wanaopuuza hatua muhimu za kuchukua tahadharani kama kuvaa barakoa na kuepuka misongamano.	statements denying the existence of covid-19 seem to be accepted by many tanzanians, including health experts, who ignore important precautionary measures such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds.
413	Global Voices visited major hospitals such Muhimbili, the government referral hospital in Dar es Salaam, the cultural capital, as well as Benjamin Mkapa Hospital in Dodoma, the political capital, and witnessed very few measures taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease.

414	People are allowed to enter hospital premises without wearing masks, there are few working hygiene and washing facilities and those that do exist lack water or are broken, which was witnessed, for example, in the pregnant mothers clinic at Muhimbili.	Watu wanaruhusiwa kuingia kwenye maeneo ya hospitali bila kuvaa barakoa, kuna vifaa vichache vya usafi na kunawa mikono na vile vilivyopo havina maji au vimevunjika, hali iliyoshuhudiwa, kwa mfano, kwenye wodi ya wanawake wajawazito Muhimbili.	people are allowed to enter hospital areas without wearing masks, there are few hygiene and hand washing facilities and those that exist have no water or are broken, a situation witnessed, for example, in the maternity ward at muhimbili.
415	While the Magufuli administration has shown little concern about the impact of the virus on everyday citizens, many government ministries and departments acknowledge that COVID-19 still exists.	Wakati utawala wa Magufuli haujaonesha kujali madhara ya virusi hivi kwa maisha ya kila siku ya wananchi, mawaziri wengi wa serikali yake na idara zake wanakubali kwamba UVIKO-19 upo.	while magufuli's administration has not shown concern for the impact of this virus on the daily lives of citizens, many ministers of his government and its departments acknowledge that covid-19 exists.
416	Tanzania's minister of finance urges ministry staff to take all precautions against the coronavirus, while also saying COVID-19 is not an issue in Tanzania.

418	For example, when Magufuli was sworn in for the second time last year, authorities did practice COVID-19 prevention measures, requiring all attendees to have their temperatures taken and wash their hands at hygiene stations with hand sanitizer provided.	Kwa mfano, Magufuli alipoapishwa kwa mara ya pili mwaka jana, mamlaka za serikali zilichukua tahadhari nyingi dhidi ya UVIKO-19, wakiwalazimisha wahudhuriaji wote kupima joto la mwili na kuosha mikono yao kwenye sehemu maalumu zenye maji na vipupushi.	for example, when magufuli was sworn in for the second time last year, government authorities took many precautions against covid-19, forcing all attendees to check their body temperature and wash their hands at special stations with water and sprays.
419	On January 25, Tanzania's Minister of Finance Dr. Philip Mpango urged his staff to take precautions against COVID-19 while at the same denying its existence in Tanzania, during a meeting in Dodoma, the capital.

421	Global Voices spoke with one medical expert who believed Tanzania may be experiencing a second wave of the outbreak but that this information was kept secret from the public.

Alisema kwamba kuwaacha watu gizani kunafanya kazi yao iwe ngumu lakini aliamini kwamba Watanzania watajaribu kujilinda wenyewe kwa kuchukua tahadhari zote kama inavyoshauriwa na Shirika la Afya Duniani (WHO).	he said that leaving people in the dark makes their work difficult, but he believed that tanzanians would try to protect themselves by taking all precautions as advised by the world health organization (who).
425	He told Global Voices:	Aliiambia Global Voices:	he told global voices:
426	Politicians have taken over the whole COVID[-19] issue and they are playing a dangerous game, but when people will start dying they will start sacking medical staff.	Wanasiasa wameteka suala hili zima la UVIKO-19 na wanacheza mchezo hatari, lakini watu watakapoanza kufa wataanza kuwafukuza wafanyakazi wa afya.	politicians have hijacked this whole issue of covid-19 and are playing a dangerous game, but when people start dying they will start chasing away health workers.
427	Another doctor who spoke to Global Voices anonymously said that although there is some hope in getting a vaccine, Tanzanias denial may slow down access to it, as the government has not taken any steps to acquire it on the global market, opting instead to invest in herbal remedies.	Daktari mwingine aliyezungumza na Global Voices kwa sharti la kutokutaja jina lake alisema kwamba ingawa kuna matumaini ya kupata kinga, matamshi ya serikali ya Tanzania kukanusha uwepo wa ugonjwa huo yatakwamisha upatikanaji wake, kwa sababu serikali haijachukua hatua yoyote kuitafuta kwenye masoko ya dunia, na  badala yake kukimbilia tiba za mitishamba.	another doctor who spoke to global voices on condition of anonymity said that although there is hope of getting a vaccine, the tanzanian government's denial of the disease will hinder its availability, because the government has not taken any steps to seek it on the world markets, and instead rushed to herbal remedies.
428	In December 2020, Health Minister spokesman Gerald Chamii cast doubt on global vaccines, telling the East African:	Mwezi Desemba 2020, Msemaji wa Waziri wa Afya Gerald Chamii alionesha mashaka yake kwa chanjo zinazopigiwa chapuo duniani, akiliambia jarida la East African:	in december 2020, the health minister's spokesperson gerald chamii expressed his doubts about the vaccines being promoted globally, telling the east african journal:
429	It takes not less than six months to find a vaccine or cure for a certain disease.	Haichukui hata miezi sita kupata chanjo au tiba ya ugonjwa fulani.	it doesn't even take six months to get a vaccine or treatment for a certain disease.
430	We have fared on our own since the pandemic spread, I am not sure if it is wise to have a vaccine imported and distributed to the citizens without undertaking clinical testing to approve if it is safe for our people.	Tumejikwamisha wenyewe tangu mlipuko uanze, sina hakika kama ni busara kuingiza kinga hiyo na kuisambaza kwa wananchi bila kufanya majaribio ya kitabibu kuthibitisha usalama wake kwa watu wetu.	we have been stuck since the outbreak began, i'm not sure if it's wise to introduce that vaccine and distribute it to the public without conducting medical trials to confirm its safety for our people.
431	Access to information is essential to democracy and development.	Kupata taarifa ni suala muhimu kwa demokrasia na maendeleo.	getting information is important for democracy and development.
432	Tanzanias cyber laws have been abused to target dissenting voices and those who have spoken out against Tanzanias handling of COVID-19.	Sheria za matumizi ya mtandao nchini Tanzania zimetumiwa vibaya zikilenga kunyamazisha sauti na wale wanaozungumza kupinga namna Tanzania inavyoshughulikia suala la UVIKO-19.	the internet usage laws in tanzania have been misused, targeting to silence voices and those speaking out against how tanzania is handling the covid-19 issue.
433	Freedom of expression, including the right to access, receive and impart information, is enshrined in international law.	Uhuru wa kujieleza, ikiwa ni pamoja na haki ya kupata, kupokea, na kusambaza habari, imelindwa na sheria za kimataifa.	freedom of expression, including the right to access, receive, and disseminate information, is protected by international laws.
434	In Tanzania, the right to be informed, and to access and disseminate information, is recognized in Articles 18(1) and 18(2) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.	Nchini Tanzania, haki ya kuhabarishwa, na kupata taarifa na kusambaza taarifa, inatambuliwa na Ibara 18(1) na 18(2) ya Katiba ya Jamhuri ya Muungano wa Tanzania.	in tanzania, the right to be informed, and to receive and disseminate information, is recognized by article 18(1) and 18(2) of the constitution of the united republic of tanzania.
435	Nevertheless, these rights are more cosmetic than based in reality.	Hata hivyo, haki hizi zinaonekana kuwa nadharia zaidi kuliko uhalisia.	however, these rights seem to be more theoretical than practical.
436	With full-throttled COVID-19 denial and laws in place to prevent the open exchange of information and opinions on the disease on- and offline, Tanzanians are left with severely limited access to information and many are afraid to speak out.	Katika hali ambayo serikali inakanusha uwepo wa UVIKO-19 na kuwepo kwa sheria zinazozuia watu kupeana taarifa na kutoa maoni kuhusu ugonjwa huu, mtandaoni na mtaani, Watanzania wanaachwa bila taarifa za msingi na wengi wanaogopa kuzungumza.	in a situation where the government denies the existence of covid-19 and the existence of laws preventing people from sharing information and expressing opinions about this disease, online and on the street, tanzanians are left without basic information and many are afraid to speak.

441	The document states that the pregnancies resulted from the students sexual relations with their instructors, without specifying whether these relations were consensual.

442	Moreover, it states that pregnant students will not be able to complete the course at present, and will have their trips back to their home provinces paid for by the police.	Hata hivyo imeelezwa kwamba wanafunzi wajawazito hawataweza kumaliza mafunzo kwa sasa, na watasafiri kurudi makwao wakilipiwa usafiri na polisi.	however, it has been reported that pregnant students will not be able to complete their studies for now, and they will travel back to their homes with their transportation paid for by the police.

450	This is serious.	Hili jambo kubwa sana.	this matter is very big.
451	It is serious because, as the document itself states, it involves the instructors.	Ni jambo kubwa kwa sababu kama nyaraka zilivyoonesha wahusika ni wakufunzi.	it is a big deal because as the documents showed, the culprits are trainers.
452	Now, one person who holds authority over another gets them pregnant, and the outcome is a little process?	Sasa mtu mmoja mwenye mamlaka juu ya mwingine anamtia mimba na matokeo yake ni mchakato kidogo?	now one person with authority over another impregnates them and the result is a minor process?
453	This reminds me of the teacher who demanded sex from students in exchange for grades or not to be humiliated in class because, in the teacher's view, they were dumb, instead of being prosecuted he was transferred to teach somewhere else.	Hili linanikumbusha kuhusu mwalimu aliyedai rushwa ya ngono kwa wanafunzi wake ili awape maksi au ili asiwadhalilishe darasani kwa sababu kwa mtazamo wake wanafunzi hao ni wajinga, na badala ya kushtakiwa mwalimu yule alihamishwa akafundishe mahali pengine.	this reminds me of a teacher who demanded sexual bribes from his students in order to give them marks or not to humiliate them in class because in his view those students were stupid, and instead of being prosecuted, that teacher was transferred to teach somewhere else.

457	Building a society of social justice, in defence of equal rights for citizens, requires a balanced education and development policy, valuing the development of citizens, with scientific knowledge and moral, civic and patriotic education.	Kuunda jamii yenye usawa kijamii katika kulinda haki sawa kwa wananchi inahitaji elimu sawia pamoja na sera za maendeleo zinazojali maendeleo ya wananchi pamoja na maarifa ya kisayansi na maadili pamoja na elimu ya uzalendo.	creating a socially equal society in protecting equal rights for citizens requires equitable education along with development policies that care about the development of citizens, scientific knowledge and ethics, as well as patriotic education.
458	The Matalane case	Shauri la Matalane	matalane's issue
459	Blaming violence on women is a common practice in chauvinist/patriarchal societies, known for devaluing women and submission to the wishes of men, resulting in judgements about the victim's conduct and minimizing the aggressor's conduct.	Kulaumu ukatili dhidi ya wanawake ni jambo la kawaida kwa jamii zenye mfumo dume, zinazofahamika kwa kudhalilisha wanawake na kuwafanya kutii matakwa ya wanaume ikiletea kuhukumiwa kwa matendo ya wahanga na kupunguza hatia ya wanyanyasaji.	blaming violence against women is common in patriarchal societies, known for degrading women and making them obey the desires of men, leading to the victims being blamed and the guilt of the abusers being reduced.

640	The truth of Hachalu's assassination is not yet fully clear, and in its aftermath, speculation began to fly as politicians and activists stoked long-standing tensions between Oromo and Amahara elites, two of Ethiopia's largest ethnic groups.	Ukweli ni kwamba mauaji ya Hachalu hayajawekwa wazi vizuri na pia matokeo yake, uvumi ulianza kuenea baada ya wanasiasa na wanaharakati  kuweka msisitizo mkubwa kuhusu mgogoro uliopo baina ya viongozi wakuu wa Oromo na Amahara ambayo ni makabila makubwa kabisa nchini Ethiopia.	the truth is that the murder of hachalu was not clearly exposed and as a result, rumors began to spread after politicians and activists placed great emphasis on the conflict between the top leaders of the oromo and amahara, which are the largest tribes in ethiopia.
641	That day, mourners flooded the streets of Addis Ababa and cities and towns across Oromia state.	Siku ya maziko yake, waombolezaji walifurika katika mitaa ya Addis Ababa na miji mingine inayozunguka jimbo la Oromo.	on the day of his funeral, mourners flooded the streets of addis ababa and other towns surrounding the oromo region.
642	The next morning, Oromia Media Network (OMN), a satellite TV station on which Hachalu had his last contentious interview, provided online and TV coverage as his casket was transferred from Addis Ababa to Hachalus hometown, Ambo.	Asubuhi iliyofuata Kituo cha runinga ya setilaiti cha Oromia Media Network (OMN), ambapo ndipo Hachalu alifanya mahojiano yake ya mwisho walirusha matangazo mubashara kupitia runinga na pia mitandao na kuonesha wakati jeneza lake likisafirishwa kutoka Addis Ababa kwenda nyumbani kwao huko mjini Ambo.	the following morning, the oromia media network (omn) satellite tv station, where hachalu had his last interview, broadcast live on television and also online, showing his coffin being transported from addis ababa to his home in the city of ambo.
643	The slow, televised journey turned into a deadly battle between government authorities and opposition politicians over where Hachalu would be buried, and OMN interrupted its coverage as the hearse was forced to return to Addis Ababa.	Matangazo hayo yaliyokwenda polepole sana yaligeuka kuwa uwanja wa mapambano baina ya mamlaka za serikali na viongozi wa upinzani, kukiwa na mabishano ya wapi hasa akazikwe Hachalu  na OMN ilibidi wakatize matangazo yake; inasemekana walilazimishwa kurejea Addis Ababa.	those slow broadcasts turned into a battleground between government authorities and opposition leaders, with disputes over where exactly hachalu should be buried, and omn had to interrupt its broadcasts; it is said they were forced to return to addis ababa.

646	Confusion swirled after government authorities eventually took Halachu's body back to Ambo by helicopter, where feuding parties continued to clash, denying the bereaved family members a proper burial.	Utata uliibuka zaidi baada ya mamlaka za serikali kuuchukua tena mwili wa Hachalu na kuupeleka mjini kwao Ambo kwa njia ya helkopta, ambapo pia pande mbili ziliendelea kugombana na kuinyima familia ya marehemu fursa ya kumpa ndugu yao maziko stahiki.	the confusion escalated further after government authorities retook the body of hachalu and transported it by helicopter to their hometown of ambo, where the two sides continued to quarrel and deny the deceased's family the opportunity to give their relative a proper burial.

650	A number of people were shot and killed by government security forces, but several news outlets including Voice of America and Addis Standard reported that angry mobs from the Oromo ethnic group attacked multiethnic, interfaith towns and cities in southeastern Oromia, targeting non-Oromo, non-Muslim families in the region.	Watu kadhaa walipigwa risasi na mamlaka za usalama lakini baadhi ya vyanzo vya habari ikiwamo Sauti ya Amerika na Addis Standard viliripoti kuwa vikundi vya watu wenye hasira kutoka kabila la Oromo walishambulia watu wa makundi mbalimbali ikiwepo miji na mitaa inayokaliwa na watu wa imani tofauti tofauti, iliyo Kusini Mashariki mwa mji wa Oromo, wakilenga hasa familia za watu wasio Waoromo na wasio Waislam katika ukanda huo.	several people were shot by security authorities, but some news sources including voice of america and addis standard reported that angry groups of people from the oromo tribe attacked various groups of people, including cities and neighborhoods inhabited by people of different faiths, in the southeast of the city of oromo, specifically targeting families of non-oromo and non-muslim people in that region.
651	Most of the violence fell along ethnic Amahara-Oromo lines, but religion may have played a more central role due to an intricate, localized understanding of ethnicity: The southeast Oromo communitys ethnic identity markers usually combine the religion of Islam and the Afan-Oromo language.	Vurugu zaidi zilikuwa katika ukanda wenye mchanganyiko wa watu wa Amahara-Oromo na dini inaweza ikawa imecheza nafasi kubwa kwa sababu ya uelewa uliopo kwamba: jamii ya Waoromo wa Kusini Mashariki inatambulishwa kwa mchangayiko wa dini ya Kiislamu na watumiaji wa lugha ya Afan-Oromo.	more disturbances were in the region with a mix of amahara-oromo people and religion may have played a significant role due to the understanding that: the southeastern oromo community is characterized by a mix of islam and users of the afan-oromo language.
652	A local farmer reportedly said we thought Hachalu was Oromo after he watched Hachalu's televised funeral rites that followed the traditions of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.	Mkulima mmoja wa maeneo hayo alisema kwamba tulifikiri Hachalu ni Muoromo baada ya kuangalia matangazo yaliyorushwa moja kwa moja yakionesha shughuli za maziko ya Hachalu yaliyofuata desturi za Kanisa la Kiothodoksi la Tewahedo Ethiopia.	one farmer from those areas said that we thought hachalu was an oromo after watching live broadcasts showing the funeral proceedings of hachalu that followed the traditions of the tewahedo orthodox church of ethiopia.
653	According to reports, most victims of the most gruesome violence were minority Christian Amharas, Christian Oromos and Gurage people.	Kulingana na ripoti, wahanga wengi wa vurugu hizo walikuwa ni Wakristo wa ki-Amhara, Wakristo wa ki-Oromo na watu wa Gurage.	according to the report, most victims of the violence were amhara christians, oromo christians, and gurage people.
654	Eyewitnesses say mobs destroyed and burned property, committed lynching and beheadings and dismembered victims.

655	A fateful interview	Utabiri wa Mahojiano	interview prediction
656	When news of Hachalus assassination first hit, Oromo diaspora media outlets zeroed in on Hachalus fateful interview with OMN host Guyo Wariyo, that aired the week before Halachu was killed.	Wakati taarifa kuhusu mauaji ya Hachalu ziliposikika tu, chanzo cha habari za Waoromo wa diaspora zilihusisha kifo chake na  mahojiano ya mwisho aliyoyafanya Hachalu na kituo cha runinga cha OMN yakiongozwa na Guyo Wariyo, na yalirushwa wiki moja kabla Hachalu hajauawa.	when news about hachalu's murder was just heard, the source of the oromo diaspora news linked his death to the last interview hachalu had with the omn television station led by guyo wariyo, and it was broadcast a week before hachalu was killed.

658	Hachalu fiercely denied any sympathies with the ruling party, but also decried the deeply discordant and fractionalized Oromo political parties, demonstrating his staunch independence as a thinker and musician  a quality that made him a target for online abuse until the day of his murder.	Hachalu alikataa kuunga chama tawala mkono lakini pia alikosoa  migogoro na utengano katika vyama vya siasa vya Oromo, akionesha uhuru wa mawazo kama mwanamuziki  hali ambayo ilimfanya kuwa mlengwa wa mashambulizi ya watu mtandaoni mpaka siku aliyouawa.	hachalu refused to support the ruling party but also criticized conflicts and divisions within the oromo political parties, demonstrating freedom of thought as a musician, which made him a target of online attacks until the day he was killed.
659	At one point, however, Guyo asked Hachalu about the historical injustices allegedly committed against the Oromo people by Menelik II, Ethiopias 19th-century emperor who shaped modern Ethiopia.	Hata hivyo, Guyo alimuuliza Hachalu kuhusu unyanyasaji wa kihistoria uliofanywa kwa watu wa Oromo na mfalme Menelik II aliyeijenga Ethiopia ya sasa.	however, guyo asked hachalu about the historical oppression of the oromo people by king menelik ii who built the current ethiopia.
660	Hachalu shocked some listeners when he answered that the horse seen immortalized in Meneliks equestrian statue in Addis Ababa belongs to an Oromo farmer called Sida Debelle, and that Menelik robbed that horse.	Hachalu aliwashangaza wasikilizaji wengi aliposema kuwa farasi aliyepandwa na Menelik katika sanamu iliyopo huko Addis Ababa alikuwa mali ya mkulima wa ki-Oromo aliyeitwa Sida Debelle, na Menelik alimuiba farasi huyo.	hachalu surprised many listeners when he said that the horse ridden by menelik in the statue located in addis ababa belonged to an oromo farmer named sida debelle, and menelik stole that horse.
661	This exchange attracted applause  and criticism  from commentators on Facebook and Twitter.	Majibu hayo yalivutia maoni ya kumsifia  na pia ya kumkosoa kutoka kwa watu mbalimbali huko Facebook na Twitter.	those responses attracted praise and also criticism from various people on facebook and twitter.
662	When Hachalu was killed one week later, many members of the Oromo diaspora community immediately speculated that Hachalus criticism of the Menelik II statue infuriated sympathizers of imperial Ethiopia, which may have led to his murder.	Wakati Hachalu alikiuawa wiki moja baadaye watu wengi wa jamii ya Oromo wanaokaa nje ya nchi walihisi kwamba kitendo cha Hachalu kuikosoa sanamu ya Menelik II kiliwakasirisha wanaoiunga mkono Ethiopia ya kifalme na kusababisha kuuawa kwake.	when hachalu was killed a week later, many people from the oromo community living abroad felt that hachalu's criticism of the statue of menelik ii angered those who support the royal ethiopia and caused his death.
663	On social media, Oromo netizens focused obsessively on Hachalus Menelik-related remarks, which led many down a winding path to an insidious disinformation campaign.	Katika mitandao ya kijamii wananchi waling'ang'ana na kile Hachalu alichokisema dhidi ya Menelik, na hili lilisababisha kuenea kwa uvumi wenye taarifa nyingi za uongo.	on social media, citizens grappled with what hachalu said against menelik, and this led to the spread of rumors with many false information.
664	The rest of the interview contains other loaded issues of divisions and contradictions within the Oromo community.	Sehemu nyingine ya mahojiano imebeba taarifa za mambo yanayohusu utengano na migogoro ndani ya jamii ya Waoromo.	another part of the interview carries information about matters concerning separation and conflicts within the oromo community.
665	Throughout the interview, Guyo grilled Hachalu about the countrys ongoing political reforms, stoking anti-government sentiment with questions about Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, himself an Oromo, and whether or not the government had met the demands of the Oromo people after the prime minister came to power in 2018.	Katika mahojiano yote Guyo alimchimba sana Hachalu kuhusu mabadiliko ya kisiasa yanayoendelea nchini na kuhusu vuguvugu la kuipinga serikali kwa kuuliza swali kuhusu Waziri Mkuu Abiy Ahmed, ambaye ni Muoromo na kwamba kama serikali imeweza kutimiza matakwa ya watu wa Oromo tangu aingie madarakani mwaka 2018.	in all the interviews, guyo dug deep into hachalu about the ongoing political changes in the country and about the movement to oppose the government by asking a question about prime minister abiy ahmed, who is oromo, and whether the government has been able to fulfill the demands of the oromo people since he came to power in 2018.
666	Hachalu reiterated his non-involvement in the rabid partisanship of Oromo politics but he did criticize those who question Abiys Oromo identity.	Hachalu alirudia kusema kuwa hajihusishi na siasa za ovyo za Oromo lakini aliwakosoa wote wanaohukumu uzalendo wa Abiy.	hachalu reiterated that he is not involved in the messy politics of oromo but criticized all those who judge abiy's patriotism.
667	He defended his position against top Oromo opposition leaders who sought an alliance with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a once-dominant party with historic ties to the now-defunct Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Front (the EPRDF).	Aliilinda nafasi yake dhidi ya viongozi wakuu wa upinzani walioungana na Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), ambacho kilishawahi kuwa na ukaribu na  chama kikuu chenye historia kubwa cha Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Front (the EPRDF).	he defended his position against the opposition leaders who joined the tigray people's liberation front (tplf), which once had close ties with the major party with a big history, the ethiopian people's revolutionary front (the eprdf).
668	The TPLF turned into an opposition party after Abiy dismantled the EPRDF.	TPLF iligeuka kuwa chama cha upinzani baada ya Abiy kuibomoa EPRDF.	tplf turned into an opposition party after abiy dismantled the eprdf.
669	Hachalu also addressed the political violence in the Oromia region, blaming both government authorities and the militant, splinter right-wing Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) militia group (informally known as OLF-Shane).	Hachalu pia alizungumza kuhusu vurugu za kisiasa zinazoendelea katika mkoa wa Oromo akilaumu pande zote yaani mamlaka za serikali na wanamgambo wa kikundi cha wanamgambo wa mrengo wa kulia Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) ambapo pia (hufahamika kama OLF-Shane).	hachalu also spoke about the ongoing political unrest in the oromo region, blaming both the government authorities and the militants of the right-wing militant group oromo liberation front (olf), also known as olf-shane.
670	Following Hachalus murder, the government was able to acquire and release the full 71-minute interview to the public.	Kufuatia mauaji ya Hachalu, serikali iliweza kuchukua mkanda wa mahojiano yenye urefu wa dakika 71 na  kuyarusha kwa umma.	following the murder of hachalu, the government was able to obtain a 71-minute interview tape and broadcast it to the public.
671	The missing tape included Hachalus accounts of death threats he received from parts of western Oromia, where the radical OLF-Shane militia is active.	Mkanda huo unajumuisha ujumbe wa vitisho vya kuuawa alivyotumiwa Hachalu kutoka pande za Magharibi mwa Oromo, ambapo ndipo vikosi vya wanamgambo wa OLF-Shane wanafanyia shughuli zao.	that tape includes the death threats sent to hachalu from the western parts of oromo, where the olf-shane militia forces conduct their operations.
672	Hachalu said he believed he would not have been attacked on social media if he had praised OLF-Shane.	Hachalu alisema aliamini kuwa asingeshambuliwa mitandaoni kama angewasifia OLF-Shane.	hachalu said he believed he would not have been attacked online if he had praised olf-shane.
673	He addressed a direct conflict he had with Getachew Assefa, Ethiopias security and intelligence chief during the TPLF period.	Alizungumzia moja kwa moja mgogoro baina yake na Getachew Assefa, Afisa Usalama Mkuu wa Ethiopia katika kipindi TPLF ikiwa madarakani.	he directly discussed the conflict between him and getachew assefa, the chief security officer of ethiopia during the time tplf was in power.
674	Guyo, who promoted this interview on Facebook as must-see TV in the days before its broadcast, has since been arrested and the government is investigating the full 71-minutes of interview tape for further clues that may help determine the facts regarding Hachalu's murder.	Guyo, aliyeyatangaza mahojiano hayo katika ukurasa wake wa Facebook kwa kuyaita lazima uyaone siku chache kabla ya kurushwa kwake hewani, amekamatwa na polisi tangu wakati huo na serikali inafanya upelelezi wa mkanda wa dakika 71 za mahojiano hayo ili kupata vielelezo vitakavyosaidia kupata ufumbuzi wa chanzo cha mauaji ya Hachalu.	guyo, who announced the interview on his facebook page by calling it a must-see a few days before it was aired, has been arrested by the police since then and the government is investigating the 71-minute tape of the interview to find evidence that will help solve the cause of hachalu's murder.

677	COVID-19 has deeply affected womens rights in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), from increased domestic violence to job loss.	Janga la COVID-19 limeathiri kwa kiwango kikubwa haki za wanawake huko Mashariki ya Kati na Kaskazini mwa Afrika;  kutoka kuongezeka kwa ukatili majumbani mpaka kupoteza ajira zao.	the covid-19 pandemic has greatly affected women's rights in the middle east and north africa; from an increase in domestic violence to losing their jobs.
678	But there is also one less visible area where women are affected: female genital mutilation (FGM), due to disruption in prevention because of the pandemic.	Lakini kuna eneo moja lililowazi ambapo wanawake wameathirika ambalo mi ukeketaji, na hii ni baada ya kulipuka kwa janga la Korona na heka heka za kukabiliana nalo.	but there is one clear area where women have been affected which is female circumcision, and this is after the outbreak of the corona pandemic and the hustle to deal with it.
679	In April, the United Nations announced that due to pandemic-related disruptions in prevention programs, two million FGM cases could occur over the next decade that would otherwise have been averted.	Mwezi April, Umoja wa Mataifa ulitangaza kuwa kutokama ma vizuizi vilivyotokana na juhudi za kupambana na janga la korona, kuna visa milioni 2 vya ukeketaji ambavyo vinakisiwa kutokea kwa muongo ujao ambapo ingewekana kuzuia kama uzuiaji wa korona usingetibua mpango na juhudi za kupambama na ukeketaji	in april, the united nations announced that due to restrictions resulting from efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic, there are an estimated 2 million cases of female genital mutilation that are expected to occur in the next decade, which could have been prevented if the coronavirus prevention had not disrupted the plan and efforts to combat female genital mutilation.
680	Female genital mutilation includes all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).	Ukeketaji unajumuisha shughuli za kukata kwa sehemu au kuondoa kabisa sehemu ya nje ya uke, au kuumiza sehemu  za uke bila uhusiano au dhana yoyote ya kutabibu, kulingana na Shirika la Afya Ulimwenguni (WHO).	female genital mutilation involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or injury to the female genital organs for no medical reason, according to the world health organization (who).
681	The practice, rooted in extensive traditions, cultural and religious beliefs throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia, is typically performed by traditional midwives or healers using knives, razors or glass.	Kitendo hiki ni utamaduni wa kimila na kidini ulioota mizizi kote barani Afrika, Mashariki ya Kati na Asia , na hufanywa na wakunga wa jadi, waganga kwa kutumia visu, nyembe au vipande vya chupa.	this act is a traditional and religious culture that has taken root all over africa, the middle east and asia, and is performed by traditional midwives, healers using knives, razors or pieces of bottles.
682	FGM, also known as genital cutting, is widely considered as one of the most extreme manifestations of violence against girls and women, and yet it is widely underreported in the Middle East.	Ukeketaji pia unafahamika kama ukataji wa sehemu za siri inaaminika kwa upana kuwa ni  moja ya ukatili uliopitiliza dhidi ya wasichana na wanawake, na bado unaripotiwa kwa uchache sana hasa huko Mashariki ya Kati.	female genital mutilation, also known as cutting of private parts, is widely believed to be one of the most extreme forms of violence against girls and women, and it is still underreported, especially in the middle east.
683	It is estimated that it affects at least 200 million women worldwide.	Inakadiriwa kuwa angalau wanawake milioni 200 wameathiriwa nao.	it is estimated that at least 200 million women have been affected by it.
684	The issue is explained in this UNICEF video:	Jambo hili limeelezewa vyema na UNICEF katika video:	this issue has been well explained by unicef in the video:
685	In the MENA region, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is a problem that primarily concerns Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Iraq and Djibouti.	Katika ukanda wa Mashariki ya Kati na Kaskazini mwa Afrika, ukeketaji ni tatizo ambalo kimsingi linazitatiza nchi za Misri,  Sudan, Yemen, Iraq na Djibouti.	in the middle east and north africa region, female genital mutilation is a problem that primarily affects the countries of egypt, sudan, yemen, iraq, and djibouti.
686	Carlos Javier Aguilar, Regional Adviser Child Protection, explains more.	Carlos Javier Aguilar, Mshauri wa Masuala ya Ulinzi wa Mtoto anaelezea zaidi,	carlos javier aguilar, the child protection advisor explains further,
687	Somalia has the highest prevalence of FGM with an estimated 98 percent of females between 15 and 49 years who experienced genital cutting.	Somalia inadhaniwa kuwa na idadi kubwa ya wahanga wa ukeketaji ambapo asilimia 98 ya wanawake wenye miaka kati ya 15 mpaka 49 wamekeketwa.	somalia is believed to have a large number of female genital mutilation victims, where 98 percent of women aged between 15 and 49 have been mutilated.
688	In Djibouti, an estimated 93 percent are affected, Egypt, 91 percent, Sudan, 88 percent, Mauritania, 69 percent, Yemen,19 percent and Iraq, 7 percent, according to the latest figures released in June by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).	Huko Djibouti, inakadiriwa asilimia 93 wameathirika, Misri asilimia 92, Sudan asilimia 88, Mauritania asilimia 69, Yemen asilimia 19  na Iraki asilimia 7 kulingana na takwimu zilizoachiliwa Juni na Shirika la Umoja wa Mataifa linaloshughulika na Idadi ya watu  (UNFPA).	in djibouti, it is estimated that 93% are affected, egypt 92%, sudan 88%, mauritania 69%, yemen 19% and iraq 7% according to statistics released in june by the united nations population fund (unfpa).
689	The practice varies according to social class, ethnicity and education in each country, with notable differences between urban and rural areas.	Kitendo hiki hutofautiana kulingana na tabaka la kijamii, kabila na hata kiwango cha elimu katika kila nchi na katika maeneo ya mijini au vijijini.	this action varies depending on the social class, tribe, and even the level of education in each country and in urban or rural areas.
690	FGM more often occurs among the poorest, least educated families in rural areas.	Ukeketaji mara nyingi hutokea baina ya watu maskini zaidi au katika familia ambazo hazijaelimika katika maeneo ya vijijini.	female genital mutilation often occurs among the poorest people or in uneducated families in rural areas.
691	In Yemen, FGM is concentrated in coastal regions but less common in the north.	Huko Yemen, ukeketaji umeota mizizi katika ukanda wa Pwani lakini unafanyika kidogo katika maeneo ya Kaskazini.	in yemen, female genital mutilation is deeply rooted in the coastal region but is less prevalent in the northern areas.
692	In Iraq, the practice is more prevalent in northern Kurdish provinces.	Nchini  Iraq, kitendo hiki kimesambaa sana katika upande wa Kaskazini mwa jimbo la Kurdi.	in iraq, this act is very widespread in the northern part of the kurdish province.
693	In Egypt, it is markedly higher among girls living in upper Egypt.	Huko Misri unafanyika zaidi kwa wasichana wanaoishi ukanda wa Juu wa Misri.	in egypt, it is mostly done by girls living in the upper egypt region.
694	In Mauritania, more than 90 percent of women from the poorest families have endured FGM compared to 37 percent of women from the richest families.

695	FGM: An underreported violation	UKEKETAJI: Ukatili Unaoripotiwa Kidogo Zaidi	female genital mutilation: the violence that is slightly more reported
696	The scale and scope of FGM may be underestimated because the official global picture of FGM/C is incomplete, according to a joint report from March, authored by Equality Now, End FGM European Network and the US End FGM/C Network.	Ukubwa na upana wa ukeketaji utakuwa umedharauliwa kwa sababu ya ulimwengu kutokuwa na picha halisi ya ukeketaji iliyokamilika, kulingana na ripoti ya pamoja kuanzia Machi, imeidhinishwa na  Usawa sasa, Mtandao kutoka Ulaya wa Kutokomeza Ukeketaji   na  Mtandao wa kutokomeza ukeketaji kutoka Marekani.	the magnitude and extent of female genital mutilation will have been underestimated due to the world not having a complete picture of female genital mutilation, according to a joint report from march, endorsed by equality now, the european network for the abolition of female genital mutilation, and the american network for the abolition of female genital mutilation.
697	The report revealed growing evidence that the ritual is also practiced in other regions including the Middle East and Asia, and the world woefully underestimates FGM.	Taarifa hiyo ilidhihirisha kuwa utamaduni huu unaongezeka na pia unafanyika hata Mashariki ya Kati na Asia, na  dunia kwa hakika imeupuuzia ukeketaji.	the report revealed that this culture is growing and also taking place even in the middle east and asia, and the world has indeed ignored female genital mutilation.
698	Small sample researches have recently shown that FGM is also practiced in Iran, along with Gulf states such as Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.	Tafiti ndogo zilizo fanyika hivi karibuni zinaonesha kuwa ukeketaji pia unafanyika huko Iran, pamoja na nchi zote za  Ghuba  kama vile  Kuwait, Falme za Kiarabu, Omani na Saudi Arabia.	recent small studies show that female circumcision also takes place in iran, as well as in all gulf countries such as kuwait, united arab emirates, oman and saudi arabia.
699	Divya Srinivasan from Equality Now told Reuters that she was particularly surprised at the results of small studies from places like Saudi Arabia and Oman, which are not normally countries that come to mind when you think of FGM.	Divya Srinivasan kutoka Usawa Sasa aliiambia Reuters kwamba alishangazwa sana na matokeo ya utafiti huo mdogo kutoka maeneo kama vile Omani na Saudi Arabia ambapo kwa kawaida sio maeneo ambayo yanaweza kukujia akilini unapoliwazia suala la Ukeketaji	divya srinivasan from equality now told reuters that she was very surprised by the results of the small study from areas like oman and saudi arabia where normally are not places that would come to mind when you think about the issue of female genital mutilation.
700	The report, published during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Middle East, was not picked up by the Arabic speaking media or translated into Arabic, with little coverage of FGM in Arabic at all.	Taarifa hii ilichapishwa wakati janga la COVID-19 likiwa limeshika kasi huko Mashariki ya Kati na haikuchapishwa wala kutafsiriwa hata kidogo na vyombo vya habari na mitandao ya kijamii ya Kiarabu.	this report was published when the covid-19 pandemic was escalating in the middle east and was not published or translated at all by arabic media and social networks.
701	This lack of public awareness may perpetuate the perception that FGM is not an issue of concern.	Jamii kukosa uelewa kuhusu ukeketaji inaweza kuthibitisha dhana ya kuwa ukeketaji sio jambo la kutilia maanani kabisa.	the community's lack of understanding about female genital mutilation can confirm the notion that female genital mutilation is not something to be taken seriously at all.
702	Social taboos	Miiko ya Kijamii	social customs
703	In the Middle East, taboos around womens bodies and sexuality prevent open, public discussions about sensitive issues like FGM, often tied to cultural, religious and traditional beliefs.	Huko Mashariki ya Kati, kuna miiko inayoizingira miili ya wanawake ambapo ni marufuku kujadili hadharani mambo ya siri kama vile ukeketaji ambapo umefungamanishwa na imani za kimila, dini na utamaduni.	in the middle east, there are taboos surrounding women's bodies where it is forbidden to publicly discuss private matters such as female genital mutilation, which is associated with traditional, religious and cultural beliefs.
704	In Egypt, for example, Christians and Muslims both believe that circumcision of girls prevents them from vice and makes them more attractive for future husbands; mothers fear that their daughters cant get married if they have not been cut, according to a report by Stop FGM Middle East, a campaign created in 2013 to raise awareness about FGM and whose aim is to get the message out that FGM exists not only in Africa, but also in many countries in the Middle East and Asia.	Kwa mfano, nchini Misri Wakristo na Waislamu kwa pamoja wanaamini kwamba ukeketaji wa wasichana unawafanya wavutie zaidi waume zao watarajiwa na unawakinga na mabaya, pia wamama huhofia kwamba mabinti zao hawataolewa kama hawatakeketwa, kulingana na ripoti ya Tokomeza Ukeketaji Mashariki ya Kati, kampeni ambayo iliandaliwa mwaka 2013 kuipa jamii uelewa Kuhusu ukeketaji na pia kuuambia ulimwengu kuwa ukeketaji haupo Afrika pekee bali pia katika nchi nyingi za Mashariki ya Kati na Asia.	for example, in egypt, christians and muslims together believe that female circumcision makes girls more attractive to their prospective husbands and protects them from harm. mothers also fear that their daughters will not get married if they are not circumcised, according to a report by the end fgm middle east campaign, which was organized in 2013 to raise community awareness about female genital mutilation and also to tell the world that female genital mutilation is not only in africa but also in many middle eastern and asian countries.
705	The organization lobbies for more data on FGM and has created a survey toolkit to help individuals and groups create small-scale surveys on FGM.	Taasisi hii inaendelea kukusanya taarifa zaidi za ukeketaji na imetengeneza njia ya kukusanya taarifa itakayosaidia mtu mmoja mmoja au vikundi vya watu kufanya tafiti ndogo juu ya ukeketaji.	this institution continues to gather more information about female genital mutilation and has developed a way to collect information that will help individuals or groups of people conduct small-scale research on female genital mutilation.
706	Unless there is a critical incident that makes headlines, such as the recent FGM-related death of a 12-year-old girl in southern Egypt in February, people tend to avoid the topic.	Watu hupendelea kuepuka mazungumzo na  mada za ukeketaji labda tu litokee tukio litakalogusa vichwa vya habari kama tukio la kifo cha binti wa miaka 12 alifariki baada ya kukeketwa huko Kusini mwa Misri mwezi Februari, ndipo watu huzungumza.	people tend to avoid conversations and topics about female genital mutilation unless an event that touches the headlines occurs, like the incident of the death of a 12-year-old girl who died after being circumcised in southern egypt in february, then people talk.
707	Ghida Hussein, an Egyptian student researching FGM, told Global Voices:	Ghida Hussein, mwanafunzi wa Kimisri aliiambia Global Voices kwamba:	ghida hussein, an egyptian student, told global voices that:
708	As we dont talk about it, it is as if the problem doesnt exist.	Kwa kuwa hatuzungumzi kuhusu jambo hili, ni kama vile tatizo hili halipo kabisa.	since we are not talking about this issue, it's as if this problem doesn't exist at all.
709	FGM is often practiced silently behind closed doors.	Ukeketaji unafanyika kimya kimya nyuma ya milango iliyofungwa.	female genital mutilation is being done quietly behind closed doors.
710	It is happening far from the more educated urban centers of power where activists and politicians are seated.	Inatokea huko mbali na watu walioelimika mijini ambapo ndipo wanaharakati na wanasiasa wanakaa.	it happens far away from the educated people in the cities where activists and politicians reside.
711	FGM is a controversial sensitive issue and unless there is international attention and funding, it is not seen locally as a priority by an overwhelming male political class.	Ukeketaji ni jambo tata na labda  jumuiya ya kimataifa zitoe msaada wa fedha na uhamasishaji, lah sivyo hutaona jamii inayotawaliwa na tabaka la wanaume  wakilipa jambo hili kipaumbele.	female genital mutilation is a complex issue and perhaps international communities should provide financial aid and advocacy, otherwise you will not see a society dominated by a male class prioritizing this issue.
712	Breaking the taboo and speaking out about FGM can expose human rights defenders and victims to hate speech and backlash.	Kuvunja miiko na kuongea kuhusu ukeketaji huwafanya watetea haki za Binadamu kushambuliwa kwa lugha za matusi na chuki.	breaking taboos and talking about female genital mutilation makes human rights defenders subject to verbal abuse and hate speech.
713	In Oman, Women's rights activist Habiba al Hinai, founder of the Omani Association for Human Rights (OAHR), conducted a survey in Oman in 2017 and found that 78 percent of women have been cut.	Nchini Oman, mwanaharakati wa haki za wanawake Habiba al Hinai, mwanzilishi wa Taasisi ya Haki za Binadamu  Omani  alifanya utafiti mdogo mwaka  2017 huko Omani na akagundua kuwa asilimia 78 ya wanawake wamekeketwa.	in oman, women's rights activist habiba al hinai, founder of the omani human rights institute, conducted a small study in 2017 and found that 78 percent of women have been circumcised.
714	After publishing her findings online, Habiba received attacks and threats:	Baada ya kuchapisha matokeo ya utafiti wake mtandaoni, Habiba alipokea mashambulizi na vitisho:	after publishing the results of her research online, habiba received attacks and threats.
715	I posted my results online and the response was huge.	Niliweka matokeo ya utafiti wanhu mtandaoni na mwitikio ulikuwa mkubwa.	i posted the research results online and the response was huge.
716	I was attacked by religious conservatives who say female circumcision is a form of Islamic worship.	Nimeshambuliwa na waafidhina wa kidini ambao walisema kuwa ukeketaji ni sehemu ya ibada ya Waislam.	i have been attacked by religious conservatives who said that female circumcision is part of the islamic worship.
717	In Oman, where FGM is not officially recognized, there is no protection or support for victims.	Huko Omani, ambapo ukeketaji hautambuliki rasmi, hakuna ulinzi kwa wahanga.	in oman, where female genital mutilation is not officially recognized, there is no protection for victims.
718	Habiba added in the report:	Habiba aliongeza haya katika taarifa yake:	habiba added this to her statement:
719	How can you ask a survivor to speak out against FGM and then face all the consequences criticism and online defamation, her family and her tribe may disown her, maybe her husband will divorce her  without proper support.	Ni jinsi gani unaweza kumwambia manusura aongee kuhusu ukeketaji na kisha akumbane na madhara yote haya ikiwamo kukosolewa, kutukanwana hata familia au ukoo wame unaweza kumtenga kabisa, pengine hata mumewe anaweza kumtaliki- kama hakuna namna rasmi ya kuunga mkono.	how can you tell a survivor to speak about female genital mutilation and then she faces all these consequences including being criticized, cursed and even her family or clan can completely ostracize her, perhaps even her husband can divorce her - if there is no formal way to support her.
720	I dont expect these women to speak out and face society.	Sitarajii wanawake hawa kusimama na kuzungumza lwa ujasiri na kuikabili jamii.	i do not expect these women to stand up and speak with courage and confront society.
721	FGM eradication: Too slow, too inadequate	Kutokomeza Ukeketaji: Iko Taratibu sana, Haijitoshelezi	eradicating female genital mutilation: it's a very slow process, it's not enough
722	In Yemen and the United Arab Emirates, FGM is only banned in medical facilities, but not in homes.	Nchini Yemen na  Umoja wa Nchi za Kiarabu, ukeketaji umezuiwa kufanyika katika Taasisi za afya pekee, lakini sio majumbani.	in yemen and the united arab emirates, female circumcision has been prohibited in health institutions only, but not at home.
723	In Mauritania, there are legal restrictions, but not an outright ban.	Nchini Mauritania, kuna kizuizi cha kisheria lakini sio kukatazwa moja kwa moja.	in mauritania, there is a legal restriction but not a direct prohibition.
724	In Iraq, FGM is outlawed in the Kurdish Autonomous Region but is still legal in central Iraq.	Nchini Iraq, ukeketaji umekatazwa huko kwenye jimbo la kidini la Kurdi, lakini bado ni halali katika ukanda wa kati wa Iraq.	in iraq, female genital mutilation is banned in the kurdish religious state, but it is still legal in the central region of iraq.
725	There have, however, been some major breakthroughs to eradicate FGM.	Kumekuwepo na dalili za kutokomeza ukeketaji.	there have been signs of eradicating female genital mutilation.
726	Following years of advocacy from womens rights organizations, Egypt banned the practice in 2008.	Miaka iliyofuata baada ya  kuanzishwa kwa taasisi ya haki za wanawakee, Misri  imekataza ukeketaji mwaka 2008.	the years following the establishment of the women's rights institution, egypt banned female circumcision in 2008.
727	Sudan, in a political transition after 30 years of dictatorship, is the latest to outlaw FGM in April.	Sudani ikiwa katika kipindi cha mpito kisiasa  baada ya miaka 30 ya udikteta, imekuwa ya kwanza kukataza ukeketaji hapo  April.	sudan, being in a period of political transition after 30 years of dictatorship, became the first to ban female circumcision in april.
728	But law enforcement remains a major challenge because FGM still has a high degree of acceptance and prevalence.	Lakini utekelezaji wa sheria ni changamoto kubwa kwa sababu ukeketaji bado uko kwa kiwango cha juu na unakubalika pia umesambaa kwa sehemu kubwa .	but the enforcement of the law is a major challenge because female genital mutilation is still prevalent and is also widely accepted in many areas.
729	Although laws are an important deterrent, they are not enough.	Ingawa sheria sio silaha muhimu sana lakini bado hazijitoshelezi.	although laws are not very important weapons, they are still not sufficient.
730	States need national, comprehensible strategies that include input from police, judiciary, clerics, health care providers and education to civil society.	Nchi zinahitaji mpango na mkakati wa kitaifa unaotekelezeka ukihusisha polisi, mahakama, watoa huduma za afya, makarani na kutoa elimu kwa jumuiya ya kijamii.	countries need a feasible national plan and strategy involving the police, courts, health service providers, clerks, and providing education to the community.
731	A series of regional crises and authoritarian rule has delayed reforms, limiting campaigns and resources to tackle womens rights violations.	Mfululizo wa majanga ya kikanda na mamlaka za kidikteta imechelewesha mabadiliko yakizuia kampeni na rasilimali za kupambama na uvunjifu wa hali za wanawake.	the series of regional disasters and dictatorial authorities have delayed changes, hindering campaigns and resources to combat violations of women's conditions.
732	Now, with the world's attention shifted to COVID-19 and its economic impact, many programs that advocate for womens rights and provide social services to vulnerable women are postponed or no longer a priority.	Sasa macho yote ya ulimwengu yameelekezwa kwenye kupambana na COVID-19 na madhara yake katika uchumi na programu nyingi ambazo zinahusika moja kwa moja na haki za wanawake walio katika mazingira hatarishi na kutoa huduma za kijamii zimeahirishwa kwa au pengine sio kipaumbele tena.	now all eyes of the world are focused on combating covid-19 and its effects on the economy and many programs that are directly involved with the rights of women in vulnerable situations and the provision of social services have been postponed or perhaps are no longer a priority.
733	With more families falling below the poverty line and girls taken out of school or forced into early marriage, FGM is also likely to continue to take place without notice in the region.	Kukiwa na familia nyingi maskini na wasichana wengi wanaoachishwa shule au ndoa utotoni, ukeketaji ni kama vile unaendelea kupata nafasi bila kujulikana katika ukanda huu.	with many poor families and many girls being taken out of school or married off at a young age, female genital mutilation seems to continue to find a place unnoticed in this region.

746	Kadija, Dadiyatas wife recalls in an interview with BBC that her husband was making a phone call, his car was still running, when he was seized by his abductors.	Mke wa Dadiyata, Kadija katika mahojiano na shirikika la habari la BBC alikumbuka kwamba mumewe alikuwa anaongea na simu huku injini ya gari yake ikiwa inaunguruma bado, alipokamatwa na watekaji hao.	dadiyata's wife, kadija, in an interview with the bbc, recalled that her husband was talking on the phone while his car engine was still roaring when he was captured by the kidnappers.
747	Although Kadija could not hear what ensued over the phone or who he was talking to, she recalled that her husband's abductors had followed him, they even came into the house.	Ingawa Kadija hakuweza kusikia kilichokuwa kinazungumzwa au ni nani alikuwa anaongea naye kwenye simu, anakumbuka watekaji wa mume wake walikuwa wanamfuatilia na walikuja hadi nyumbani.	although kadija could not hear what was being said or who was speaking to her on the phone, she remembers that her husband's kidnappers were following her and they came to her house.
748	Dadiyatas wife watched from her room as they drove her husband away.	Mke wa Dadiyata alibaki kuchungulia dirishani chumbani kwao wakati mumewe akichukuliwa na kuondoka watekaji hao.	dadiyata's wife remained peeping through the window in their room while her husband was taken away by those kidnappers.
749	Sadly, theres still no information about Dadiyatas whereabouts.	Mbaya zaidi, ni kwamba hamna taarifa kuhusu alipo Dadiyata.	worse still, there is no information about where dadiyata is.
750	It is painful, Kadija told the BBC, as their children keep asking about their missing father.	Inaumiza, sana jinsi watoto wao wanavyoendelea kumuulizia baba yao aliyepotea, Kadija aliiambia BBC.	it hurts so much how their children keep asking about their missing father, kadija told the bbc.
751	Rather than finding Dadiyata, Nigerian security agencies are absolving themselves from any form of guilt or blame for his disappearance.	Kuliko kumtafuta Dadiyata, taasisi za ulinzi za Nigeria zimeendelea kujitoa kwenye lawama za aina yoyote zinazohusiana na kupotea kwake.	instead of searching for dadiyata, the nigerian defense institutions have continued to absolve themselves of any blame associated with his disappearance.
752	Nigerias Department of State Security (DSS) had in January denied having Dadiyata in their custody.	Idara ya Ulinzi wa Taifa la Naijeria, mpaka Januari iliendelea kukataa kumweka Dadiyata kizuizini.	the nigerian national defense department, until january, continued to refuse to detain dadiyata.
753	The state security agency stated that since Dadiyata was taken away from his house by some armed men does not suggest that those men were DSS staff.	Idara ya Ulinzi wa Taifa inasema kwamba kwa kuwa Dadiyata alichukuliwa nyumbani kwake na watu wenye silaha haimaanishi kwamba watu hao ni wafanyakazi wa Idara ya Usalama wa Taifa.	the national defense department says that just because dadiyata was taken from his home by armed people does not mean that those people are employees of the national security department.
754	Similarly, Aisha Dikko, the attorney general of Kaduna State, denied knowing the whereabouts or of being involved whatsoever in Dadiyatas abduction.	Vilevile mwanasheria mkuu wa Jimbo la Kaduna, Aisha Dikko, alikataa kufahamu alipo au kuhusika na lolote katika utekaji wa Dadiyata.	also, the attorney general of kaduna state, aisha dikko, denied knowing his whereabouts or involvement in the abduction of dadiyata.
755	Anything to the contrary is a vile assertion that seeks to stretch the fact that he was abducted within Kaduna State to mean the involvement of the state government, said Dikko.	Kwa vyovyote ni kinyume na ni mtazamo finyu kutaka kuamini kwamba kwa kuwa alitekwa akiwa katika jimbo la Kaduna basi serikali ya jimbo inahusika, alisema Dikko.	in any case, it is narrow-minded to believe that because he was kidnapped in the state of kaduna, the state government is involved, dikko said.
756	However, these denials by DSS and Kaduna State Government neither mitigates the agony of Dadiyatas wife and their two children  nor does it restore his liberty.	Hata hivyo, kukana kuhusika kwa Usalama wa Taifa na serikali ya jimbo la Kaduna hakuondoi sononeko la mke wa  Dadiyata na watoto wao wawili wala hairejeshi uhuru wake.	however, denying the involvement of the national security and the government of kaduna state does not remove the grief of dadiyata's wife and their two children, nor does it restore his freedom.
757	The plea for Dadiyatas release still echoes on Twitter in this hashtag #OneYearWithOutDadiyata, as Nigerians demand his release.	Maombi ya kutaka kuachiliwa kwa Dadiyata bado yanaendelea kurushwa katika kurasa za Twitter yakiwa na hashtagi ya #MwakaMmojaBilaDadiyata, ikiwa ni dai la Uhuru wake kutoka kwa Wanaijeria.	requests for the release of dadiyata are still being posted on twitter pages with the hashtag #oneyearwithoutdadiyata, which is a demand for his freedom from nigerians.

759	Its unfathomable how a Nigerian would disappear just like that.	Inashangaza jinsi Mnaijeria anaweza kupotea namna hiyo.	it's surprising how a nigerian can get lost like that.
760	We must continue to do everything we can to get Dadiyata reunited with his family.	Lazima tuendelee kufanya kila liwezekanalo kumuunganisha Dadiyata na familia yake.	we must continue to do everything possible to reunite dadiyata with his family.
761	There must be no place for this kind of impunity.	Hakuna nafasi ya uharamia wa namna hii.	there is no room for this kind of piracy.
762	Those that abducted Dadiyata will pay the price.	Hao waliomteka Dadiyata watakuja kuilipa gharama.	those who kidnapped dadiyata will come to pay the cost.

766	All she is demanding is for his holders to forgive him and let him come back to his family; especially his little children.	Kitu pekee anachoomba ni watekaji wamsamehe na kumruhusu mumewe arudi kuungana na familia yake, hasa watoto wake wadogo.	the only thing she asks for is for the kidnappers to forgive her and allow her husband to return and reunite with his family, especially his young children.
767	Akin Akíntáyọ cannot understand how Dadiyata can disappear without a trace for a year:	Akin Akíntáyọ haelewi jinsi  Dadiyata anaweza  kupotea bila kujulikana alipo kwa mwaka mzima:	akin akíntáyọ does not understand how dadiyata can disappear without anyone knowing his whereabouts for a whole year.
768	One question, how can Dadiyata and his car disappear without trace for a year in Nigeria and the government be just so nonchalant about it, seeking exculpation rather than taking full responsibility for finding him, especially when they were a target of his criticism?	Swali moja ninalojiuliza ni jinsi gani Dadiyata na gari lake walivyopotea bila kuacha alama kwa mwaka mzima tena ndani ya Naijeria; na wala serikali haina wasiwasi juu ya jambo hilo, zaidi inatafuta kujiosha badala ya kuchukua wajibu wa kumtafuta kwa kuwa alikuwa mlengwa kwao kwa sababu ya ukosoaji wake?	one question i ask myself is how dadiyata and his car disappeared without a trace for a whole year in nigeria; and the government is not even concerned about it, instead it is looking to absolve itself rather than take responsibility for finding him since he was a target for them because of his criticism?
769	Unfortunately, it seems as if nobody cares about finding the critic.	Bahati mbaya ni kama vile hakuna mtu anayejali kumtafuta mkosoaji huyo:	unfortunately, it's as if no one cares to look for that critic.
770	Rather both the state and federal agencies are busy avoiding blame and doing nothing states human rights activist Professor Chidi Odinkalu in an interview with Vyral Africa:	Kinyume chake taasisi za serikali zote za jimbo na serikali kuu zinapambana kuepuka  lawama kutokufanya chochote alisema mwanaharakati wa Haki za Binadamu Professor Chidi Odinkalu katika mahojiano yake  na Vyral Africa:	on the contrary, all state and federal government institutions are struggling to avoid blame for doing nothing, said human rights activist professor chidi odinkalu in his interview with vyral africa.
771	Besides saying that they dont know where he is.Nobody has really made the effort to tell us what they have done to find him and how it is that they cant account for him.	Zaidi ya kusema kuwa hawajui alipo,hakuna mtu ameonesha  jitihada za kutuambia wamefanya nini hasa ili kumpata  na ni jinsi gani hawatakiwi kuhusishwa naye.	more than saying they don't know where he is, no one has shown efforts to tell us what exactly they have done to find him and how they should not be associated with him.
772	It tells you how so little we matter as citizens.	Hii inakuonesha ni jinsi gani hatuna maana kama raia wadogo.	this shows how insignificant we are as ordinary citizens.
773	The least we can do is ask where Dadiyata is and why cant our government find him.	Kidogo tunachoweza kufanya ni kuuliza yuko wapi Dadiyata na ni kwa nini serikali yetu haimtafuti?	the least we can do is ask where dadiyata is and why our government is not looking for him?

974	A video by Community Correspondent Devidas Gaonkar, a member of the aboriginal shepherd tribe of Goa called Velip, documented the protests of the villagers:	Video ya Mtangazaji wa masuala ya kijamii  Devidas Gaonkar, mzaliwa wa kabila la wafugaji la waGoa inayoitwa Velip, ikionesha maandano ya wanakijiji hao:	a video of social issues broadcaster devidas gaonkar, a native of the goa pastoral tribe called velip, showing the demonstrations of those villagers:

976	Tirwal to Marlem is a three-quilometres road stretch, which is incomplete.	Kuanzia Tirwal mpaka Marlem ni kilomita tatu tu za barabara lakini hazijakamilika.	from tirwal to marlem it's only three kilometers of road, but it's not yet complete.
977	To date, no action has been taken by the authorities.	Mpaka leo hakuna hatua zozote zilizochukuliwa na mamlaka husika.	until today, no steps have been taken by the relevant authorities.
978	They only make false promises, but no implementation.	Wanatupa ahadi za uongo tu hakuna utekelezaji.	they only give us false promises, there is no implementation.
979	For this reason, we havent cast our votes.	Na kwa sababu hiyo basi, hatujapiga kura.	and for that reason, we have not voted.
980	The residents of Marlem have been living in this village for more than 20 years.	Wakazi wa kijiji cha Marlem wamekuwa wakiishi katika kijiji hicho kwa zaidi ya miaka 20 sasa.	the residents of marlem village have been living in that village for over 20 years now.
981	In 1968, the Forest Department declared Marlem village part of a wildlife sanctuary.	Mwaka 1968, idara ya misitu ilitangaza kuwa kijiji cha Marlem kama  sehemu salama kwa wanyama wa mwituni.	in 1968, the forestry department declared the village of marlem a safe place for wild animals.
982	This makes the construction of roads, or any development work in this area, a rather complex issue.	Hili linafanya ujenzi wa barabara au kazi yoyote ya maendeleo katika eneo hili kuwa na ugumu wa kutekeleza.	this makes the construction of roads or any development work in this area difficult to implement.
983	According to reports, an underground power cabling project for carrying electricity to the area had been initially approved, but when digging work commenced, it was soon halted following objections coming from the state Forest Department.	Kulingana na taarifa,  ni kwamba mpango wa kupitisha mkongo wa umeme aridhini ili uweze kufika eneo hilo ulishapitishwa lakini ulizuiwa hivi karibuni kutokana na mapingamizi kutoka kwa Idara ya Misitu ya Taifa	according to the report, the plan to pass the power line underground to reach that area had been approved but was recently halted due to objections from the national forest department.
984	Another source of frustration for the local population is the absence of proper roads.	Chanzo kingine cha mahangaiko ya wakazi wa hapa ni ukosefu wa barabara nzuri.	another source of distress for the residents here is the lack of good roads.
985	One has to navigate a 2.8 km unpaved and broken road to reach the first household at Marlem from the main road.	Mtu anatakiwa kusafiri  kutoka barabara kuu umbali wa kilomita 2.8 katika barabara mbaya na ambayo haijasafishwa vizuri ili aweze kukuta nyumba ya kwanza katika kijiji cha Marlem.	a person is supposed to travel 2.8 kilometers off the main road on a bad and poorly cleaned road to reach the first house in the village of marlem.
986	Finally, the supply of electricity and safe drinking water remain a challenge for the villagers.	Mwisho kabisa, usambazaji wa umeme na maji safi na salama kwa wanakijiji vimebaki kuwa changamoto kwa wanakijiji.	finally, the distribution of electricity and clean and safe water to villagers remains a challenge for the villagers.
987	Having publicly and repeatedly voiced their complaints, but failing to get any answers, the residents of Marlem, as well as residents from two other villages decided not to vote in the elections in order to draw the attention of the authorities towards their issues.	Pamoja na kuweka malalamiko yao hadharani mara kwa mara, lakini wameshindwa kupata majibu ya mahitaji yao, wakazi wa Marlem pamoja na wakazi kutoka katika vijiji vingine viwili waliamua kutokupiga kura ili kuvuta masikio ya mamlaka dhidi ya masuala yao wanayoyalalamikia.	despite frequently airing their grievances publicly, but failing to get responses to their needs, the residents of marlem, along with residents from two other villages, decided not to vote in order to draw the authorities' attention to the issues they are complaining about.
988	Polling officials came to talk to us, but our decision of not to vote, still stands, added Pandurang.	Wafanyakazi wa tume ya uchaguzi walikuja kuongea nasi kuhusu uamuzi wetu wa kutokupiga kura na msimamo wetu uko pale pale, aliongeza Pandurang.	the election commission workers came to talk to us about our decision not to vote and our stance remains the same, added pandurang.
989	Isidore Fernandes, an opposition (Indian National Congress) member of the legislative assembly of Cancona, also met the locals.	Isidore Fernandes, kiongozi wa upinzani kutoka chama cha (Indian National Congress) ambaye ni mbunge katika bunge la Cancona, pia alikutana na wakazi wa eneo hilo.	isidore fernandes, an opposition leader from the indian national congress party who is a member of parliament in the cancona assembly, also met with residents of the area.
990	After hearing the grievances he assured his support in favour of their agitation.	Baada ya kusikiliza kero zao alieahakikishia kuwa atawasaidia kushughulikia jamjo hilo.	after listening to their complaints, he assured them that he would help them deal with that issue.
991	It is important for any government to provide road, water, and electricity to people.	Ni muhimu kwa serikali yoyote kutengeneza barabara, kusambaza umeme na maji kwa ajili ya watu wao.	it is important for any government to build roads, distribute electricity and water for their people.
992	Till now, all government officials have neglected these facilities in Marlem Village, stated Fernandes.	Mpaka sasa maafida wote wa serikali wamepuuza kutoa huduma hizi katika kijiji cha Marlem, alisema   Fernandes.	so far, all government officials have ignored providing these services in the village of marlem, said fernandes.
993	Boycotting elections is now becoming a way of protest, although voting is not mandatory in India.	Kususia uchaguzi sasa imekuwa kama njia mojawapo ya mgomo, ingawa kupiga kura sio lazima katika nchi ya India.	boycotting elections has now become a form of protest, even though voting is not mandatory in india.
994	Apart from Goa, villages in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, the western state of  Maharashtra, and the eastern state of Odisha are employing this method in order to get pressing issues addressed by the authorities in charge.	Tofauti ya kijiji cha Goa, vijiji vilivyo katika jimbo la Kati Madhya Pradesh, Magharibi jimbo la Maharashtra, na Mashariki jimbo la Odisha wamekuwa wakitumia mbinu hii ili kuweza kufikisha mambo yao muhimu mbele ya viongozi wa mamlaka zinazohusika.	the difference with the village of goa, villages in the central state of madhya pradesh, the western state of maharashtra, and the eastern state of odisha have been using this method to be able to bring their important matters before the leaders of the relevant authorities.
995	So far, none of those boycotts seem to have translated into action on the side of government.	Hata hivyo, hakuna mgomo wowowte kati ya hii ambao umechukuliwa hatua na serikali.	however, there is no strike whatsoever among these that has been addressed by the government.
996	Ultimately, voters are adopting such tactics as a show of frustration towards officials and politicians who often reach out to neglected communities only before elections, in hope of securing their votes, but fail to deliver once the elections are over.	Wapiga kura wengi wameanza kuzoea kutumia mbinu hii kama ishara ya kuonesha hasira zao kwa wanasiasa na maofisa wa serikali ambao huzigeukia jamii walizozitelekeza katika kipindi cha uchaguzi wakiwa ma matumaini ya kupata kura zao, huku wakishindwa kutekeleza ahadi zao baada ya uchaguzi.	many voters have begun to use this method as a sign to express their anger towards politicians and government officials who turn to the communities they have abandoned during the election period in hopes of getting their votes, while failing to fulfill their promises after the election.
997	In the end, if boycotting elections does not heed changes in society, what else can members of neglected communities do to get the attention of those supposed to hear them and take proper action?	Lakini mwishowe, kama Kugomea chaguzi haitaleta mabadiliko katika jamii, je ni kitu gani wanajamii wataamua kufanya ili kuvuta masikio ya wenye mamlaka ambao wanapaswa kusikia sauti zao na kuchukua hatua za utekelezaji?	but ultimately, if boycotting elections will not bring about change in society, what will the community members decide to do to attract the attention of the authorities who should hear their voices and take action?

1003	According to the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA), Amade and Germano were charged with spreading defamatory messages against members of the Mozambican Armed Defence Forces via a Facebook account that announced attacks which occurred in villages in the district of Macomia.	Kulingana na taarifa kutoka kwa Shirikisho la Vyombo Vya Habari Kusini Mwa Afrika(MISA), Amade na Germano walishtakiwa kwa kueneza habari za kuwachafua baadhi ya viongozi wa Jeshi la Wananchi wa Msumbiji kupitia kurasa zao za Facebook ambapo walitangaza kuanza kwa mapigano yaliyotokea katika vijiji vya wilaya ya Macomia.	according to information from the media institute of southern africa (misa), amade and germano were accused of spreading defamatory information about some leaders of the mozambique defense armed forces through their facebook pages, where they announced the start of the fighting that occurred in the villages of the macomia district.
1004	The journalists were released from the provincial jail of Mieze in Pemba, Cabo Delgados capital, and will be on probation as they await trial before the provincial judicial court of Cabo Delgado.	Wanahabari hao waliachiliwa huru kutoka katika gereza la  Mieze huko Pemba, makao makuu ya Cabo Delgado na wapo katika kipindi cha uangalizi wakati wakisubiri kushtakiwa katika mahakama ya hakimu mkazi huko Cabo Delgado.	those journalists were released from mieze prison in pemba, the headquarters of cabo delgado and are under surveillance while awaiting trial in the magistrate's court in cabo delgado.
1005	Their first hearing is scheduled for 17 May.	Kesi imepangwa kusikilizwa kwa mara ya kwanza hapo Mei 17.	the case is scheduled to be heard for the first time on may 17.
1006	Since 2017, groups armed with knives have carried out attacks on villages in Cabo Delgado, burning houses and decapitating residents.	Tangu mwaka 2017, makundi ya watu wenye silaha kama vile visu wamekuwa wakifanya mashambulizi katika vijiji vya Cabo Delgado, wakichoma nyumba  na kuwachinja wakazi.	since 2017, groups of armed people such as those with knives have been carrying out attacks in the villages of cabo delgado, burning houses and slaughtering residents.

1008	To date, no group has publicly claimed responsibility for the attacks.	Mpaka leo hakuna kikundi ambacho kimejitokeza hadharani kukiri kuhusika na mashambulio hayo.	until today, no group has publicly come forward to admit involvement in those attacks.
1009	In December 2018, the newspaper A Carta de Moçambique revealed the existence of a Facebook page, run under a name that appears to have been falsified, that praised the armed groups attacks in Cabo Delgado.	Hapo Disemba 2018 gazeti la  A Carta de Moçambique lilidhihirisha uwepo wa ukurasa wa Facebook, yenye jina ambalo inaonekana ni la kughushi ambapo ukurasa huo unasifu mashambulio ya vikundi vya watu wenye silaha huko Cabo Delgado	in december 2018, the newspaper a carta de moçambique revealed the existence of a facebook page, with a name that appears to be fake, where this page praises the attacks of armed groups in cabo delgado.
1010	It unknown whether or not the accusations against Amade and Germano are concerning this same page.	Haifahamiki kama mashtaka dhidi ya Amade na Germano yanahusishwa na ukurasa huo.	it is not known whether the charges against amade and germano are related to that page.
1011	The journalists defence team says there is no connection between them and any illegal activity via Facebook.	Timu ya utetezi wa wanahabari hao inasema kuwa hakuna uhusiano wowote baina yao na ukurasa huo au vitendo vingine vya uhalifu vinavyofanyika katika kurasa za Facebook.	the defense team for those journalists says there is no connection whatsoever between them and that page or other criminal acts taking place on facebook pages.
1012	The proceedings against the journalists have been marked by irregularities.	Mashtaka dhidi ya wanahabari hawa yamegubikwa na sintofahamu nyingi.	the charges against these journalists have been shrouded in much confusion.
1013	After detaining Amade, the police placed him in military custody.	Baada ya Amade kuwekwa kizuizini, polisi walimweka chini ya ulinzi wa Jeshi la Wananchi.	after amade was detained, the police placed him under the custody of the people's army.
1014	He was put in a military prison, where he spent 12 days incommunicado before being transferred to a civilian prison.	Aliwekwa katika gereza la Kijeshi ambapo alikaa siku 12 bila kufanya mawasiliano yoyote na kisha kuhamishiwa katika gereza la kiraia.	he was placed in a military prison where he stayed for 12 days without making any contact and then transferred to a civilian prison.
1015	The journalists were only charged on 16 April, violating the deadline of 90 days set out in the Mozambican Law of Pre-trial Detention in the case of Abubacar.	Wanahabari hawa walishtakiwa tu ilipofika tarehe 16 Aprili, ikiwa ni ukiukwaji wa utaratibu wa mwisho wa siku 90, kinyume na sheria ya ukamataji na kuwekwa kizuizini ya Msumbiji, katika kesi ya Abubacar.	these journalists were only charged on april 16th, which is a violation of the final 90-day procedure, contrary to the mozambique arrest and detention law, in the case of abubacar.
1016	In court proceedings during their pre-trial detention, both journalists were accused of crimes of violating state secrets through digital means and public incitement to a crime using digital means.	Katika muendelezo wa kesi katika kipindi chao cha kuwa kizuizini wandishi wote kwa pamoja walituhumiwa kwa makosa ya uhalifu wa kuvujisha siri za serikali kupitia mitandao ya kijamii na kuchochea jamii kwa kutumia njia za kidigitali.	in the continuation of the case during their detention period, all the journalists were collectively accused of the crime of leaking government secrets through social media and inciting the community using digital means.
1017	These accusations differ from the formal charges that have now been filed against them, which MISA described as spreading defamatory messages against members of the Mozambican Armed Defence Forces via a Facebook account that announced attacks which occurred in villages in the district of Macomia.	Mashtaka haya yanapishana na mashtaka ya awali yaliyotolewa dhidi yao, ambapo MISA waliyatafsiri kama  kueneza ujumbe wa kuchafua baadhi ya viongozi wa jeshi la wananchi wa Msumbiji kupitia ukurasa wa Facebook ambao ulingaza mashambulio ya watu katika vijiji vya wilaya ya Macomia.	these charges conflict with the initial charges brought against them, where misa interpreted them as spreading a message to tarnish some of the leaders of the mozambique people's army through a facebook page that highlighted attacks on people in the villages of the macomia district.
1018	During the 106 days he spent in prison, Abubacar faced a lack of food and refusal of medical assistance, according to Amnesty International.

Familia yake  waliliambia gazeti la @Verdade kwamba walizuiwa kumtembelea  Abubacar katika kipindi chote alichokuwa kizuizini.	his family told the @verdade newspaper that they were prevented from visiting abubacar throughout the entire period he was in detention.
1020	What has happened to these journalists may be part of a trend of intimidation against media workers in northern Mozambique.	Kilichotokea kwa waandishi hawa wa habari ni sehemu ya muendelezo  wa unyanyaswaji dhidi ya wafanyakazi wa vyombo vya habari Kaskazini mwa Msumbiji.	what happened to these journalists is part of the ongoing harassment against media workers in northern mozambique.
1021	Independent investigative journalist Estácio Valoi was detained in December 2018, also in Cabo Delgado on legally dubious terms.	Mwandishi wa Habari za Uchunguzi wa kujitegemea Estácio Valoi aliwekwa kizuizini  mwezi Disemba 2018,  pia huko Cabo Delgado kwa sababu za kisheria zisizoeleweka.	independent investigative journalist estácio valoi was detained in december 2018, also in cabo delgado for unclear legal reasons.

1031	The fact that he had to endure detention without trial for 106 days before getting bail is unconscionable.	Ukweli ni kwamba amevumilia kuwa kizuizini bila kushtakiwa kwa siku 106 kabla ya dhamana,  sio uungwana aliotendewa.	the truth is that he endured being in detention without being charged for 106 days before bail, it's not a fair treatment he received.

1056	On misconceptions that non-Iranians have about Iran, she explained:	Katika mtazamo mbaya walio nao watu wasio wa-Irani dhidi ya Irani, alifafanua:	in the negative view that non-iranians have against iran, he explained:
1057	When it comes to Iran, I often find myself having to go all the way back to 1979, then explaining the transformations that took place decade-by-decade, just to make sense of the present.	Linapokuja suala la Irani, huwa ninajikuta mara zote nikirudi nyuma mpaka mwaka 1979 kisha naelezea mabadiliko yaliyofanyika muongo baada ya muongo ili kuleta maana ya wakati huu wa sasa.	when it comes to iran, i always find myself going back to 1979 and then explaining the changes that have occurred decade after decade to make sense of the present time.
1058	Its sometimes even hard for Iranians themselves to believe what goes on in Iran, let alone non-Iranians.	Mara nyingine inakuwa vigumu sana hata kwa wa-Irani wenyewe kuelewa kinachoendelea Irani kwa sasa sembuse wasio wa-Irani.	sometimes it becomes very difficult even for the iranians themselves to understand what is happening in iran right now, let alone non-iranians.
1059	This explains why its vital to cover Iran from the bottom up, chronicling the lives of ordinary people.	Hii inaonesha jinsi ilivyo muhimu kuifunika Irani gubigubi, tukiyaweka katika mtiririko maalum maisha ya watu wa kawaida.	this shows how important it is to cover iran thoroughly, putting it in a specific flow of ordinary people's lives.
1060	Covering a country by reporting on the pronouncements of the ruling elite is probably the least interesting or informative kind of journalism.	Tukiifikia nchini kwa kutoa taarifa za wasomi ma wenye mamlaka pekee hilo sio jambo la msingi au muhimu sana kwetu kama wanahabari.	reaching the country by providing information from scholars and those in authority alone is not a fundamental or very important thing to us as journalists.
1061	Thats why even very sophisticated people who follow the news on Iran have no idea what goes on there.	Ndio maana hata watu makini sana wanaofuatilia habari hawaelewi mambo ya msingi yanayotokea nchini Irani.	that's why even very careful people who follow the news don't understand the basic things happening in iran.
1062	Of course if they followed Tehran Bureau though, they would get a very dynamic view.	Ni kweli kama watafuatilia taarifa za kutoka Taasisi ya Tehran basi watapata mtazamo tofauti sana.	it is true that if they follow the reports from the tehran institute, they will get a very different perspective.

Na hii ni kwa sababu wanaharakati wa kike hawakupata majibu ya uhakika: wanawake hawakuwa wakiruhusiwa kuwa majaji lakini sasa wanatumika kama majaji wapelelezi.	and this is because female activists did not get definite answers: women were not allowed to be judges but now they are serving as investigative judges.

Bayana, huku kutaathiri haki za kidijitali  haswa, ufikiaji mtandao, haki ya kufikia maelezo mtandaoni, na haki ya kutumia lugha zao asilia kutengeneza, kushiriki, na kusambaza taarifa na maarifa kupitia mtandao.	afterwards, this will affect digital rights, specifically, internet access, the right to access online information, and the right to use their native languages to create, share, and distribute information and knowledge through the internet.
1279	It is thus vital to put in place formidable action plans that will foster the development of ICT applications and services, as well as the use of local languages, to guarantee digital inclusion for all.	Hivyo ni muhimu kuweka mikakati itakayoendeleza utengenezaji wa programu za TEHAMA na huduma, vile vile utumiaji wa lugha asilia, ili kuhakikisha ujumuishwaji wa kidijitali kwa wote.	therefore, it is important to establish strategies that will promote the development of ict programs and services, as well as the use of native languages, to ensure digital inclusion for all.
1280	This, complemented by actions such as localization of digital training and learning materials, and rural ICT literacy programs, is likely to spur a digital revolution, hence promoting digital rights of internet users and bridging the digital divide.	Hatua hii, ikihimiliwa na juhudi zenginezo kama vile ujanibishaji wa vifaa vya kufunzia na kujifunzia, na mipango ya kusoma na kuandika ya TEHAMA vijijini, inaweza kuchochea mapinduzi ya kidijitali, na hivyo basi kukuza haki za kidijitali za watumizi wa mtandao na kuziba pengo la mgawanyiko wa kidijitali.	this step, supported by other efforts such as the localization of teaching and learning materials, and ict literacy programs in rural areas, could spur a digital revolution, thereby promoting the digital rights of internet users and bridging the digital divide gap.
1281	Ultimately, this process will hasten the protection, respect and promotion of  all African and minority languages on the internet as enunciated in the principles of the African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedom.	Hatimaye, mchakato huu utaharakisha ulindwaji, uheshimiwaji na ukuzaji lugha zote za Kiafrika na lugha zingenezo ndogo mtandaoni kama inavyoafikiwa katika kanuni za Azimio la Afrika la Haki za mtandao na Uhuru.	finally, this process will accelerate the protection, respect and promotion of all african languages and other minor languages online as agreed in the principles of the african declaration on internet rights and freedoms.

1339	In the early morning of November 15, 2017, Zimbabweans woke up to the news that former strongman, the late Robert Mugabe, had been deposed in a coup d'etat, and was under house arrest with his family at the presidential residence, State House.	Mapema asubuhi ya Novemba 15, 2017, raia wa Zimbabwe waliamka na habari zilizoenea kwamba aliyekuwa mbabe, marehemu Robert Mugabe, alikuwa amengolewa madarakani katika mapinduzi ya serikali, na alikuwa nguvuni kwenye makazi yake, Ikulu, pamoja na familia yake.	early in the morning of november 15, 2017, the citizens of zimbabwe woke up to the widespread news that the former strongman, the late robert mugabe, had been ousted from power in a government coup, and was under house arrest at his residence, the state house, along with his family.
1340	Major General Sibusiso Moyo, now foreign affairs minister, announced on state television that the president was safe under state custody and that the situation has moved to another level.	Meja Jenerali Sibusiso Moyo, ambaye kwa sasa ni waziri wa mambo ya nje, alitangaza kwenye runinga ya taifa kuwa rais huyo alikuwa salama chini ya ulinzi wa serikali na kwamba hali ya mambo iko katika ngazi nyingine.	general sibusiso moyo, who is currently the foreign affairs minister, announced on national television that the president was safe under government protection and that the situation was at another level.
1341	Almost immediately following General Moyos announcement, Zimbabweans fervently took to social media  in particular, WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook  to get updates on the situation.	Mara tu baada ya tangazo hilo la Jenerali Moyo, raia wa Zimbabwe walimiminika kwa msisimko mkubwa kwenye mitandao ya kijamii  hasa WhatsApp, Twitter na Facebook  ili kupata taarifa mpya kuhusu hali hiyo.	immediately after that announcement by general moyo, the citizens of zimbabwe flooded onto social media platforms especially whatsapp, twitter and facebook in great excitement to get new information about the situation.
1342	This newfound popularity of social media to access information and mobilise protests took root for the first time among Zimbabweans, when protesters took to the streets and helped push Mugabe out of office.	Kwa mara ya kwanza, umaarufu mpya wa mitandao ya kijamii kuwezesha kupata habari na kuhamasisha maandamano ulimea mizizi miongoni mwa raia wa Zimbabwe, wakati waandamanaji walipoingia mitaani na kusaidia kushinikiza kuondolewa kwa Mugabe madarakani.	for the first time, the new popularity of social media enabling access to information and encouraging protests took root among the citizens of zimbabwe, when protesters took to the streets and helped push for the removal of mugabe from power.
1343	The new government, led by Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, took notice of social medias power.	Serikali mpya, iliyoongozwa na Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa,ilingamua mara nguvu ya  mitandao ya kijamii.	the new government, led by emmerson dambudzo mnangagwa, immediately recognized the power of social networks.
1344	As a former state security minister, Mnangagwa also appreciated the importance and value of disinformation in Zimbabwes political terrain.	Kama waziri wa zamani wa usalama wa nchi, Mnangagwa pia alitambua umuhimu na nafasi ya  upotoshaji taarifa katika nyanja za kisiasa za Zimbabwe.	as a former minister of national security, mnangagwa also recognized the importance and role of misinformation in the political spheres of zimbabwe.
1345	In a calculated move to consolidate newfound political power and ensure an electoral victory during the presidential and legislative elections scheduled for next year, Mnangagwa instructed his ruling ZANU PF (Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front) party youth league to enter the social media and online firmament and batter the opponent, back in March 2018.	Mnamo mwezi Machi, 2018, kwa kutambua mara na ili kujitwalia mamlaka ya kisiasa yaliyojianika mbele yake na ili kuhakikisha ushindi katika uchaguzi wa rais na wabunge katika mwaka uliofuatia, Mnangagwa aliamuru umoja wa vijana wa chama tawala cha  ZANU PF (Zimbabwe National Union-Patriotic Front) kujimwaga katika mitandao ya kijamii na mtandaoni na kuwachafua na kuwashambulia wapinzani.	in march 2018, recognizing the political power that lay before him and in order to secure victory in the presidential and parliamentary elections in the following year, mnangagwa ordered the youth wing of the ruling party, zanu pf (zimbabwe national union-patriotic front), to flood social networks and the internet to tarnish and attack opponents.
1346	In post-Mugabe Zimbabwe, this has exacerbated a mis- and disinformation crisis, leaving Zimbabweans with few credible and accurate sources of information to stay informed about the countrys transition and and anti-government protests.	Katika Zimbabwe baada ya Mugabe, mpango wake huu umeimarisha mgogoro wa upotoshaji na utoaji taarifa zisizo za kweli, na hivyo kuwaacha Wazimbabwe na vyanzo vichache tu vya kuaminika vya kupata habari na kujua kuhusu yanayoendelea katika kipindi cha mpito na maandamano ya kupinga serikali.	in zimbabwe after mugabe, his plan has exacerbated the crisis of misinformation and the dissemination of false information, thus leaving zimbabweans with only a few reliable sources of news and knowledge about what is happening during the transition period and protests against the government.
1347	While the new government decried fake news pertaining to any news circulated on social media that they perceived to threaten the countrys status quo, it also deployed tactics aimed at misleading the public about its handling of anti-government protests.	Wakati ambapo serikali mpya ilijidai kulaani habari za uongo  kwa taarifa zilizosambazwa kwenye mitandao ya kijamii na ambazo waliziona kuwa tishio utawala ulio madarakani,  pia ilifanya hila ilikuupotosha umma kuhusu namna ilivyoshughulika na maandamano ya kuipinga serikali.	at a time when the new government claimed to condemn fake news for reports spread on social media and which they saw as a threat to the incumbent regime, it also tricked the public about how it dealt with anti-government protests.

1349	Zimbabwe has witnessed a significant rise in mobile internet and social media usage over the past few years.	Zimbabwe imeshuhudia ongezeko kubwa la matumizi ya intaneti kwenye simu za mkononi na mitandao ya kijamii katika miaka michache iliyopita.	zimbabwe has witnessed a significant increase in internet usage on mobile phones and social networks in the past few years.
1350	The internet penetration rate increased by 41.1 percent, from 11 percent of the population to 52.1 percent between 2010 and 2018, while mobile phone penetration increased by 43.8 percent from 58.8 percent to 102.7 percent over the same period.	Kiwango cha kuenea kwa intaneti kiliongezeka kwa asilimia 41.1, kutoka asilimia 11 ya idadi ya watu hadi asilimia 52.1 kati ya 2010 na 2018, wakati kuenea kwa simu za mkononi kuliongezeka kwa asilimia 43.8 kutoka asilimia 58.8 hadi asilimia 102.7 kwa kipindi hicho hicho.	the spread of the internet increased by 41.1 percent, from 11 percent of the population to 52.1 percent between 2010 and 2018, while the spread of mobile phones increased by 43.8 percent from 58.8 percent to 102.7 percent over the same period.
1351	This means that half the population is now connected to the internet, compared to only 11 percent in 2010.	Hii inamaanisha kuwa nusu ya idadi ya watu sasa imeunganishwa na intaneti, ikilinganishwa na asilimia 11 tu katika mwaka 2010.	this means that half of the population is now connected to the internet, compared to just 11 percent in 2010.
1352	However, mis- and disinformation have found fertile ground to flourish owing to a variety of factors: extreme polarisation in the media, proposed government controls over social media, poor official communication methods and low digital literacy among internet users.	Hata hivyo, upotoshaji na utoaji taarifa za uongo nao vimepata mazingira ya kushamiri kwa sababu kadhaa: mgawanyiko mkubwa katika vyombo vya habari, mapendekezo ya serikali kudhibiti mitandao ya kijamii, njia hafifu za mawasiliano rasmi na na elimu duni miongoni mwa watumiaji wa intaneti.	however, distortion and dissemination of false information have thrived due to several reasons: a significant division in the media, government proposals to control social networks, weak official communication methods, and poor education among internet users.
1353	During the anti-government protests of January 2019, when state security forces arrested and beat hundreds of protesters, news of these clampdowns competed with government claims of fake news or their absolute denial.	Wakati wa maandamano dhidi ya serikali ya Januari 2019, kipindi vikosi vya usalama vya serikali vilipowakamata na kuwashambulia mamia ya waandamanaji, habari za ukandamizaji huu zilishindana na madai ya serikali kwamba zilikuwa habari za uongo au pale ilipokanusha kabisa kuwepo kwake.	during the protests against the government in january 2019, when government security forces arrested and attacked hundreds of protesters, news of this oppression competed with the government's claims that they were fake news or when it completely denied its existence.
1354	The government restricted access to internet services to disrupt the flow of information and contribute to widespread confusion.	Serikali ilizuia upatikanaji wa huduma za intaneti ili kuvuruga mtiririko wa habari na hivyo kuleta mkanganyiko mkubwa.	the government blocked access to internet services to disrupt the flow of information and thus cause great confusion.
1355	They and their supporters also resorted to public misinformation about the protests and discredited any truthful information or reports as fake news.	Viongozi wa serikali na wafuasi wao pia walitumia mbinu ya kupotosha taarifa kuhusu maandamano hayo na kupenyeza mashaka katika taarifa zozote zilizokuwa za weli kwa kuzipachika jina la habari za uongo.	government leaders and their followers also used the tactic of distorting information about the protests and sowing doubt in any true reports by labeling them as fake news.
1356	In Zimbabwe, citizens usually regard general statements issued by government ministers as official policy.	Kwa kawaida, nchini Zimbabwe,  raia huzichukulia taarifa zozote zitolewazo na mawaziri wa serikali kama ndio sahihi.	usually, in zimbabwe, citizens take any information provided by government ministers as correct.
1357	For example, Deputy Information Minister Energy Mutodi sought to convince people that everything was normal and that videos and images of the military patrolling the streets were the work of a few rogue individuals.	Kwa mfano, Naibu Waziri wa Habari Energy Mutodi alijitokeza kuwashawishi watu kuwa kila kitu kilikuwa shwari na kwamba video na picha za wanajeshi waliokuwa wakipiga doria mitaani zilitengenezwa na wahuni wachache.	for example, deputy minister of information energy mutodi emerged to persuade people that everything was calm and that the videos and photos of soldiers patrolling the streets were made by a few hooligans.
1358	Mutodi further misled the nation when he claimed on state television that there was no internet shutdown but rather a congested network.	Mutodi alizidi kupotosha taifa pale alipodai kwenye runinga ya taifa kwamba hakukuwepo na uzimwaji wa intaneti bali kulikuwa na msongamano katika mtandao.	mutodi continued to mislead the nation when he claimed on national television that there was no internet shutdown, but rather there was congestion on the network.
1359	In another suspected case of possible government-sanctioned disinformation, millions of people remained cut off from social media during the January protests.	Katika kisa kingine kinachoshukiwa kuwa ni upotoshaji habari unaoungwa mkono na serikali, mamilioni wa watu walizimiwa mitandao ya kijamii wakati wa maandamano ya Januari.	in another case suspected to be government-backed misinformation, millions of people were cut off from social media during the january protests.
1360	Others downloaded Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications to stay informed, but messages circulated that downloading such applications would lead to arrests, creating further panic and apprehension.	Wengine walipakua zana za  huduma ya kubaki hewani kwa ushirika inayojulikana kama Virtual Private Network (VPN) ili kuendelea kuhabarika, hata hivyo taarifa ilisambazwa kwamba kupakua zana kama hizo kungesababisha kukamatwa, hali iliyozidi kusababisha hofu na taharuki.	others downloaded tools of a service known as virtual private network (vpn) to stay informed, however, information was circulated that downloading such tools could lead to arrest, a situation that further caused fear and panic.
1361	When in March 2019, Human Rights Watch (HRW) tweeted a report denouncing the governments use of horrific violence during the January 2019 protests, government supporters took to Twitter to discredit and attack HRW.	Mwezi Machi 2019, wakati Shirika la Haki za Kibinadamu (HRW) lilichapisha kwa twiti ripoti iliyolaani matumizi ya ukatili wa kutisha wa serikali kudhibiti maandamano ya Januari 2019, wafuasi wa serikali walitumia Twita kulichafua na kulishambulia shirika hilo la HRW.	in march 2019, when the human rights watch (hrw) tweeted a report condemning the government's horrific use of violence to control the january 2019 protests, government supporters used twitter to smear and attack the hrw organization.
1362	One user tweeted that the organization is spreading blatant lies and described HRW as neo-colonial organization hired to malign innocent countries to push the US's hegemonic goals.	Mtumiaji mmoja alituma ujumbe wa twita kuwa shirika hilo lilikuwa linaeneza uongo wa waziwazi na kuliita kuwa lilikuwashirika la ukoloni mamboleo  lililopewa kazi ya kuzishinikiza nchi zisizo na hatia ili zitetee malengo ya kibeberu Marekani.	one user tweeted a message that the organization was spreading blatant lies and called it a neo-colonial organization given the task of pressuring innocent countries to defend the imperialist goals of america.
1363	Another repeated government claims and blamed the violence on rogue elements who are trying [sic] destroy the image of the president.	Mwingine alirejelea madai ya serikali na kulalama kuwa vurugu hizo zilitokana na wahuni ambao walikuwa wanajaribu [sic] kumchafulia rais .	another person reiterated the government's claims and complained that the riots were caused by hooligans who were trying to tarnish the president's reputation.
1364	And disinformation about government policies and other events of public interest have continued well beyond the January protests.	Na upotoshaji kuhusu sera za serikali na matukio mengine yenye maslahi ya umma zimeendelea kukithiri baada ya maandamano ya Januari.	and the distortion about government policies and other events of public interest continue to increase after the january protests.
1365	Most recently, ruling party ZANU PF members took to Twitter to misinform the public about the disappearance of Dr. Peter Magombey, acting president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA).	Hivi karibuni, wanachama wa chama tawala cha ZANU PF walitumia mtandao wa Twita kuupotosha umma kuhusu kutoweka kwa Dk.Peter Magombey, ambaye ni kaimu Rais wa Chama cha Madaktari wa Hospitali za Zimbabwe (ZHDA).	recently, members of the ruling zanu pf party used twitter to mislead the public about the disappearance of dr. peter magombey, who is the acting president of the zimbabwe hospital doctors association (zhda).

Hata hivyo, kinachosubiriwa ni kuona ikiwa taarifa za dawa ya kutibu ugonjwa wa Ebola iliyogunduliwa na Mwafrika kutoka Jamhuri ya Kidemokrasia ya Congo inayotibu gonjwa hili la Kiafrika itapewa nafasi kwenye vyombo vya habari kama ilivyokuwa mwaka 2017.	however, what is awaited is to see if the news of the ebola treatment drug discovered by an african from the democratic republic of congo that treats this african disease will be given a chance in the media as it was in 2017.
