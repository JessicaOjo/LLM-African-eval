Di movement get hope say afta 10 years,herders wey dey waka up and down mainly go get mind to dey put dey put dia cattle inside ranch and reserve for public grazin, wia breedin farms and oda mechanised livestock management go support wetin di sector go produce	the movement is hopeful that after 10 years, nomadic herders will be inclined to keep their cattle in ranches and reserves for public grazing, where breeding farms and other mechanised livestock management will support what the sector produces.

222	The federal government, which has committed to funding 80 per cent of the transformation proposals submitted by participating states, has taken preliminary steps toward putting the Plan into practice, including providing technical support to help states prepare for implementation, such as help with field surveys and site mapping.	Di Federal Goment wey get mind to drop moni wey go carry like 80 percent of di Transformation proposal wey di states wey dey involve submit, don dey take di first step to practice wetin dem plan, wey go include technical support wey go help dem state prepare to start work, tins like field survey and site mappin.	the federal government, which intends to fund about 80 percent of the transformation proposals submitted by the involved states, has begun to implement its plans. this includes providing technical support to help these states prepare to commence work, such as field surveys and site mapping.

229	In many states, especially in the North-West, the proliferation of criminal gangs and other armed groups is cutting off access to grazing reserves and scaring away potential investors.

230	Unless addressed, these and other problems could delay or even scuttle the Plan, leaving the country vulnerable to an escalation of herder-farmer conflict, which could degenerate into wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.	unless dey do somethin about am, dis kasala and oda ones fit delay or make e spoil di plan, wey go make di kontri dey helpless wen di fight between farmers and herders dey serious pass before own, wey fit kom turn fight between ethnic group, region and religion	unless something is done about it, this crisis and others could delay or ruin the plan, which could leave the country helpless when the conflict between farmers and herders becomes more severe than before, potentially leading to conflicts between ethnic groups, regions, and religions.
231	Tackling these challenges requires a concerted effort by federal and state authorities, with help from donors and investors.	To tackle dis kasala,e go dey important make Federal and State authority join hand make effort, wit donors and investors help.	to address this issue, it will be important for the federal and state authorities to collaborate and make efforts, with the help of donors and investors.
232	First, Abuja and supportive state governments should provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispel misgivings and misperceptions about the Plan.	First, make Abuja and oda states wey dey support am provide political leadership wey strong pass before, make dey kom increase dia communication wit public, so dem go fit spoil pipo doubt and wrong understanding of di plan	firstly, abuja and other states that support it should provide stronger political leadership than before, and they should increase their communication with the public, so they can dispel people's doubts and misunderstandings about the plan.
233	These are especially prevalent among pastoralists, who will be asked to change a centuries-old nomadic lifestyle, and who legitimately doubt the Plans promises about available pasture.	Dis one dey common pass for pastoralists dia side, wey go ask dem make dem change dia nomadic lifestlye wey dey wit dia pipo for centuries, wey still get serious doubt say di plan promise about pasture na lie.	this one is more common among pastoralists, who are asked to change their nomadic lifestyle that has been with their people for centuries, and who still have serious doubts that the plan's promise about pasture is a lie.
234	But many farmers are fearful too, that they may lose land to livestock producers.	But many farmers dey fear say dem go lose dia land give pipo wey dey produce livestock.	but many farmers are afraid that they will lose their land to people who produce livestock.
235	Many in the Middle Belt and southern states remain deeply suspicious of the Plans long-term goals, which they see as creating privileges for herders, and more broadly, the Fulani.	Many pipo for di middle Belt and oda states for di South still dey suspect di plan long-term goals, wey dem dey see as opportunity for herders and di Fulani people particularly	many people in the middle belt and other states in the south still suspect the long-term goals of the plan, which they see as an opportunity for herders and the fulani people in particular.
236	With Abuja and other partners support, state governments must build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processing.	Wit di support from Abuja and oda partners, state goments go need find pipo wey go be expert, wey go know technical aspect of thins, especially pipo wey go dey manage di ranch and grazin reserve, dairy production and meat processin	with the support from abuja and other partners, state governments will need to find people who will be experts, who will understand the technical aspects of things, especially people who will manage the ranch and grazing reserve, dairy production and meat processing.
237	Federal and state governments should also up budgetary commitments, hasten the release of funds and provide financial transparency to ensure accountability, working with donors and investors as necessary.

238	Addressing rural insecurity, curbing impunity and rehabilitating communities adversely affected by earlier violence in participating states are also vital.	E dey important sef to dey deal wit insecurities wey dey rural area, to dey curb impunity and to dey kom rehabilitate communities wey di fight affect seriously for di states wey dey participate.	it is even important to address insecurities in rural areas, to curb impunity and to rehabilitate communities that the conflict has seriously affected in the participating states.
239	Plus, authorities will need to consider climate changes likely impact and reach a decision about how the transhumant herders who cross into Nigeria seasonally should or should not benefit from the Plan.	Authorities go need consider weather change mata join, make dem decide if herders from oda kontris sometimes go benefit from di plan sef	authorities will need to consider the issue of climate change as well, to determine if herders from other countries might sometimes benefit from the plan too.
240	While some of these steps will take time, the Plans proponents should focus on delivering concrete, visible results on a relatively short-term basis.	As some of dis step go take time,make di pipo wey dey plan am focus on how dem go fit bring result wey strong, wey pipo go fit see for small time	since some of these steps will take time, the people planning them should focus on how they can achieve solid results that can be seen in a short period of time.
241	Less than two years from now, the country will hold general elections.	less dan two years from now, di kontri go hold general election	in less than two years from now, the country will hold a general election.
242	If the Plan is to survive the change of government that will follow, politicians may need to be able to produce clear proof of its benefits (Having served two terms, President Buhari and many state governors are ineligible to compete, meaning that change is certain.)	if di plan go survive di change of goment wey go follow, Politians go need bring proof wey clear say e get benefit (Change dey certain, as president Buhari and many state governor dem no go fit compete again as dey don serve two term)	if the plan is to survive the change of government that will follow, politicians will need to provide clear evidence that it has benefits. (change is certain, as president buhari and many state governors cannot compete again having served two terms)
243	Ideally, by the time campaigning heats up in late 2022, the Plans backers should be able to point to at least a handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated reserves, strong donor and investor commitments, and the first of a cadre of newly trained livestock management professionals.

482	The passage of this Bill by the National Assembly, no doubt, is a clear demonstration of its patriotic zeal and the need to further strengthen all national efforts geared towards the fight against corruption, which has hindered development in every aspect of our national lives.
