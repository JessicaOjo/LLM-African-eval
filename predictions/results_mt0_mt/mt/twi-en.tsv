The national crime commissioner called Opare-Addo several times to explain why he refused to resign.</s>
144	Mr Dapaah further explained “Meanwhile, his continuous stay in office obstructed the work of the new regional security liaison officer. Against this backdrop, personnel from the ministry of national security were on 11th May 2021 dispatched to the Ashanti region to ascertain the reason for DCOP Opare Addo’s refusal to vacate his office. And if it became necessary to change the locks of the door to his office. On arrival, the personnel duly introduced themselves but were met with acts of hostility from DCOP Opare-Addo, including drawing his sidearm.

When the policemen arrived, they protested against DCOP Opare-Addo and he did not like them. They asked him to pay them back.</s>

1472	The bikes also serve as a cheap source of transportation as they are less expensive.	Esiane sɛ ne boɔ yɛ fo nti no dodoɔ no ara pɛ ne fa	<pad> Because she is very beautiful, most of the people like her.</s>
1473	They also come in handy because of the absence of an efficient and reliable public transport system.	Sɛ kaa nni a pragya ne okada yi ara na wɔdwane kɔtoa no	<pad> If there were no cars, they would have run to the dumping site by foot.</s>
1474	However, many people abhor okada and pragya because of the nuisance they create on the roads and most particularly the lack of respect for traffic regulations.	Nanso nnipa pii no ara na ɛmpɛ okada ne pragya esiane dede ne atuturasɛm a wɔdi no akwan so nti no	<pad> But a lot of people don't like either the okada or the pragya because of the noise and gossip that they make through them.</s>
1475	The high incidence of accidents and fatalities associated with the reckless use of Okada, is also disturbing.	Akwanhyia ahodoɔ a ɛnam okada so ɛba no yɛ adeɛ a ɛwɔ sɛ ani kɔ ho	<pad> The number of accidents caused by bicycles is something to be taken seriously.</s>
1476	Indeed, many organisations, including the Ghana Medical Association and the National Road Safety Authority, have called for a total ban on their usage as a mode of transport in the country.

1477	This has left the country in a deep-blue sea.	Wei ato ɔman no agyaagyaa mu	<pad> Because of this, the country has been weakened.</s>
1478	This is because, despite the existence of the law banning their use for commercial purposes, they are a major source of relief to many Ghanaians.	Aba saa no sei ɛfiri sɛ ɛmmfa ho ne mmara a wɔahyɛ de atua saa nnoɔma yi, abɛyɛ ahotɔsoɔ ama Ghanafoɔ pii	<pad> However, despite the tax and the law imposed to regulate this practice, it has become a source of pride for many Ghanaians.</s>
1479	For us at the Daily Graphic, we think that the country should relook at the law comprehensively and come up with the most appropriate measures that will suit the needs of the population in line with best practice.	Yɛn a yɛwɔ Daily Graphic ha deɛ yɛsusu sɛ ɔman no hwɛ mmara no bio na yɛhwɛ akwan pa a yɛbɛtumi afa ama saa dwumadie yi akɔ so	<pad> We at Daily Graphic think the government should review the law and look for ways to keep this journalism going.</s>
1480	In India, for instance, pragya is a major means of transport but we have not heard of complaints as we have in Ghana.	Sɛ wokɔ India a pragya na ɛdi akɔtene wɔ wɔn akɔneabadie mu nanso yɛntee nsɛmnsɛm fa ho te sɛ deɛ yɛte no Ghana no	<pad> If you were in India, Pragya was the leading city of their culture but we didn't hear about it as much as we did about Ghana.</s>

1482	We need to bear in mind that with the increasing rate of unemployment, the okada and tricycle operators see it as a source of income which caters for them and their families.	ɛwɔ sɛ yɛde hyɛ yɛn adwene mu sɛ esiane adwumasɛm a ayɛ den nti wɔn wɔtwi okada ne pragya hu no sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a wɔbɛnya afiri mu de ahwɛ wɔn ho ne wɔn abusuafoɔ	<pad> We should remember that due to the difficult economic situation, many people who are struggling to find work have turned to illegal and unlicensed employment as a way to support themselves and their families.</s>
1483	But as of now, okadas and pragyas are a nuisance and we at the Daily Graphic believe that with education, regulation and enforcement of the appropriate regimes, the operators must be made to conform if it is established that the country cannot do without them.	Seesei ara okada ne pragya abɛyɛ ɔhaw ne ateetee na yɛn yɛwɔ Daily Graphic susu sɛ yɛma wɔn nteteeɛ ne yɛyɛ nhyehyɛeɛ a wɔbɛfa so aka afidie no a ɛbɛboa ama ɔman no akɔ so	<pad> Nowadays, tobacco and cannabis have become a problem and a threat and we at Daily Graphic think that we should provide them with advice and make plans to fight the addictions that will help the country move forward.</s>
1484	In reviewing the current law or system under which they operate, professional training, a licensing regime both for the rider and motorcycle/motor tricycles as well an insurance cover to cater for accidents will be most appropriate.

1485	With such a system in place, it will be easier for the Ghana Police Service to enforce the law and also deal with unregistered motorbikes and motor tricycles as well as those involved in criminal activities.	Sɛ wɔde nhyehyɛeɛ no gu akwan mu a ɛbɛboa ama Ghana Polisifoɔ no ahyɛ mmara no kena na aboa ma wɔakye okada ne pragya a wɔde di krɔno no	<pad> If the proposal is implemented, it will help the Ghana Police to comply with the law and enable them to acquire drugs and weapons for the use of their force.</s>
1486	Currently, Ghanaians are divided over the regularisation of these two major means of transport because of their advantages and disadvantages.	Mprɛmprɛn yi Ghanafoɔ pii no ara na wɔn adwene ayɛ wɔn ntata wɔ saa mmara yi ho esiane ɛho mfaso papa ne bɔne	<pad> Ghanaians have been debating the law for a long time now because of its good and bad effects.</s>
1487	The Daily Graphic believes that if we want to have decency on our roads and improve our transportation system, then we have to comprehensively hold the bull by the horn and address the problem now or never.

1490	Since I came back to Ghana 20 years ago and to the realisation that the reality of our country was very different from what was in the Geography books, this was the most successful attempt at doing something to reverse the catastrophic degradation of our lands.

1491	Five million seedlings were made available by the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for us to plant and there was a joyful atmosphere that I hadn’t noticed for a long time.

1493	Far more than any potholed road, any dilapidated school, any hospital without beds or any schoolchildren without computers and I daresay, even the worst of any rampaging virus, what we should all get and remain agitated about is the state of our land, the land that had lost its forest cover, the rivers that are drying up, what used to be a wet month of May turning out hot and totally dry.
