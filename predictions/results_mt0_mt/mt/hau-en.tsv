43	There are a few points that I should mention before answering this question.	Don amsa wannan tambaya, da farko dai wajibi ne a yi karin bayani kan wasu batutuwa.	<pad> To answer this question, it is necessary to clarify some points first.</s>
44	First of all, hajj â€“ which is an Islamic obligation â€“ pursues great goals.	Da farko shi kansa aikin hajji wanda daya ne daga cikin ayyukan ibada na Musulunci, yana da wasu manyan manufofi da yake son cimmawa.	<pad> First of all, the Hajj itself, which is one of the major religious ceremonies of Islam, has some important objectives that it seeks to achieve.</s>
45	Based on the Holy Quran, maybe the biggest goal of hajj is the connection between the Islamic Ummah and the activities of the prophets throughout history. That is to say, according to Sura al-Baqara, it began with the creation of Adam and Eve when angels prostrated in front of them, their experiences in paradise, their banishment to earth and finally their use of their heavenly experiences, including committing sins, repenting and complete submission to divine commands.	Mai yiyuwa ne mafi girman manufar da ke cikin aikin hajjin, kamar yadda muka samo hakan cikin Alkur’ani mai girma shi ne ‘alakanta al’ummar musulmi da ayyukan annabawa cikin tarihi’. Wato kamar yadda ya zo cikin Suratul Bakara – wanda mafarinsa daga halittan dan’adam da sujadar Mala’iku gare shi da irin abubuwan da (annabi) Adamu ya gani a cikin aljanna, sannan daga baya kuma da zuwansa bayan kasa da kuma amfani da irin kwarewar da ya samu a Aljanna wanda ya hada da saba wa doka da kuma tuba da komawa ga Allah Madaukakin Sarki.	<pad> Maybe the greatest purpose of Hajj, as we found it in the holy Quran, is to connect the Muslim community with the history of the Prophets. That is, as it comes in the Suratul Baqara - which begins with the creation of Adam and the worship of the angels to him and the things that Adam saw in paradise, and then afterwards with his return to earth and using the experiences he had in paradise which included transgressions and repentance and returning to God Most High.</s>
46	In order to describe each of these stages, the Holy Quran uses the phrase â€œand whenâ€ which recount the story of all prophets until Prophet Ibrahim when God says, â€œAnd when his Lord tried Ibrahim with certain words, he fulfilled them.	Alkur’ani mai girma yayi bayanin kowane guda daga cikin wadannan lokuta yana mai cewa: ‘kuma a lokacin da’ ‘kuma a lokacin da’ ‘kuma a lokacin da’, dukkanin wadannan ‘kuma a lokacin da’din suna bin diddigin tafarkin annabawa ne har zuwa lokacin da aka zo ga annabi Ibrahim a nan ne ya ce: “Kuma a lokacin da Ubangijin Ibrahim Ya jarrabe shi da wasu kalmomi, sai ya cika masa su.	<pad> And when the Lord of Abraham tested him with some words, and he fulfilled them for him.</s>
47	He said: Surely I will make you an Imam of men.	Ya ce: “Lalle ne Ni, Mai sanya ka shugaba domin mutane ne.”	"<pad> He said: ""I am the Lord, who made me chief for the people.</s>"
48	My covenant does not include the unjust, said He.â€ [The Holy Quran, 2: 124] It refers to the leadership of God's righteous servants. â€œMy covenant does not include the unjust, said He.â€ This is where the issue of hajj is mentioned: â€œAnd when We made the House a pilgrimage for men and a (place of) security, and: Appoint for yourselves a place of prayer on the standing-place of Ibrahim.â€ God brings up the issue of hajj in the middle of the story about the path of His prophets and it appears that Prophet Ibrahim is considered the one who determines the path and the goals of hajj.	Ya ce: “Kuma da zuriyata”, wato yayi bayanin shugabancin salihai ne.	"<pad> He said: ""Kuma da zuriyata"", meaning the successor of the caliphs.</s>"
49	The second goal has also been mentioned: making human beings go back to their nature and to the natural path of surrendering to God. And this goal is manifested in all rituals of hajj. Therefore, hajj contains great goals and one of these goals is renouncing polytheists [bara'a] and Prophet Ibrahim was the most important manifestation of renouncing polytheists.	A dabi’ance manufa ta biyu wadda kuma take bisa wannan tafarkin ita ce samar da dan’adam (na hakika), mayar da dan’adam zuwa ga asalin tsarinsa da kuma tafarkinsa na asali na mika kai ga Ubangiji.

"<pad> The second purpose of this path is to recreate the human (authentically), return the human to his original nature and his original way of submitting to God. This type of recreation can be achieved during Hajj. Therefore, the main purposes of Hajj have been described, one of them being the ""pursuit of the dhimmis.""</s>"
50	All these things show the unity of Muslims and the Islamic Ummah. These goals are realized during hajj.	Dukkanin wadannan abubuwa ne da suke nuni da dakaitakan mutane da kuma hadin kan al’ummar musulmi.	<pad> All these things show the people's solidarity and the unity of the Muslim community.</s>
51	A manifestation of these goals is mentioned in every one of the messages issued by Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.	Cikin dukkanin irin wadannan sakonni da marigayi Imam (yardar Allah ta tabbata a gare shi) da Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci (Allah ya kara masa tsawon rai) suke fitarwa, su kan yi ishara da wadannan manufofi na hajji ne.	<pad> In all these messages that the late Imam (may Allah be pleased with him) and the Leader of the Islamic Revolution (May Allah prolong his life) have sent, they often refer to these Hajj objectives.</s>
52	Reviving hajj means reviving the Islamic Ummah and this is the philosophy behind the existence of these messages and the insistence of the Islamic Republic and the Leader on this issue.	Amma dangane da falsafar da ke cikin wannan sakon – wanda shi ne da man tambayar da ka yi – da kuma dalilin da ya sanya Jamhuriyar Musulunci da jagoranta su ke ba wa wannan lamarin irin wannan muhimmancin shi ne cewa rayar da aikin aiki, rayar da al’umma ne.	<pad> But regarding the philosophy of this message - which is the basis of your question - and why the Islamic Republic and its leader are so important to this issue is that promoting work is promoting the people.</s>
53	Implementing the hajj messages would initiate the movement of the Islamic Ummah.	Tabbatar da sakon hajji yana nufin tabbatar da yunkurin al’umma ne.	<pad> Confirming the message of Hajj means confirming the effort of the community.</s>
54	According to Islamic narrations, â€œHajj is the flag of Islam.â€ What does â€œflag of Islamâ€ mean?	Ya zo cikin riwaya cewa: Hajji tutar Musulunci ne’. Me ake nufi da tutar Musulunci?	<pad> It is said in a Hadith that Hajj is the flag of Islam. What is the meaning of the flag of Islam?</s>
55	As long as the flag of an army keeps flying during a battle, it means the army is has not been defeated and the battle is supposed to continue.	A lokacin yaki, a duk lokacin da tuta ta zamanto a dage, hakan yana nufin sojoji suna nan da ransu kuma ana ci gaba da yaki.	<pad> During war, whenever the flag is up, it means the soldiers are alive and the fight is continuing.</s>
56	Therefore, reviving hajj is one of the great goals that the Islamic Republic pursues in order to bring about Islamic Awakening.	A saboda haka rayar da hajji da kuma komawa zuwa ga ruhin hajji da hakan, daya ne daga cikin manyan manufofin Jamhuriyar Musulunci na tabbatar da ‘farkawa ta Musulunci’.	"<pad> For this reason, celebrating Hajj and returning to the spirit of Hajj is one of the main objectives of the Islamic Republic to ensure the ""Islamic revolution.""</s>"
57	In the messages which have been issued by Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, these points have been frequently highlighted.

58	Yes, unfortunately we have failed to understand the importance of the hajj messages. We have failed to make others realize the importance of these messages. We have also failed to convey these messages to those who are far from us.	- To amma daga dukkanin alamu ba a ba wa wannan lamari na sakon hajji muhimmancin da ya kamata wajen yada shi ba. Na’am.

Yes. It is sad that we can't understand the magnitude of this message, let alone understand it for others who are far away.</s>
59	Our mass media, our pilgrims and others are making efforts in this regard, but these efforts are not enough considering the importance of these messages.

65	The two sides agreed that Iranian pilgrims should not come together in Mecca and that they could only do so on the day of Arafa to listen to the message of their Leader.

66	No, the agreement to recite Dua Kumeyl in Medina was reached in other negotiations. This agreement was a separate issue, which was settled after a lot of conflicts and groundwork.

82	During hajj the pilgrims are representatives of the entire Islamic Ummah.	A wajen dai alhazai wakilan dukkanin al’ummar musulmi ne.	<pad> The ahajis are representatives of all Muslims.</s>
83	That is to say, it is the congregation of the entire Islamic Ummah with the purpose of getting closer to God. The pilgrims are trained with slogans, songs and identical rituals.

87	I have extracted the themes of the messages issued by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution over the past few years and I can share the result with you if you like. Please go ahead.	Dangane da hakan ni dai na yi darasin wadannan sakonni na Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci da yake fitarwa cikin shekarun nan, idan har kana so sai in gabatar maka da shi.	<pad> Regarding this, I have studied the messages of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution that he has been issuing in recent years, if you want, I can present it to you.</s>
88	If you study the Leader's messages, you will see that the first point that is raised in these messages is the role of hajj in structuring the Islamic Ummah.	Idan har ka dubi sakonnin Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci da kyau, za ka ga cewa batu na farko da ake gabatar da shi a cikin wannan sakon, shi ne rawar da hajji ya ke takawa wajen gina al’ummar musulmi.	<pad> If you look at the message of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution carefully, you will see that the first point in this message is the role of Hajj in building the Muslim community.</s>
89	This is the goal of the Leader's hajj messages.	Wannan shi ne abin da sakon Jagora ya ke son cimmawa a lokacin hajji.	<pad> That's what the message of Jagora aims to achieve during Hajj.</s>
90	For example, one point that is raised in these messages is the role of hajj in eliminating the weak points of the Islamic Ummah.	A matsayin misali rawar da aikin hajji zai iya takawa wajen cike gurbin raunin da al’ummar musulmi suke da shi.	<pad> For example, the role of Hajj can play in filling in the gaps that Muslim communities have.</s>
91	The next point concerning the role of hajj is that these messages stress the fact that hajj is the flag of Islam.	Batu na gaba a bangaren rawar da hajji ya ke takawa shi ne yana jaddada cewa hajji tutar Musulunci ne.	<pad> The second point in his speech on the role of Hajj is that he stresses that Hajj is a symbol of Islam.</s>
92	In one of his messages, the Leader pointed out that hajj is a manifestation of the movement of the Islamic Ummah and that it defines the role of political Islam.	A cikin daya daga cikin sakonnin Jagora ya yi ishara da cewa hajji ‘alama ce ta yunkurin al’umma’ sannan kuma ‘mai bayanin irin rawar da Musulunci na siyasa yake takawa’ ne.	"<pad> In one of his messages, the leader pointed out that Hajj is an ""alama of the movement of the community"" and ""an indicator of the role that political Islam plays.""</s>"
93	One pillar of hajj is tawaf around the House of God.	Idan har muka lura da tushen aikin hajji, daya daga cikin su shi ne dawafin Dakin Allah.	<pad> If we consider the basis of Hajj, one of them is to visit the House of God.</s>
94	That is to say, the entire Ummah is supposed to revolve around and adhere to the guidance of Allah the Exalted.	Wato dukkanin al’umma suna zagaya shari'a da shiriyarwa ta Ubangiji Madaukakin Sarki da kuma riko da hakan.	<pad> All the people are obeying the law and the teachings of God the Most High and keeping them.</s>
95	In sum, the first pivot that is mentioned in these messages is the role of hajj in the civilizational course of the Islamic Ummah.	A takaice dai batu na farko da ake yin ishara da shi cikin wannan sakon, shi ne ‘rawar aikin hajji cikin tarihin ci gaban al’ummar musulmi’.	<pad> In a nutshell, the first topic of this message is the role of Hajj in the history of the development of the Muslim community.</s>
96	The second issue is the role of hajj in moral education of individuals and society.	Batu na biyu shi ne rawar da aikin hajji yake takawa wajen ‘tarbiyar kyawawan halaye na jama’a da kuma na daidaiku’.	"<pad> The second is the role that Hajj plays in ""cultivating good manners in the community and individual.""</s>"
97	This is a theme that is present in all of the hajj messages.	Hakan kuwa yana cikin dukkanin sakonnin.	<pad> It's in all the messages.</s>
98	The issue of self-purification and appreciating this opportunity in the holy places that are related to hajj, are definitely mentioned somewhere in the messages.	Ko shakka babu tun daga farkon sakon zuwa karshe za a yi ishara da batun tsarkake zuciya da kuma amfanuwa da irin damar da aka samu a wajaje masu tsarki wadanda suke da alaka da aikin hajji.	<pad> No doubt, from the beginning of this message to the end it will refer to purifying the heart and taking advantage of the opportunities that have been available in holy sites related to Hajj.</s>
99	Showing the greatness of Islam and its messages is the third theme that is mentioned in these messages.	Batu na uku a cikin wannan sakon shi ne ‘nuna irin girman da Musulunci yake da shi da kuma sakon da ke tattare da shi’.	"<pad> The third point of this message is ""now the greatness of Islam and its message.""</s>"
100	They highlight the greatness of Islamic solutions to the problems of humanity.	Haka nan da ishara da hanyoyin da Musulunci yake da su na magance matsalolin da bil’adama suke fuskanta.	<pad> He also pointed out the ways Islam has to deal with problems that humanity faces.</s>
101	Highlighting the issue of Muslim unity is another theme that is highlighted in these messages.	Batu na gaba shi ne jaddadawa dangane da batun hadin kan musulmi wanda musamman a cikin sakon Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci, mafi muhimmancin abin da ke nuni da hanyar cimma wannan hadin kan shi ne wannan farkawa ta Musulunci.	<pad> The next issue is the emphasis on the issue of Muslim unity which is particularly in the message of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, the most important thing that indicates the way to achieve this unity is this awakening of Islam.</s>
102	These messages have tried to deepen and spread Islamic Awakening.	A cikin wannan sakon ana kokari wajen fadada farkawa ta Musulunci da kuma yada ta.	<pad> In this message, we try to spread the knowledge of Islam and spread it.</s>
103	Certain manifestations of this unity are also mentioned in these messages: for example, pilgrims wear identical clothes, follow the same path, chant the same slogans, adopt the same positions, make tawaf around the same center and other such things.	Ana kuma ishara da bayyana wannan hadin kan: a matsayin misali tufafi iri guda da ake sanyawa, tafarki da kuma take guda da ake rerawa da kuma matsaya guda da ake dauka da sauransu.	<pad> The unity is also symbolized and expressed: for example, the same dress, the same music and dance, the same attitude and behavior, etc.</s>
104	In last year's message, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution pointed out that Ka'bah represents monotheism and that it is the symbol of moving towards Muslim unity.	A cikin sakon wannan shekarar Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci ya yi ishara da cewa Dakin Ka’aba wata alama ce ta tauhidi sannan kuma alama da kuma umurni ne na kama hanyar hadin kai.	<pad> In his annual message, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution pointed out that the Kaaba is a symbol of oneness and a sign and a call for unity.</s>
105	These messages also explain the great facilities of the Islamic Ummah â€“ its material and spiritual facilities and its geographic and cultural capacities. These messages remind the Islamic Ummah of its great facilities, which are unfortunately being plundered by the enemies.	Haka nan kuma a cikin wadannan sakonni ana bayanin irin gagarumin karfin da al'ummar musulmi suke da shi, da suka hada da karfi na abin duniya da na ruhi da kasa da al'adu; wato suna tunatar da al'umma irin gagarumin karfin da suke da shi wanda abin bakin cikin makiya suna kokarin raunana shi.	<pad> Also in these messages is the great strength of the Muslim community, which includes material and spiritual and national and cultural; that is, it reminds the people of their great strength which the enemies are trying to weaken.</s>
106	Disclosing the plots of the arrogant powers is another theme in these messages.	Haka nan kuma daya daga cikin batutuwan da suke cikin wadannan sakonni shi ne 'tona asirin irin makircin da ma'abota girman kai na duniya suke yi.	"<pad> One of the main themes of these messages is also to ""expose the schemes of the world's arrogants.""</s>"
107	In all these messages, the Leader mentions the evil plots of the arrogant powers to annihilate the Islamic Ummah.	A cikin dukkanin wadannan sakonni an yi ishara da shaidanci da ma'abota girman kai na duniya suke yi wajen kawar da al'ummar musulmi da kuma dalilan irin danyen aikin da suke yi.	<pad> In all these statements, they refer to the shaitanism of the world's power-hungry people in trying to eliminate the Muslim community and the reasons for their crimes.</s>
108	The messages explain the crimes that are being committed as well as the most important issues and developments in Islamic territories, ranging from the distortion of Islamic truths to enmities, ethnocentric fitnas, spread of corruption, numerous killings and the propaganda against the Islamic Ummah.	Danyen aikin da suke aikatawa da kuma batutuwa masu muhimmanci da suke faruwa a kasashen musulmi; da suka hada da batutuwan da (makiyan) suka gurbata su da kuma kokarin da suke yi na haifar da fitina ta kabilanci da yada fasadi da kisan gilla da kuma bakar farfagandar da suke yi a kan al'ummar musulmi.	<pad> The evil work they are doing and important issues in Muslim countries; including the things they have spoiled and the efforts they are making to create sectarian divisions, propagate corruption, kill people and spread false propaganda about the Muslim community.</s>
109	All these threats â€“ which have increased after 9/11 â€“ have been mentioned by the Leader in his messages.	Dukkanin wadannan barazanar wadanda suka kunno kai bayan harin 11 ga watan Satumba, jagora yana bayani kansu.	<pad> All these other threats that have arose since the September 11th attacks, the leader is aware of.</s>
110	Because the plots of the enemies to occupy the world of Islam were foiled by the Revolution and Islamic Awakening, they started to divide the Islamic Ummah and spread corruption.	Don kuwa albarkacin juyin juya halin Musulunci da kuma farkawa ta Musulunci an sami damar dushe kaifin makircin ma'abota girman kan duniya na mamaye kasashen musulmi; don haka a halin yanzu makiya sun fara wani shiri na kekketa al'ummar musulmi da kuma yada fasadi.	<pad> Because thanks to the revolution and the awakening of Islam, the world's imperialists have been able to defeat the plan of conquering the Muslim countries; so now the enemies have begun a campaign to discredit the Muslim community and spread corruption.</s>
111	Therefore, in his messages the Leader of the Islamic Revolution says that the arrogant powers are an enemy of oppressed people and human rights, a supporter of terrorism and a promoter of hegemony and hypocrisy in the world of Islam. Of course disclosing the role of the mercenary regimes in the region is another important theme. These regimes try to fulfill the goals of colonialism and take away the essence of hajj: these things have also been mentioned in the messages.	A saboda haka a cikin sakonnin Jagoran akan bayyana girman kan duniya a matsayin makiyan raunanan mutane, masu take hakkokin bil'adama kana kuma masu goyon bayan ta'addanci da yada munafunci da mulkin mallaka a kasashen musulmi.

One of the most important points is to expose the role of the coalition governments of the region that are trying to ensure the imperialist agenda and to derail the Hajj from its original purpose.</s>
112	Introducing the Islamic Republic as a successful model â€“ which has stood up against the arrogant powers, implemented Islam in all aspects of life, pioneered Muslim unity, promoted solidarity between the leadership and the people and represented religious democracy and support for the oppressed â€“ is another theme in these messages. Normally, all the messages which are issued by the Leader mention one or more of these themes.	Batu na karshe shi ne 'gabatar da Jamhuriyar Musulunci a matsayin abin koyi da ya samu nasara wajen fada da ma'abota girman kai na duniya' sannan kuma abin koyi na aiwatar da Musulunci cikin dukkanin rayuwa da kuma kira zuwa ga hadin kai na Musulunci, abin koyi na hadin kai tsakanin jagora da al'umma, alama ta tsarin demokradiyya na addini da kuma nuna so da kauna da kuma taimakon raunana.	<pad> The last point is 'to welcome the Islamic Republic as a model of success in fight against world imperialism' and also a model of application of Islam in all aspects of life and calling for unity of Islam, a model of unity between leader and people, a symbol of religious democracy and showing love and affection and support for the weak.</s>
113	In what ways has stressing these themes affected other countries?	- Mene ne tasirin wadannan abubuwa a sauran kasashe na daban?	<pad> What is the effect of these things on other countries?</s>
114	Has it received any feedback from the prominent figures and politicians of Muslim and Arab countries?	Shin yana da wani matsayi a tsakanin masana da 'yan siyasa na kasashen musulmi ko kuma na larabawa?	<pad> Is there a position among the scientists and politicians of Muslim countries or Arab countries?</s>
115	Whenever we travel to other countries and take part in different conferences, everybody mentions these points and praises these messages. We travel to around 50 countries every year and we speak to different Muslim individuals, groups and leaders, particularly political leaders and activists of different Islamic countries.	A dukkanin tafiya da kuma taron kara wa juna sani da muka halarta – a kowace shekara dai mu kan kai ziyara zuwa kimanin kasashen hamsin – mu kan gana da mutane da kungiyoyi da shugabanni na Musulunci musamman shugabannin kungiyoyi na siyasa na kasashe daban-daban da 'yan gwagwarmaya – dukkanin su suna ishara da wannan batu da kuma fadin maganganu masu kyau danagne da wadannan sakonni.	<pad> In all our trips and seminars - we visit about fifty countries every year - we meet people, groups and Muslim leaders, especially the leaders of different political organizations and activists - all of them refer to this issue and speak positively about these messages.</s>
116	That is to say, in spite of our weaknesses in making these messages publicly available, they have had an invigorating effect wherever they have been published.	Wato duk da irin raunin da muke da shi wajen isar da wannan sakon, to amma a duk inda aka samu damar isar da wannan sakon, ya kan yi gagarumin tasiri.	<pad> However, despite our difficulty in delivering this message, wherever we can deliver it, it will have a great impact.</s>
117	Currently, public diplomacy is being discussed in the world. That is to say, leaders of countries are addressing the people rather than governments.	- A halin yanzu dai batun diplomasiyya na gaba daya ne yake gudana a duniya; wato a halin yanzu jagororin kasashe suna magana ne da al'umma.	<pad> Nowadays, there is a global diplomacy in the world; that is, nowadays leaders of countries are speaking to the people.</s>
118	Can we think of these hajj messages as one of the pillars of public diplomacy of the Islamic Republic and as a means to export the Revolution?	Shin ana iya daukan wannan sako na hajji a matsayin daya daga cikin rukunan irin wannan diplomasiyya na gaba daya na Jamhuriyar Musulunci sannan kuma wata hanya ta isar da juyin juya halin Musulunci?	<pad> Can we take this Hajj message as one of the pillars of this general diplomacy of the Islamic Republic and a way to convey the Islamic revolution?</s>
119	One of the beautiful ways of exporting the message of the Revolution is through the messages which have been issued by Imam Khomeini and the Leader.	Ko shakka babu; daya daga cikin hanyoyi masu kyau na isar da sakon juyi juya hali shi ne wannan sako na Imam da Jagora ga mahajjata.	<pad> No doubt; one of the best ways to convey the message of change is this message of the Imam and Leader to the pilgrims.</s>
120	Issuing these messages is one way of invigorating the hajj congregation, responding to the efforts to take away the essence of hajj and highlighting the role of hajj in the life of Muslims. And I believe these messages have had their effects although â€“ as I said â€“ we have not made enough efforts to make them available to everybody.	Daya daga cikin hanyoyin karfafa taron hajj da kuma mayar da martani ga kokarin da ake yi na kawar da irin matsayin da hajjin ya ke da shi da kuma irin rawar da ya ke takawa cikin rayuwar musulmi, shi ne da wadannan sakonni wanda a ra'ayina yana da tasirin gaske a tattare da shi. Duk kuwa da cewa kamar yadda na fadi muna da gazawa wajen isar da shi.	<pad> One of the ways to strengthen Hajj and respond to attempts to devalue Hajj's status and role in Muslim life is with these messages, which I think are very important, even though as I said we have a difficulty in delivering it.</s>
121	The problem is that many hajj pilgrims travel a long distance and take a lot of trouble, but they fail to understand the message of hajj.	Gazawar ita ce cewa da dama daga cikin alhazai suna zuwa daga wajaje masu nisa, suna shan wahala masu yawa to amma ba sa iya fahimtar sakon da ke cikin hajji.	<pad> The problem is that many pilgrims come from very far away places, suffer great difficulties but fail to understand the meaning of Hajj.</s>
122	According to Islamic narrations, â€œThe light of hajj does not dim on the pilgrims unless they sin.â€ That is to say, hajj pilgrims return with the light of hajj and this light shows itself both in their human nature and their activities in society until they commit a sin, which gradually destroys the light.	"Muna da wata riwaya da take cewa: ""Hasken aiki hajji zai ci gaba da kasancewa tare da alhaji matukar bai aikata zunubi ba', wato alhaji zai dawo ne da hasken da ke tattare da aikin hajji, sannan kuma wannan hasken zai ci gaba da zama tare da shi da kuma bayyana cikin ayyuka da al'ummarsa har zuwa lokacin da abin Allah ya kiyaye ya aikata zunubi, to a lokacin kan a hankali a hankali haske zai ci gaba da gushewa."	"<pad> We have a Hadith that says: ""The light of Hajj will continue to be with the pilgrim until he commits sin,"" meaning the pilgrim will return with the light of Hajj, and this light will continue to be with him and appear in his deeds and community until the pilgrim commits sin, then the light will gradually begin to dissipate.</s>"
123	I hope hajj pilgrims will make efforts to receive the light of hajj and to preserve the message of hajj so that hajj can have its effect on educating the Islamic Ummah.

130	For me, one of the enjoyable and pleasant meetings during my trips is the meetings that I arrange with our honorable scholars and luminaries - who are rendering services in different provinces across the country - and young seminarians who are like saplings and buds in the area of religious education.

136	He used to do so with his actions as well. His humility, his piety, his inattention to many of the superficial things in life - these were among his characteristics.

137	At the end of his relatively long life, Allah the Exalted bestowed martyrdom on him instead of a natural death.	Haka nan kuma Allah Madaukakin Sarki Ya ba shi lada; a karshen wata doguwar rayuwa, Allah ya arzurta shi da mutuwa ta shahada.	<pad> And Allah the Most High has rewarded him; at the end of a long life, Allah has blessed him with the death of shahada.</s>

146	May God bestow His mercy and blessings on him.	Allah ya yi masa rahama.	<pad> Allah makes him a blessing.</s>
147	After the Revolution and before my presidential terms, I met him in his home during one of my trips to Kermanshah and I had the opportunity to see his artistic works up close.

149	"I asked him to write a hadith on a piece of paper so that I could put it up on the wall: ""He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others.""

152	Dear people, dear brothers, my dear children, dear youth, dear male and female seminarians, if you want to imbue the atmosphere with our scent like a flower, if you want spirituality to freely flow out of you like a river to quench the thirst of those who are after spirituality, this is how you should do it: educate yourselves before educating others.	"Ya ku matasa! Ya ku dalibai maza da mata!

"<pad> You young people! You students! If we want to be like a beautiful flower that smells good, if you want to be like a spring water that people will drink without permission, then the way to achieve that is: ""He started teaching cancer.""</s>"
153	Those of His servants only who are possessed of knowledge fear Allah. [The Holy Quran, 35: 28] According to this holy ayah, which was recited at the beginning of this meeting, fear of God is a characteristic of learned people.	"Wannan aya mai girma da aka karanto da ke cewa: ""Malami kawai ke tsoron Allah daga cikin bayinSa"" (Suratu Fatir 35:28). Tsoron Allah daya ne daga cikin siffofin da malamai suka kebanta da su."	"<pad> The great verse that was read is: ""Only the imams fear God among His servants"" (Suratu Fatir 35:28). To fear God is one of the distinctive qualities of imams.</s>"
154	Well, learned people and ulama have many characteristics, but this holy ayah only refers to fear of God.	Na'am malamai suna da wasu siffofin, to amma sai aka zabi tsoron Allah.	<pad> No, they have other qualities, but they were killed for fear of God.</s>
155	The characteristic of knowledge is that it strikes fear of God - this great blessing - into the hearts of those who possess it.	Siffar ilimi ita ce cewa mutum ya kan sami wannan babbar ni'ima, wato sanya tsoron Allah cikin zuciyar mutum.	<pad> The characteristic of knowledge is that one can obtain this great blessing, that is, to put fear of God in the heart of one.</s>
156	Compared with people of my age, it is easier for you dear youth to develop fear of God in your hearts. When you reach my age, things will become difficult for you unless you take care of them during your youth.	A saboda wajibi ne a samo wannan siffar. Ku din nan matasa cikin sauki sama da ni za ku iya yin wannan aikin. A lokacin da kuka kai ga shekarun mu, idan har wani mutum ya yi wani abu a lokacin samartakansa, to hakan zai amfane shi; idan kuwa ba haka to lamarin zai zamanto masa da wahala.	<pad> For that reason, it is necessary to find this form. You younger people can do this job easier than I can. When you reach our age, if a person has done something in his youth, it will benefit him; if not, it will be difficult for him.</s>
157	The difference is that some people reach old age and some others do not.	Wannan rayuwar dai wacce za ta kare; wasu za su kai ga tsufa, wasu kuma ba za su kai ga hakan ba.	<pad> This life is going to end; some will get older, some will not.</s>
158	You should know that the difference between 20, 30 or 70 years of age is not that great. Time passes like a flash.	Lalle ya kamata ku san cewa; tazarar da ke tsakanin shekaru ashirin da shekaru talatin har zuwa shekaru saba'in har zuwa sama da saba'in, wato irin shekarun da muke da shi, tazara ce karama; tamkar wutan lantarki haka za ta wuce.	<pad> You should know that the gap between 20 and 30 years and 70 and above is very small; it will pass like a lightning bolt.</s>
159	When people are twenty years old, they think that they have a long time before they reach the age of seventy.	A lokacin da mutum ya ke shekaru ashirin-talatin yana zaton cewa ai akwai lokaci kafin kai wa ga shekaru saba'in.	<pad> When a person is thirty-five, he thinks there's time before he reaches the age of seventy.</s>
160	No, time passes like a flash and soon it will be time to leave this world. If you want to do something with this short life, you should prepare the way while you are young.	Ina, cikin gaggawa za su wuce; daga nan kuma sai maganar tafiya. Idan har cikin dan wannan karamin lokaci an tsara mutum zai sami damar aikata wani abu, ya sami damar rike wani guzuri, to wajibi ne tun lokacin samartakansa ya samar da hakan.	<pad> Yes, they will pass quickly; then it's time to leave. If in this short period of time a person is supposed to do something, to hold a treasure, then he must already from his birth provide for that.</s>
161	I believe fear of God, divine remembrance, piety and closeness to God are more urgent and more advisable for seminarians than acquiring knowledge.	A saboda haka ina kiran dalibai masu girma zuwa ga kankan da kai da ambaton Allah da tsoron Allah da kuma kokari wajen samun kusaci da Allah wanda ya ke a matsayin wajibi sama da kira zuwa ga ilimi, wanda tushe na asali na aikin su shi ne neman ilimi.	<pad> For that reason, I call on the noble students to be careful with the mention of Allah and fear of Allah and to strive to get closer to Allah which is a duty above the call for knowledge, whose original basis of their work is to seek knowledge.</s>
162	Knowledge that is not accompanied by piety is useless and sometimes harmful.	Idan har ya zamana an sami ilimi amma ba tare da tsoron Allah ba, to wannan ilimi yana iya zama mara amfani, a wani lokacin ma mai cutarwa.	<pad> If knowledge is gained but without fear of God, then this knowledge may be useless, and in some cases even harmful.</s>
163	We had certain learned people - both religious and non-religious scholars - who not only failed to make use of their knowledge to benefit themselves and others, but their knowledge also became a burden and a problem.	Muna da wani malami - wanda yake da ilimi na addini da wanda ba na addini ba - wanda ba wai kawai bai amfana da ilimin ba ne, face ma dai ya zamanto bala'i a gare shi.	<pad> We have a teacher - both religious and non-religious - who not only didn't benefit from the knowledge, but it became a curse to him.</s>
164	This spirituality is like a soul for knowledge and those who possess it.	Lalle wannan ruhi na ababe masu kusata mutum da Ubangiji abubuwa ne da suka zama wajibi ga ilimi da malami.	<pad> This spirit of things that bring the man closer to God is a duty of knowledge and scholar.</s>
165	The city of Kermanshah is an important city.	To garin Kermanshah gari ne mai muhimmanci.	<pad> Kermanshah is a city of great significance.</s>
166	As was pointed out by Mr. Olama, Kermanshah used to have great learned scholars in the distant past. And over the past 200, 250 years, there were great scholarly families in this city - such as the Al-e Agha family, the Jalili family and other scholarly families in which there were not just one, two or ten learned people: there were more of them.	Kamar yadda Malam Ulama ya fadi a wani lokaci mai tsawo a baya, Kermanshah ya kasance yana da manyan malamai; irin su iyalan Al Agha, irin su iyalan Jalili, da sauran gidajen ilimi da ake samun manyan malamai a cikinsu, ba wai mutum guda ko mutane biyu ko mutanen goma ba - sama da haka - gidan ilimi ne.	<pad> As the Imam said a long time ago, Kermanshah had many great imams; such as the Al Agha family, the Jalili family, and other schools that have many great imams, not just one or two or ten - more than that - a school is a school of scholars.</s>
167	In this regard, another point about Kermanshah that attracts my attention is that the people of Kermanshah are hospitable and generous to everybody who visits their city and it appears that they are even more hospitable and generous to religious scholars who visit their city.	Wani lamarin na daban a wannan babin wanda kuma mai jan hankali dangane da Kermanshah shi ne cewa kamar yadda mutanen Kermanshah mutane ne masu so da kuma girmama baki sannan kuma masu nuna rahama ga mutanen da suka zo, to lalle malamai ma suna da wannan siffar, a wani lokaci ma sama da hakan.	<pad> Another thing that is interesting about Kermanshah is that just as the people of Kermanshah are kind and generous and showing mercy to the visitors, so are the teachers, sometimes even more so.</s>
168	The late Agha Mohammad Ali - who was the son of the late Vahid Behbahani and one of his best students - decided to come to Kermanshah and stay.	Marigayi Muhammad Ali (yardar Allah ta tabbata a gare shi) - dan marigayi Wahid Bahbahani wanda ya kasance daga cikin manyan daliban babansa - ya tashi ya zo Kermanshah ya ci gaba da rayuwa.	<pad> Muhammad Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) - son of the late Wahid Bahbahani who was one of his great students - moved to Kermanshah to continue his life.</s>
169	Although he did not have such an intention, Kermanshah convinced him to stay and he started the Al-e Agha family in Kermanshah.	Duk kuwa da cewa ba shi da nufin zama, amma kuma ya ci gaba da zaman, sun rike shi, daga nan ya zamanto daga cikin Iyalan Al Agha.	<pad> Although he did not intend to stay, he stayed, and they took him in, and he became one of the family of Al Agha.</s>
170	He and many of his children and descendents are considered among the learned religious scholars of Kermanshah.	Shi din nan da wasu daga cikin ‘ya'yansa mai yawa sun kasance daga cikin malamai.	<pad> She and many of her sons were teachers.</s>
171	This is one example.	Wannan wani misali ne guda.	<pad> This is just one example.</s>
172	Another example is the late Aseyyed Hossein Haeri, who had travelled to Mashhad towards the end of his life.	Wani misalin kuma shi ne marigayi Agha Sayyid Husain Ha'iri, wanda a karshen rayuwarsa ya zo Mashahad.	<pad> Another example is the late Agha Sayyid Husain Ha'iri, who ended his life in Mashahad.</s>
173	I remember certain things about him.	Har ya zuwa yanzu dai ina iya tuna wasu abubuwa dangane da shi.	<pad> I can still remember some things about him.</s>
174	He was the son of Aseyyed Mohammad Esfahani's brother, and a student of Aseyyed Mohammad Esfahani and a great cleric from Iraq who stayed in Kermanshah for many years.	Shi din nan dan dan'uwan marigayi Agha Sayyid Muhammad Isfahani sannan kuma dalibin Agha Sayyid Muhammad Isfahani sannan kuma dalibin Akhund da Mulla Bozorgi wanda ya zo daga Iraki sannan kuma shekara da shekaru ya zauna a Kermanshah.	<pad> He is the younger brother of late Agha Sayyid Muhammad Isfahani and a pupil of Agha Sayyid Muhammad Isfahani and Akhund and Mulla Bozorgi who came from Iraq and lived in Kermanshah for years.</s>
175	He used to carry out religious rulings in Isfahan.	Ya kasance yana zartar da haddi a Isfahan.	<pad> He was a haddi in Isfahan.</s>
176	He was both a religious scholar and a spiritual figure.	Shi din nan ya kasance ma'abocin sanin Allah da kuma lissafi.	<pad> He was a master of theology and mathematics.</s>
177	In terms of his knowledge, he was a student of the late Fathali Soltanabadi who used to live in Samara at that time.

178	Another figure that I would like to mention is the late Sardar-e Kaboli, an outstanding scholar in different areas.	Wani malamin kuma shi ne marigayi Sardar Kabuli, sanannen masanin bangarori daban-daban.	<pad> Another teacher was late Sardar Kabuli, a well-known scientist of different fields.</s>
179	The book that has been written about him is a very good book. I read the book several years ago.

181	I read in the book that the late Hajj Agha Hossein Qomi visits Kermanshah on a pilgrimage and meets with the late Sardar-e Kaboli. They debate about Kiblah or a similar issue and the late Sardar-e Kaboli speak about certain scholarly matters.	Na karanta a cikin wannan littafin cewa marigayi Hajj Agha Husain Kummi (yardar Allah ta tabbata a gare shi) a tafiyar da ya yi zuwa wajaje masu tsarki ko kuma a hanyar dawowarsa, ya zo Kermanshah don ganawa da marigayi Sardar Kabuli.	<pad> I read in this book that Hajj Agha Husain Kummi (may Allah be pleased with him) on his trip to the holy sites or on his way back, came to Kermanshah to meet with the late Sardar Kabuli.</s>
182	The writer of the book says that he saw with his own eyes - I thinks he says he saw with his own eyes, but I am not sure because I read the book several years ago - that Hajj Agha Hossein Qomi would sit down with Sardar-e Kaboli to learn those scholarly matters from him while he was a marja taqlid and an outstanding scholar.	Marubucin littafi yana cewa ni kai na na shaidu zama biyu - ina zaton ya ce ni da kaina; don kuwa shekara da shekaru kenan da karanta littafin - wato hajj Agha Husain Kummi, wanda ya kasance marja'i sannan kuma babban malami amma yana zama a gaban Sardar Kabuli shi kuma yana karantar da shi wannan bahasi na ilimi.	<pad> The author of the book says I was a witness to two things - I think he meant me; for I have read the book for years and years - that is Hajj Agha Husain Kummi, who was a marja'i and a great teacher, but he sat in front of Sardar Kabuli and taught him this scholarly discussion.</s>
183	And this is a lesson for us: the late Hajj Agha Hossein Qomi decided to learn something new at the age of eighty while he was a marja taqlid.	Shi kansa wannan darasi ne; wato koyo a lokacin mutum yana dan sheakru saba'in (kamar yadda marigayi Hajj Agha Husain ya yi) sannan kuma a matsayi na marja'i.	<pad> It is the very same lesson; learning at the age of seventeen (as Hajj Agha Husain did) and as a marja'i.</s>
184	For a learned scholar, not only is this not a disgrace or a flaw, but it is a source of honor.	Hakan ya zamanto ba wai abin kyama ko kuma aibi ba a wajen wani babban malami face ma dai abin alfahari.	<pad> That was not a sin or a disgrace for a senior teacher but rather a pride.</s>
185	We seminarians should learn from them. You dear youth should move forward on the basis of such principles.	Wajibi ne mu dalibi mu koyi irin wadannan abubuwa.

333	The 15th of Khordad was not the beginning of the great movement by the people and the clergy.	Ranar 15 ga watan Khordad ba ita ce mafarin gagarumin yunkurin malamai da mutane ba.	<pad> 15th of Khordad was not the beginning of the great effort of scholars and people.</s>
334	Before the 15th of Khordad, important events had taken place in the year 1341 as well as at the beginning of the year 1342.	Kafin ranar 15 ga watan Khordad, akwai wasu batutuwa masu muhimmanci da suka faru a shekarar 1341 da kuma farko-farkon shekarar 1342.	<pad> Before 15th of Khordad, there were some important events in 1341 and early 1342.</s>
335	For example, the event in Feiziyeh School took place on the 2nd of Farvardin in 1342: it resulted in the injury of seminarians and the insult to the great marja taqlid, the late Ayatollah Golpaygani.	Ga misali, abin da ya faru a makarantar Faiziyya ya faru ne a ranar 2 ga watan Farbardeen shekarar 1342, lamarin da ya kai ga bugu da kuma raunana daliban addini bugu da kari kan cin mutumcin babban marja'i marigayi Ayatullah Golpaygani.	<pad> For example, the Faiziyya incident occurred on 2 February 1342, which led to the beating and discomfort of religious students as well as insulting the late Ayatullah Golpaygani, the great leader.</s>
336	Before that event, towards the end of the year 1341, there were demonstrations in Tehran's bazaar and the great marja taqlid, the late Ayatollah Hajj Sayyid Ahmad Khansari, was insulted.	Kafin nan, a karshe-karshen shekarar 1341, lamarin zanga-zangar mutane a kasuwar Tehran ya kunno kai, a nan ma an ci mutumcin babban marja'i marigayi Ayatullah Hajj Sayyid Ahmad Khunsari.	<pad> Afterwards, in the end of 1341, a large crowd of people took part in the Tehran market protests, where the late Ayatullah Hajj Sayyid Ahmad Khunsari was honored as the great leader.</s>
337	These things show that the movement by the clergy had reached such levels in 1341 and early 1342 that security forces of the oppressive regime had started to treat seminarians, religious scholars and even marja taqlids in a brutal way.	Dukkanin wadannan abubuwa ne da suke nuni da cewa yunkurin malamai a shekarar 1341 da kuma farko-farkon 1342 ya kai wani matsayi na girma ta yadda ‘yan sanda da jami'an tsaron gwamnatin zalunci na lokacin ta yi amfani da karfi sosai a kan malamai da dalibai kai hatta ma maraja'ai ba su tsira ba.	<pad> All these things show that the teacher's movement in 1341 and early 1342 was so large that the police and security guards of the then-cruel government used force against the teachers and students, even the imams were not spared.</s>
338	However, the 15th of Khordad of 1342 was a very important juncture.	To amma duk da hakan, ranar 15 ga watan Khordad wani lokaci ne mai matukar muhimmanci.	<pad> But however, the 15th of Khordad is a very important date.</s>
339	The reason is that the event which took place on the 15th of Khordad revealed that the bond between the people and the clergy had reached a so-called dangerous level.	Dalilin hakan kuwa shi ne cewa abin da ya faru a ranar 15 ga watan Khordad 1342, lamari ne da ke nuni da alakar da ke tsakanin mutane da malamai a wancan lokacin mai hatsarin gaske.	<pad> The reason for this is that what happened on 15th of Khordad 1342, shows the dangers of the relationship between people and scholars in that time.</s>
340	In that year, on the anniversary of Ashura - which fell on the 13th of Khordad - our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) delivered a historic speech in Feiziyeh School.	A ranar Ashurar wancan shekarar - wadda ta kasance ranar 13 ga watan Khordad ce - mai girma Imam ya gabatar da wani jawabi mai matukar muhimmanci a makarantar Faiziyya.	<pad> On Ashura that year - which was 13th of Khordad - the great Imam gave a very important lecture at the school of Fiqhiyya.</s>
341	Later on when they had arrested Imam (r.a.), on the 15th of Khordad there was a great movement in Tehran as well as in Qom and other cities and the taghuti regime decided to do everything in its power to suppress the movement by relying on its army, police and security organizations.	Daga baya jami'an tsaro suka kama Imam, a ranar 15 ga watan Khordad, a Tehran haka nan kuma a Kum da wasu garuruwan na daban, mutane sun fito zanga-zanga. Gwamnatin Dagutu ta wancan lokacin kuwa ta fito da dukkan karfinta, da sojoji da ‘yan sanda da sauran jami'an tsaron fararen kaya, ta yi diran mikiya a kan mutane. A ranar 15 ga watan Khordad an sami wani yunkuri na mutane.	<pad> The security forces later arrested the Imam, on 15th of Khordad, in Tehran and Kum and other cities, people went out to protest. The government of the day used all its forces, with soldiers, police and other civil security personnel, to crack down on the people. On 15th of Khordad there was a movement of people.</s>
342	The point is that it was this bond that ensured the spread and victory of the movement.	Abin luran a nan shi ne cewa irin wannan alakar ita ce lamunin ci gaban wannan yunkurin da kuma kai shi zuwa ga nasara.	<pad> The important thing is that this relationship is the one that allows the progression of this effort and leads it to success.</s>
343	Wherever a movement is supported by the people, that movement will prevail.	A duk inda aka sami wani yunkuri da yake da goyon bayan mutane da kuma tafiya tare da su, to kuwa wannan yunkurin zai ci gaba.	<pad> Whenever there is an initiative that has the support and goes with people, then that initiative will continue.</s>
344	But if the people do not develop a bond with a protest movement, that movement will fail.	Amma idan har mutane ba su shigo cikin wani yunkuri na nuna rashin amincewa ba, to kuwa ba zai yi nasara ba.	<pad> But if people don't participate in a movement to show discontent, it won't succeed.</s>
345	For example, after the Constitutional Movement in Iran, there were certain events and certain activities by both leftist and nationalist groups, but all of them were destined to fail because they did not have the support of the people.	Kamar yadda ya faru a Iran lokacin yunkurin kundin tsarin mulki. ‘Yan gurguzu da masu kishin kasa sun yunkura to amma yunkurin na su ya sha kashi. Saboda mutane ba su tare da su.	<pad> Like what happened in Iran during the constitution effort. The revolutionaries and patriots tried but their attempts failed. Because the people were not with them.</s>
346	When the people step into the arena and support a movement with their hearts and minds and with their presence, it becomes possible for that movement to prevail and achieve victory.	A lokacin da mutane suka shigo fage sannan kuma suka goyi bayan wani yunkurin, sannan dukkanin tunani da karfin mutane ya zamanto tare da shi, to kuwa wannan yunkurin zai ci gaba da wanzuwa da kuma samun nasara.	<pad> When people come into the field and support an effort, and all the people's minds and energy is with it, then that effort will continue to exist and succeed.</s>
347	The event that took place on the 15th of Khordad proved this point.	Hakan kuwa shi ne abin da ya faru a ranar 15 ga watan Khordad.	<pad> That's what happened on 15th of Khordad.</s>
348	The arrest of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) resulted in such an uprising in Tehran and certain other parts of the country that the regime had to step in to suppress the people in a brutal way. A large number of people were killed.	Sakamakon irin mutanen da suka fito a garin Tehran da sauran garuruwa daga jin labarin an kama Imam, lamarin da ya tilasta wa gwamnati shigowa da dukkan karfinta da diran mikiya a kan mutane; ta yadda aka kashe wani adadi mai yawa na mutane.	<pad> Because of the large number of people who came out of Tehran and other cities after hearing the news that the Imam was captured, the government had to use all its force and fire on the people; so that a large number of people were killed.</s>
349	The streets of Tehran were covered with the blood of pious people and youth.	Titunan Tehran suka cika da jinin bayin Allah mumimai da matasa masu kishi.	<pad> The streets of Tehran are full of the blood of the sons of God, mothers and young men who are angry.</s>
350	On the 15th of Khordad, the brutal and ruthless nature of the taghuti regime was fully revealed.	A ranar 15 ga watan Khordad dan mulkin kama-karya da kuma irin zuciya maras imani ta dagutu ta bayyana a fili.	<pad> On 15th of June Khordad the tyranny and apathy of the regime were exposed.</s>
351	Another point regarding the event which happened on the 15th of Khordad - a point to which our youth and dear people should pay attention - is that no international community and none of the so-called human rights organizations protested against the brutal killings in Tehran and other parts of the country.	Wani batun kuma da ke cikin wannan lamari na 15 ga watan Khordad - wanda yana da kyau matasanmu da mutanenmu masu girma su lura da shi - shi ne cewa a yayin wannan kisan kiyashin da aka yi wa mutane a Tehran da sauran garuruwa, babu wata cibiya ta kasa da kasa, wadanda suke kiran kansu cibiyoyin kare hakkokin bil'adama, da ya ce wani abu; babu wani da ya nuna rashin amincewarsa.	<pad> One more thing about the 15th of Khordad incident - something that is good for our young people and our elderly people to notice - is that during this massacre in Tehran and other cities, no international organization, those who call themselves human rights organizations, said anything; no one expressed his disagreement.</s>
352	The people and the clergy remained in the arena.	Mutane da malamai sun kasance su kadai ne kawai a fagen.	<pad> People and teachers were not the only ones in this field.</s>
353	They said that it was a feudalist movement. The nationalists - who were claiming to support anti-government activities - also condemned the movement.

354	Wherever lazy people fail to take risks and play a role in the arena, they accuse pious combatants of extremism. They said that the movement was an extremist movement.	A duk lokacin da masu neman sauki da jin dadi suka gagara sama wa kansu waje a cikin gwagwarmayar da ake yi, nan take za su zargi muminan mutane masu gwagwarmaya da tsaurin ra'ayi da wuce gona da iri.	<pad> Whenever the easygoing and comfortable fail to get their share of the struggle, they will immediately accuse the brave activists of being a nationalist and excessively egoistic.</s>
355	They rejected it as a radical movement. Imam (r.a.) remained in the arena, relying on the support of the people, and he managed to present the image of a truly decisive and determined spiritual leader to all people and to all history.	Suna fadin cewa, wadannan masu tsaurin ra'ayi ne, yunkurin wani yunkuri ne na wuce gona da iri.

The Imam, because of the support of the people, continued his movement, and confirmed to the world and history his status as a spiritual leader and a determined accomplice of his goal.</s>
356	Our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) had three beliefs which made him decisive, courageous and steadfast: namely, faith in God, faith in the people and faith in himself. These three beliefs revealed themselves in the character, decisions and actions of Imam (r.a.) in the true sense of the word.	Imam dai ya kasance yana da wasu abubuwa guda uku da ya yi imani da su, wadanda su ne suka ba shi azama, jaruntaka da kuma tsayin daka.

These three beliefs were: belief in God, belief in human power, and belief in yourself. These three beliefs manifested themselves in the presence and the position that the Imam took.</s>
357	Imam (r.a.) spoke to the people through his heart and the people accepted his call with their heart and soul.	Imam yana magana ne daga tsakiyar zuciyarsa, sannan su kuma mutane suka amsa masa wannan kira nasa da dukkanin abin da suka mallaka.	<pad> The imam was speaking from the heart, and the people answered his call with all that they had.</s>

362	"Regarding faith in God, Imam (r.a.) was the manifestation of this holy ayah: ""Those to whom the people said: Surely men have gathered against you, therefore fear them, but this increased their faith, and they said: Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector."""	"Dangane da imani da Allah, Imam ya kasance alama ta ayar nan da take cewa: ""Wadanda mutane suka ce musu: ‘Lalle ne, mutane sun taru (rundunoni) saboda ku, don haka ku ji tsoronsu."

363	"[The Holy Quran, 3: 173] Imam (r.a.) was firmly committed to ""Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is the Protector"" with all his heart and soul."	"Sai wannan maganar ta kara musu imani, kuma suka ce: Allah ne Mai isar mana kuma madalla da wannan Wakilin"" (suratu Al Imrana 3:173)."	"<pad> Then they added to their belief, and said: ""Allah is our sufficient, and He is above this messenger.""</s>"
364	"He acted, worked and spoke for the sake of God and he knew that ""if you help (the cause of) Allah, He will help you"" [The Holy Quran, 47: 7] is a divine promise and that it is definite and inviolable."	"Ya yunkura ne saboda Allah, ya yi magana da kuma aiki a kas yana da yakinin cewa: ""Idan kun taimaki Allah, zai taimake ku"" (Suratu Muhammad 47:7), wannan dai alkawari ne na Ubangiji, wanda tabbas ne zai cika shi, babu wani kokwanto cikin hakan."	"<pad> He tried for Allah, he said and he did, believing that: ""If you help Allah, He will help you"" (Surat Muhammad 47:7), this is the promise of the Lord, which He will surely fulfill, there is no doubt in it.</s>"
365	Regarding faith in the people, our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) knew the Iranian nation in the true sense of the word.	Dangane da imani da mutane, mai girma Imam (r.a) ya fahimci al'ummar Iran da dukkanin ma'anar wannan kalmar.	<pad> In terms of belief in people, the great Imam (r.a) understood the people of Iran with all the meanings of this word.</s>
366	Imam (r.a.) believed that our nation enjoys deep religious faith and is intelligent and courageous, a nation that has the capacity to shine like the sun in different areas only if it has competent leaders.	Imam ya yi amanna da cewa wannan al'ummar, al'umma ce ma'abociyar imani, mai hankali da kuma jaruntaka; wacce matukar ta sami wani jagora wanda ya dace, to kuwa za ta iya bayyanar da kanta a dukkanin fagage tamkar hasken rana.	<pad> The Imam believed that this people was a people of faith, reason and courage; who, if they had a right leader, could show themselves in all fields like the sun's light.</s>
367	One time an incompetent person like Shah Sultan Hussein caused the Iranian nation to retreat into a corner, but another time a courageous person like Nader Gholi - without those honorary titles - emerged among the people and became their leader by relying on his courage and as a result, our nation managed to expand the arena of its glory from Delhi to the Black Sea.	Imam ya yi amanna da hakan.

While some unfit people like Shah Sultan Husain humiliated the people of Iran, some brave people like Nadeer Kali - without these titles - appeared among the people and led the people with all their courage, so that our nation could show itself from Delhi to the Black Sea.</s>
368	He had faith in the Iranian nation.	Ya fahimci al'ummar Iran, sannan kuma ya yi amanna da su.	<pad> He understood the people of Iran and believed in them.</s>
369	He provoked the people's religious pride and the Iranian nation became the role model of resistance and insight.	Ya bayyanar da kishin addini da suke da shi ta yadda al'ummar Iran sun zamanto wani abin koyi na tsayin daka da kuma basira.	<pad> He revealed their religious animosity so that the people of Iran have become a model for determination and wisdom.</s>
370	In the eyes of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.), the people were the dearest and enemies of the people were the most hated.	Mutane dai sun kasance mafiya soyuwa a wajen Imam, sannan makiyan al'umma kuma a matsayin mafi girman abin kyama.	<pad> People were the most beloved of the Imam, and the enemies of the people were the greatest of his hatreds.</s>
371	The fact that Imam (r.a.) did not stop his battle against the domineering powers even for one single moment, was mainly because the domineering powers were enemies of the people's happiness, and Imam (r.a.) believed that enemies of the people were his enemies too.	Wannan shi ne dalilin da ya sanya kuke ganin Imam bai taba nuna gazawa ba a fagen fada da ‘yan mulkin mallaka masu takama da karfi saboda ‘yan mulkin mallaka sun zamanto masu adawa da jin dadin al'umma, sannan kuma Imam yana ganin masu kiyayya da mutane a matsayin abokan gaba.	<pad> This is why you see the Imam never showing failure in his fight against the powerful and arrogant colonisers because colonisers became anti-people, and the Imam saw people-haters as enemies.</s>
372	As for self-confidence, Imam (r.a.) taught the people of Iran to be confident.	Dangane da batun yarda da kai kuma, Imam ya koyar da al'ummar Iran cewa ‘lalle za mu iya'.	"<pad> In the matter of faith, the Imam taught the people of Iran that ""we can do it.""</s>"
373	Before instilling a sense of confidence into the people of Iran, Imam (r.a.) first revived this sense of self-confidence in himself. He exhibited his faith in his capabilities in the true sense of the word. On the anniversary of Ashura in the year 1342, while he was alone, Imam (r.a.) threatened the Shah that he would ask the people of Iran to force him out of the country if he continued acting like that.	Ya bayyanar wa duniya irin karfin da yake da shi.

On Ashura 1342, despite the pressure, the Imam appeared in front of students and people of Kum at the school of Fiqhiyya, threatening the King Muhammad Ridha Shah, who relied on America and other imperialists, and was acting without any limit or condition, that if you continue doing what you are doing, I will tell the people to expel you from Iran.</s>
374	This threat was made by a cleric in Qom who had no weapons, no equipment, no money and no international support.	Wani malami ne mazaunin garin Kum, wanda ba shi da wani makami, ko kudi ko kuma goyon baya da taimako na kasa da kasa ba.	<pad> A teacher from Kum, who does not have any weapons, money or international support and assistance.</s>
375	He managed to resist in this arena by relying on his faith in God and in himself.	Imani da Allah da kuma yarda da kai ne zai tabbatar da mutum a wannan fagen.	<pad> Imani with Allah and trust in yourself will sustain a person in this field.</s>
376	The day when Imam (r.a.) returned from exile, he threatened the government of Bakhtiar at Behesht Zahra Cemetery and he announced in a resonating voice that he would punch Bakhtiar's government in the mouth and that he would establish another government.	Haka nan a wancan lokacin da Imam ya dawo daga gudun hijira, a wannan makabarta ta Beheshti Zahra, Imam ya yi wa gwamnatin Bakhtiyar barazana da fadi a fili cewa: zan bugi bakin gwamnatin Bakktiyar, ni ne zan ayyana gwamnati.

This is your responsibility.</s>
377	Imam (r.a.) had faith in himself and in his capabilities.	Imam ya yi amanna da kansa da irin karfin da ya ke da shi.	<pad> Imam believed in cancer with all his strength.</s>
378	It was this self-confidence that was transferred to the people of Iran through his words and actions.	Irin wannan yarda da Allah din kuwa da Imam yake da shi, shi ne ya mika shi zuwa ga mutane.	<pad> This Imam's confidence in God, he has transmitted it to the people.</s>
379	And we had started to believe these things. Instilling a sense of inability - with the purpose of making nations lose faith in their capabilities - is one of the effective ways in which domineering powers spread their domination over different nations.	Kuma wasu sun yarda da hakan. Daya daga cikin makami mai tasiri da makiya suka rika wajen tabbatar da ikonsu a kan sauran al'ummomi, shi ne sanya musu jin cewa ‘ba za su iya ba', don mutane su yanke kauna, su dinga fadin cewa babu wani abin da za mu iya yi.	"<pad> And some of them agreed. One of the most effective weapons used by enemies to maintain their control over other nations is to make them feel ""unable"" to get people to give up hope, to say that there is nothing we can do.</s>"
380	In this way, they managed to keep the Iranian nation backwards in politics, science and economic activities as well as in all other arenas of life.	Da hakan ne suka ciyar da al'ummar Iran baya na tsawon shekaru dari a fagagen siyasa, ilimi, tattalin arziki da sauran fagage na rayuwa.	<pad> That's how they kept Iran's people behind for a century in politics, education, economics and other areas of life.</s>
381	"He told the Iranian nation, ""You can."""	Ya gaya wa al'ummar Iran cewa ‘Lalle za ku iya'.	"<pad> He told the people of Iran that ""We can do it.""</s>"

384	These three beliefs of Imam (r.a.) - namely faith in God, faith in the people and faith in himself - became the axis of all his decisions, actions and policies.

387	It was these three beliefs that gave Imam (r.a.) the power to enter Tehran in those conditions.	Wadannan abubuwa guda uku su ne suka ba wa Imam karfin gwiwan dawowa Tehran a irin wancan yanayin da ake ciki.	<pad> These three things were the reasons that gave the Imam the courage to return to Tehran in this situation.</s>
388	"These three beliefs were exhibited in the events that happened during Bahman of 1357, in the fitnas that happened in the country, in the establishment of the Islamic Republic, in his open resistance against the oppressive global order, in the slogan of ""neither the East, nor the West"", in the imposed war and in all the events that took place in those eventful ten years of Imam's life."

575	The reason why I want to discuss the developments of the year 1390 - and particularly the achievements that were made by the Iranian nation last year - is that our enemies and ill-wishers are making threats against our dear nation.	Dalilin da ya sanya mu ke magana kan batutuwan da suka faru a shekarar 1390 (da ta gabata) musamman irin nasarorin da al'ummar Iran suka samu a wannan shekarar shi ne saboda irin makirce-makircen da makiya da masu bakar aniya suka ta kulla wa al'ummar Iran ne.	<pad> The reason we are talking about the events of 1390 (last year) and the successes of the Iranian people is because of the conspiracies and plots that the enemies and the wicked have been planning against the Iranian people.</s>
576	The leaders of the arrogant powers, those who have power and wealth and their followers in our region are doing everything in their power - their financial, propaganda and political power - to intimidate the Iranian people and to disappoint them.	Shugabannin girman kai da masu tinkaho da kuma amfani da karfi da tursasawa da kuma 'yan amshin shatansu na wannan yanki na mu - sun yi amfani da dukkanin karfinsu, shin karfi ne na kudi, ko karfi na farfaganda da kuma na siyasa - wajen ganin sun razana al'ummar Iran da kuma sanya su yanke kauna.	<pad> The arrogants and the power-hungry leaders and their henchmen in our region have used all their power, whether it be money, propaganda or political, to make the people of Iran resentful and discouraged.</s>
577	Anybody who has followed the political propaganda of the ill-wishers of the Iranian nation realizes that all the activities, all the economic and political efforts and all the security and military threats are aimed at stopping, disappointing and intimidating the vibrant, living, dynamic, determined and capable Iranian nation, a nation that is standing firm in the middle of the arena in a totally courageous way, a nation that is moving forward.	Duk wanda ya ke bi irin farfagandar da masu bakar aniya kan al'ummar Iran suke yi, a fili zai iya ganin irin wadannan kokari na aiki, kokari na tattalin arziki da kokari na siyasa, barazana ta soji da dai sauransu da suka yi wajen ganin sun dunkufar da tsayayyiyar al'ummar Iran daga fagen ci gaba da gudanar da ayyukanta da kuma samun ci gaba, su sanya ta yanke kauna da kuma razana ta daga irin wannan kasantuwa da take da ita a fage.	<pad> Whoever follows the propaganda of the wicked people of Iran can clearly see all these efforts, both work and economic and political, military and other threats that they have made to try to keep the stable Iranian people from carrying out their activities and progress, to make them lose their hope and desire from their existence in this field.</s>
578	"In fact, aside from the slogan of ""we can"" which our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) taught us, the Revolution also gave us the courage to say, ""We can"". They want to convince us that we are incapable."	A hakikanin gaskiya suna son su fitar da wannan akida ta cewa 'lalle za mu iya' wanda mai girma Imam (Khumaini) ne ya koya mana ita sannan kuma juyin juya halin Musulunci ya ba mu karfin gwuiwan cewa lalle 'za mu iya' din daga zuciyar al'umma da cusa musu cewa lalle ku din nan ba za ku iya wani abu ba.	<pad> In fact, they want to remove the 'we can' attitude that the great Imam (Khomeini) has taught us and the revolution of Islam has strengthened it from the heart of the people and instill in them that you are not capable of anything.</s>
579	They are doing everything in their power to achieve this goal and their activities reached full swing in the year 1390.	Sun yi dukkanin kokarinsu wajen ganin sun cimma wannan manufar. Shekarar da ta gabatar ta kasance shekarar da suka kara kaimi ainun wajen cimma hakan.	<pad> They have done all they can to achieve this goal. Last year was a year when they were very determined to achieve it.</s>
580	I would like to stress that despite their will and much to their disappointment, in the year 1390 the Iranian nation once again convinced the enemies and the entire world - with its activities, advances and decisions - that it is capable.	Ina son kowa ya fahimci cewa cewar sabanin abin da suke fatan gani al'ummar Iran ta hanyar ci gaba da tafiya a kan tafarkin da suka rika da kuma irin ci gaban da suka samu da kuma tsayin dakansu sun bada musu kasa a ido da kuma tabbatar wa dukkan duniya ciki kuwa har da makiya din cewa 'lalle za mu iya'.	"<pad> I want everyone to understand that against what they hoped for, the people of Iran by continuing on their path and their progress and their determination have proved to the world including the enemies that ""we can do it.""</s>"
581	The reason why we stress our strengths is to prove that the Iranian nation made use of its capabilities. The Iranian nation proved that it is capable in spite of the will of the ill-wishers who wanted to prove that the Iranian nation was incapable.	Dalilin da ya sanya muke ta magana kan bangarorin karfi da nasarorin da aka samu shi ne don mu tabbatar wa (duniya) cewa al'ummar Iran ta yi amfani da irin wannan karfi da take da shi ne sannan kuma sabanin abin da masu bakar aniya suke son nunawa cewa al'ummar Iran ba za su iya ba, sun tabbatar da cewa lalle za su iya.	<pad> The reason we are talking about the strengths and the successes is to show the world that the people of Iran have used this power and that, contrary to what the arrogants want to show, they have proven that they can do it.</s>
582	We are aware of our weak points. We have our own weak points, but in general, our strengths are far more than our weak points.	Ba wai ba mu da bangarori na rauni ba ne, lalle muna da bangarori na rauni; to amma a yanayi na gaba daya bangaren karfin da muke da shi da kuma irin nasarorin da muka samu sun fi bangarorin raunin yawa.	<pad> No, we don't have weaknesses, we do have them; but in the general context our strengths and our successes are far greater than our weaknesses.</s>
583	"The year 1390 was named ""The Year of Economic Jihad""."	"Mun ba wa shekarar 1390 (da ta gabata) sunan 'Shekarar Kokarin Bunkasa Tattalin Arziki""; a saboda haka a wannan shekarar (zan fara maganata ne) daga batun tattalin arziki."	<pad> We named the year 1390 (last year) as the Year of Economic Expansion; so this year I will start my speech with the economic issue.</s>
584	What is noteworthy is the economic movement of our government officials which was accompanied by the exemplary and praiseworthy cooperation of the people throughout the year 1390.	Lalle irin ayyukann da jami'an kasar nan suka gudanar a fagen tattalin arziki tare da kuma irin hadin kan da mutane suka ba su tsawon shekarar da ta gabatan wani lamari ne abin ambato da jinjinawa.	<pad> The efforts of the government in the field of economic development and the support of the people throughout the year is something to be praised and admired.</s>
585	Among the things that can be mentioned in this regard is the issue of redistributing state subsidies.	Daga cikin abubuwan da za a iya ambato a wannan bangaren shi ne wannan siyasa ta manufantar da irin tallafin da gwamnati take bayarwa.	<pad> One of the examples of this policy is the concentration of government support.</s>
586	All economic experts - both the ones who served in the previous governments and those who serving in the current government - unanimously agree that redistributing state subsidies is a necessity for the country.	Bakin dukkanin masanan tattalin arziki, shin a cikin gwamnatocin da suka gabata ne ko kuma cikin wannan gwamnatin ne sun hadu kan cewa aiwatar da wannan siyasar dai ta zama dole a kasar nan; kowa ya yarda da hakan.	<pad> All economic experts, whether in the previous governments or in this government, agreed that implementing this policy was necessary for the country; everyone agreed on that.</s>
587	In spite of the fact that everybody agreed on the necessity of taking action, nobody had done anything due to the complexities and hardships involved. In the year 1390, the executive and legislative branches of government made efforts and carried out important stages of this work while we were under sanctions and while the hardships and complexities were more than ever before.	Duk kuwa da cewa wannan wani lamari ne da aka yi tarayya a kansa, to amma lamarin ya ci gaba da zama ba tare da an aiwatar da shi saboda irin matsaloli da wahalhalun da ke cikinsa.

But the government and the parliament last year, in the current economic sanctions situation where the difficulty and problem in it is more than ever, have taken the initiative to start implementing this work, and so far a significant part of the plan has been implemented.</s>
588	The work is not finished yet, but what has been done so far by our government officials both in the executive branch and in the Majlis - which have been mostly successful due to the support and cooperation of the people - are very important and remarkable.	Aikin dai ba mai karewa ba ne, to amma abin da ya zuwa yanzu jami'an gwamnati - shin a cikin gwamnatin ne ko kuma a majalisa - suka yi sannan kuma jama'a suka goyi bayansu lalle an samu nasarori kuma an aiwatar da aiki mai muhimmanci abin jinjinawa.	<pad> The work is not over yet, but what the government officials - whether in government or in the House of Commons - have done and the people have backed them is a success and a very important work done.</s>
589	All our honorable people are familiar with the objectives, but it is necessary to reflect on them. The work that has been done is great.	Dukkanin al'ummarmu sun ji su, to amma wajibi ne a yi tunani sosai a kansu. Wannan aikin, aiki ne mai girma; aiki ne mai muhimmanci.	<pad> Everyone in our community has heard them, but we must think carefully about them. This work is a great work; it is an important work.</s>
590	One of the objectives of this law is fair distribution of the state subsidies.	Daya daga cikin manufofin wannan shirin shi ne raba irin tallafin da gwamnati take bayarwa ga al'umma cikin adalci.	<pad> One of the objectives of this program is to share the government's support to the people fairly.</s>
591	I explained in a speech that state subsidies have always been distributed among the people in an unfair way: this is the nature of general subsidies.	A baya a wani jawabi na yi bayani kan hakan cewa a baya ana raba irin wannan tallafi tsakanin bangarori daban-daban na al'umma ne ta hanyar da babu adalci a cikinta; a dabi'ance dai haka aikin raba tallafi yake.	<pad> I have already explained in a previous speech that this aid was distributed among different groups of the community in an unfair way; in fact, that is the nature of the distribution of aid.</s>
592	I have received reliable reports from across the country that targeted subsidies have played a significant role in improving living standards of the lower social classes.	Ina da ingantaccen labari daga bangarori daban-daban na kasar nan da ke nuni da cewa hakan yayi tasiri wajen kyautata rayuwar mutane marasa shi a tsakanin al'umma.	<pad> I have a good report from different parts of the country that it has had a positive impact on improving the lives of the poor in the community.</s>
593	This is one of the goals, which is also the most important objective of the subsidy law.	Wannan daya ne daga cikin manufofin wannan shirin kuma shi ne mafi muhimmancin manufar aiwatar da wannan dokar.	<pad> This is one of the objectives of this program and is the most important purpose of implementing this law.</s>
594	Another goal is to reform the structure of production and the structure of our economy.	Wata manufar kuma ta daban, ita ce gyara tsarin abubuwan da ake samarwa da kuma tsarin tattalin arziki na kasar nan.	<pad> Another goal is to improve the production and economic system of the country.</s>
595	Economic experts unanimously agree that targeted subsidies can resolve this problem. They agree that wasteful and low-yield production can be remedied and a balance can be created between input and output.	Bisa kididdigar masanan tattalin arziki - wanda dukkaninsu sun yi tarayya kan hakan - ana iya gyara hakan ta hanyar aiwatar da wannan shiri na manufantar da irin tallafin da ake bayarwa; hakan zai iya daidaita irin abubuwan da ake samarwa da kuma amfani da shi.	<pad> According to the estimates of economic experts - who all agree on this - this can be corrected by implementing this program of targeting subsidies; it can balance the production and use of resources.</s>
596	Another goal is to manage energy consumption.	Wata manufar kuma ta daban ita ce amfani da makamashin da ake da shi yadda ya dace.	<pad> Another goal is to make the most of the available energy.</s>
597	Because we have been an oil-rich country, we have been in the habit of using gas, natural gas, diesel and kerosene in a wasteful way.	Da yake mu din nan kasa ce da Allah ya albarkace ta da man fetur, don haka mun saba da yin almubazzaranci wajen amfani da man fetur, gas, kananzir ba tare da lura ba.	<pad> Since we are a country blessed with oil, we have been used to waste oil, gas and canned goods without care.</s>
598	Our consumption has been more wasteful than many countries - and in a sense, more wasteful than all countries in the world.	Irin yadda muke amfani da wadannan albarkatu ya dara na da dama daga cikin kasashen duniya - mai yiyuwa ne ma ana iya cewa sama da dukkanin kasashen duniya.	<pad> Our use of these resources is better than that of many other countries in the world - perhaps even above all other countries in the world.</s>
599	Reliable statistics have been published which show that if the subsidy law had not been implemented, we would be consuming gas almost twice the amount we currently do.	Kididdigar da aka fitar, kuma kididdiga ce abar yarda, tana nuna mana cewa idan da a ce har ya zuwa yanzu ba a fara aiwatar da wannan shiri ba, to da kuwa irin amfani da mai da ake yi a kasar nan ya ninka irin yadda ake amfani da shi a halin yanzu har sau biyu.	<pad> The statistics, and they are credible statistics, show that if this plan had not been implemented, the use of oil in the country would have doubled as much as it is now.</s>
600	When we do not produce sufficient gasoline to meet our domestic needs, what do we have to do?	A lokacin da ya zamana ba ma samar da wadataccen man da ake bukata a cikin gida, to me ya wajaba mu aikata?	<pad> When we don't have enough oil to meet our needs in the house, what do we need to do?</s>
601	We would have to import it.	Kenan wajibi ne mu shigo da mai daga waje; wato wajibi ne al'ummar Iran su zamanto masu mika kokon bara zuwa hannun makiya da masu bakar aniya.	<pad> Now we have to import oil from abroad; that is, the people of Iran must be dependent on the enemy and a coward.</s>
602	Today our domestic consumption of gasoline is approximately as much as our production. We do not need to import gasoline, which is a great advantage for the country.	To amma sakamakon wannan aikin an samu nasarar yin tsumulmular mai din. A halin yanzu man da ake amfani da shi a cikin gida kusan ya yi daidai da abin da ake samarwa; saboda haka babu bukatar mu shigo da mai.	<pad> But as a result of this work, the oil was extracted. At present the domestic oil used is roughly equal to the production; so we do not need to import oil.</s>
603	This was done in the year 1390, exactly when our enemies increased their sanctions on us in order to bring our nation to its knees.	Wannan aiki ne da aka yi shi a shekarar 1390 da ta gabata; a daidai lokacin da makiyanmu suka sanya mana takunkumi don su dunkufar da al'ummarmu.	<pad> This work was done in the year 1390; at the same time that our enemies imposed a ban on us to destroy our people.</s>
604	But our youth made efforts and foiled the plots of the enemy with their actions.	To amma matasan cikin al'ummarmu sun yi himma, ta hanyar irin wannan aikin na su sun sami nasarar magance makircin makiya.	<pad> But our young people have been brave, through their work they have managed to overcome the plots of the enemies.</s>
605	Another important economic measure which was taken with the help of our people was in the arena of science and technology.	Wani aiki mai muhimmancin gaske da aka aiwatar da shi a shekaar da ta gabatan, sakamakon himmar jama'a, shi ne abin da aka yi a fagen ilimi da fasaha.	<pad> Another important work that has been done in the past year, thanks to the people's determination, is what has been done in the field of education and technology.</s>
606	Science and technology is one of the pillars of a nation's economic power.	Ilimi da fasaha daya ne daga cikin tushen tabbatar da tattalin arziki da sanya shi tsayawa da kafafunsa.	<pad> Education and technology is one of the pillars of economic development and making it stand on its own.</s>
607	A nation that enjoys advanced knowledge and technology will achieve wealth, political independence, honor and power.	A lokacin da wata al'umma ta sami ilimi da ya ci gaba da fasaha ta zamani, to kuwa za ta sami dukiya haka nan kuma za ta sami karfi na siyasa, za ta zamanto mai mutumci da kuma samun karfi.	<pad> When a nation has developed modern technology, it will have wealth and political power, it will be respected and strong.</s>
608	I am sensitive to the issue of scientific and technological progress because of the key role it plays.

610	According to the reports prepared by reliable scientific centers of world - and not our own scientific centers - the fastest scientific growth is taking place in Iran.

611	Reliable scientific centers of the world reported that in the year 2011 - which ended three months before the year 1390 - the scientific growth of the Iranian nation was 20 percent more than the year 2010. What is the meaning of this?

What does that mean?</s>
612	The Iranian nation acted like that in a situation in which the enemies of the Iranian nation were betting on our collapse and were describing their sanctions as crippling.	An samu hakan ne a daidai lokacin da makiyan al'ummar Iran suka sha alwashin kawar da al'ummar Iran suna cewa mun sanya wa al'ummar Iran takunkumi mai ruguzarwa, to amma sai ga shi al'ummar Iran ta samu nasarar aiwatar da irin wannan aikin.	<pad> This happened at the same time that the enemies of Iran tried to eliminate Iran by saying that we have imposed a sanctions on Iran, but the Iranians managed to do just that.</s>
613	Reliable scientific centers of the world also report that Iran is the top country in the region in terms of its scientific level and that it ranks 17th in the world.

614	These reports are prepared by those who would not refuse to present false reports against us if they could, yet they acknowledge our growth like this. In the year 1390 we made progress in biotechnology. We made progress in nanotechnology.

In 1390 we made progress in biotechnology, nanotechnology, space technology - which was the year that the first human satellite was launched - and nuclear technology, we were able to purify uranium by 20 percent in 1390.</s>
615	In the year 1389 the Americans and others proposed certain preconditions for this 20-percent uranium.	Wannan tace uranium kashi ashirin cikin dari din, shi ne abin da a shekarar 1389 Amurka da sauransu suka ta kafa mana sharudda kafin su ba mu shi.	<pad> This means 20% uranium, which in 1389 the United States and others imposed conditions before they gave us it.</s>
616	We had to prepare it for our research reactor in Tehran, which has been built to produce radiopharmaceuticals: we had run out of 20-percent enriched uranium.	Ya zama wajibi mu samar da makamashi (wato tacaccen uranium kashi ashirin cikin dari) ga cibiyar bincikenmu ta Tehran, saboda kuwa makashin da ake da shi din ya kusan karewa.	<pad> We have to provide energy (or 20 percent clean uranium) to our Tehran research center, because the energy available is almost running out.</s>
617	They proposed certain preconditions for providing this uranium. They said that we had to ship our uranium abroad to be enriched to 20-percent.

618	The Americans used the Brazilian and Turkish governments as intermediaries in order to reach an agreement with us.	Jami'an Brazil da na Turkiya sun zo nan suka zauna da shugaban kasarmu da yin bahasi sannan kuma suka sanya hannu kan wata yarjejeniya.	<pad> Brazil and Turkish officials came here to discuss with our president and sign a deal.</s>
619	After the agreement was signed, the Americans broke their promise: the agreement was not the kind of agreement they wanted. They wanted to win many concessions. They wanted to bully and blackmail us.	To amma bayan da aka sanya hannu kan wannan yarjejeniyar sai Amurkawa suka yi watsi da shi.

They didn't want to sign the agreement, they wanted to get more things, use force and pressure to make their way.</s>
620	Because the Americans broke their promise, the Brazilian and Turkish governments were embarrassed in front of us. This is the story of the 20-percent uranium.	Sakamakon rashin cika alkawarin da Amurkawa suka yi, hakan ya sanya gwamnatocin Brazil da Turkiya cikin kunya. Wannan shi ne lamarin tace sinadarin uranium kashi ashirin cikin dari.	<pad> Because of the Americans' failure to fulfill their promises, it has left Brazil and Turkey in disgrace. This is the reason that they say they have 20 percent uranium oxide.</s>
621	In the year 1390, they produced 20-percent enriched uranium for the research reactor in Tehran and they announced their achievement to the world. Our enemies were astonished.	A shekarar da ta gabatan sun samar da uranium da aka tace kashi ashirin cikin dari din don amfanin cibiyar nukiliyan Tehran sannan kuma suka sanar da hakan ga duniya; haka makiyanmu suka shiga cikin damuwa suka rasa abin yi.	<pad> Last year they produced 20 percent enriched uranium for Tehran's nuclear center and announced it to the world; so our enemies were in great distress and lost for words.</s>
622	Although they knew the nuclear reactor in Tehran only produces radiopharmaceuticals, they refused to provide the 20-percent uranium we needed. The reactor in Tehran fulfills the needs of our hospitals and laboratories across the country and thousands of patients need these radiopharmaceuticals, yet they proposed preconditions to blackmail us.

623	Our youth produced the uranium we needed.	Nan take matasanmu suka samar da shi.	<pad> When my father was a child, he would often make fun of him.</s>
624	The work was complicated and difficult, but our youth managed to do it. Currently various kinds of radiopharmaceuticals are being produced at the research center in Tehran with domestically produced uranium.

Well, our engineers and scientists said we can make this energy by ourselves; and they made it and showed it to the world.</s>
627	This was done in the year 1390.	Wannan lamari ne da ya faru a shekara ta 1390.	<pad> This event took place in the year 1390.</s>
628	The sixfold increase in recombinant drugs and the increase in the export of knowledge-based products and services - these achievements were made in the year 1390.

631	Last week at the end of the year 1390, I visited the Research Institute of Petroleum Industry.	A karshen wannan shekara ta 1390 - wato a wannan makon da ya wuce - na kai rangadi cibiyar bincike na masana'antar mai.	<pad> In the end of this year - last week - I visited the research center of the oil industry.</s>
632	There were certain things in the institute which can be witnessed when touring different other research centers of the country as well: they convince one that these advances are the rule, not the exception. These important advances - which our people would not even dream about - have been made already and they have become the rule.	A nan na ga abubuwa da yawa da kuma irin ci gaban da aka samu a fagage daban-daban na ilimi, wanda ana iya ganin makamancin hakan ma a wasu bangarorin.

So one can say that this progress is not only here. It's things that our people have never dreamed of seeing in the past, but they have been achieved.</s>
633	First of all, jihad-like spirit and thought were predominant in the institute.	A matakin farko shi ne ruhi da tunani na jihadi da ke cikin zukatan masu gudanar da wannan aikin.	<pad> The first level is the spirit and thinking of jihad in the heart of those who perform this work.</s>
634	The scientists were working with a jihad-like spirit. They were working as if they were involved in jihad, as if they were fighting in the battlefield in the way of God.	Wadannan masana suna gudnar da ayyukansu ne da ruhi na jihadi; wato tamkar mutanen da suke yin jihadi, tamkar suna a fagen jihadi saboda Allah ne.	<pad> These scientists are carrying out their work with the spirit of jihad; that is, like people who are fighting, like they are in the field of jihad for Allah.</s>
635	There is a big difference between those who work for the sake of money, social position, fame or knowledge and those who work for the sake of jihad in the way of God.	Akwai bambanci tsakanin mutanen da suke aiki saboda kudi, saboda matsayi, saboda shahara ko kuma saboda shi kansa ilimi din da kuma wadanda suke aiki a matsayin jihadi saboda Allah.	<pad> There is a difference between people who work for money, for status, for fame or for the very knowledge itself and those who work as jihad for Allah.</s>
636	This is very valuable.	Lalle hakan lamari ne mai kima da muhimmancin gaske.	<pad> It is a very precious and important event.</s>
637	The second characteristic is that our scientists consider the sanctions that are imposed on our nation as opportunities.	Siffa ta biyu ita ce na ga cewa masananmu sun mayar da wannan takunkumi da aka sanya wa al'ummarmu zuwa wata dama.	<pad> The second feature is that I see that our wise men have transformed this ban on our community into an opportunity.</s>
638	"During the visit to the institute, which lasted a long time, a few people told me, ""Thank God they imposed sanctions on us."	A yayin wannan rangadi na sa'oi da na kai, wasu mutane sun bayyana min cewa lalle muna gode wa Allah da suka sanya mana takunkumin.	<pad> During this visit, some people told me that they were thankful to God for putting us on this ban.</s>
639	The feeling that the sanctions imposed by the enemies provide us with an opportunity is very valuable.	Wannan ruhi na jin cewa takunkumin da makiya suka sanya mana a matsayin wata dama, lamari ne mai kima da kuma muhimmanci.	<pad> This spirit of seeing the restrictions that our enemies have placed on us as a chance is a precious and important thing.</s>
640	The third characteristic that I noticed among the employees of the institute was their great self-confidence.	Siffa ta uku wacce na ganta a wancan wajen, ita ce irin gagarumar yarda da kai da ake da ita.	<pad> The third thing I noticed there was the kind of great trust that people have in you.</s>
641	Certain parts of the oil industry have been monopolized by three, four countries in the world: they do not allow other countries to access their technologies.	Wasu bangarori na masana'antun mai din wasu 'yan kasashe uku zuwa hudu ne kawai suke da su; ba sa taba bari wani ya sami irin wannan fasahar.	<pad> Some areas of the oil industry are only owned by three to four countries; I have never seen anyone else acquire such technology.</s>
642	Over these years, our country has always asked them to do such important and complex things for us and we have paid for their services.	Tsawon shekaru kasar mu take bukatar a koya mata wannan fagen da wadannan ayyuka masu wahala da rikitarwa sun kashe kudade masu yawa.	<pad> Over the years our country has needed to learn this field and these difficult and complicated tasks have spent a lot of money.</s>
643	"I realized that they were determined and they were saying, ""We can. We will do this on our own."	To amma da idanuwana na ga cewa (masananmu) sun yi himma suna fadin cewa lalle za mu iya.	"<pad> But I saw with my own eyes that they made a promise and said, ""We can do it.""</s>"
644	This self-confidence is very valuable for a nation, for the scientists of a nation, for the youth of a nation.	Irin wannan yarda da kai a tsakanin wata al'umma da wasu masana da matasa na wata al'umma lamari ne mai kimar gaske.	<pad> This kind of cooperation between a community and some experts and young people of another community is very important.</s>
645	Another characteristic is the tendency to employ young people.	Wata siffar kuma ta daban ita ce yarda da matasa.	<pad> Another feature is the ability to accept a challenge.</s>
646	The work is being done by the youth.	Don kuwa aiki yana hannun matasa ne.	<pad> Don't know that the job is in the hands of a young man.</s>
647	The youth are a source of innovation and creativity.	Matasa kuma tushe ne na haske da samar da sabbin abubuwa.	<pad> The young are also the source of light and innovation.</s>
648	Another characteristic is the relationship between industry and university, which has always been among my wishes.	Wata siffar kuma ta daban ita ce alakar masana'antu da jami'oi; wanda hakan ya kasance fatan da na jima ina da shi.	<pad> Another feature is the link between industry and universities; which has been my long-standing dream.</s>
649	I used to advise the officials in charge of the relevant sectors in the previous governments that they should try to establish a relationship between industry and university.	A ko da yaushe na kasance ina shawartar jami'an bangarori daban-daban da suke da alaka da gwamnatocin da suka gabata cewa su yi kokari wajen kulla alaka tsakanin masana'antu da jami'a.	<pad> I've always been advising the various ministries of the previous governments to try to link up the industry and the university.</s>
650	Fortunately I saw at the institute that the relationship has been established.	Abin farin cikin shi ne cewa a wancan wajen na ga cewa an tabbatar da irin wannan alakar.	<pad> I was happy to see that this relationship was being established.</s>
651	Of course, the relationship should be prevalent and all our industries should be linked to our universities. Then both our knowledge and our industries will grow.	Ko da yake tabbas ne hakan ya hada da ko ina, a hada dukkanin masana'antunmu da jami'oi, hakan zai sanya mu samun ci gaban ilimi haka nan kuma bangaren masana'antunmu.	<pad> Although it is certainly everywhere, connecting all our companies with the university, this will allow us to have a further education and business development.</s>
652	This was the situation of the economic sector in the year 1390, a year in which the enemies and ill-wishers of the Iranian nation were constantly trying to intimidate us. Sometimes they made threats. Other times they mounted political pressure on us.	Wannan bangaren tattalin arziki kenan a shekarar 1390; shekarar da tun daga farkonta zuwa karshenta makiya suka ta tada jijiyoyin wuya; a wasu lokutan suna barazana, a wasu lokutan suna yin matsin lamba na siyasa, a wasu lokutan kuma suna sanya mana takunkumi.	<pad> This is the economic situation in 1390; a year that from the beginning to the end the enemies have been fighting hard; sometimes with threats, sometimes with political pressure, sometimes with sanctions.</s>
653	The agents of the US government are making efforts throughout the world to implement the sanctions, hoping that they will harm the Iranian nation and create a rift between the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic.	A halin yanzu 'yan amshin shatan gwamnatin Amurka a duk fadin duniya suna nan suna ta kokari wajen ganin sun aiwatar da wannan takunkumin, a tunaninsu don su cutar da al'ummar Iran da kuma haifar da rikici tsakanin al'ummar Iran da tsarin Musulunci.	<pad> Nowadays, the American proxy governments around the world are working hard to implement this ban, in their view to hurt the people of Iran and create a conflict between the people of Iran and the Islamic system.</s>
654	In the year 1390 we made other great achievements as well, including the active diplomacy that we employed in case of the regional issues.	Akwai wasu manyan nasarorin da aka samu na daban a shekara ta 1390; ciki kuwa har da irin ayyukan diplomasiyya da aka gudanar da suka shafi batutuwan da suke faruwa a wannan yankin a shekarar 1390.	<pad> There were other major successes in the year 1390; including diplomacy efforts regarding the issues of the region in the year 1390.</s>
655	The Conference on Islamic Awakening, the Conference on Palestinian Intifada, the Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, the World Without Terrorism Conference and the Islamic Awakening and Youth Conference were among the activities which were carried out in Tehran.	Gudanar da tarurrukan farkawa ta Musulunci, taron Palastinu, taron kwance damarar makamai, taron kasa da kasa na duniya ba tare da ayyukan ta'addanci ba, taron matasa da farkawa ta Musulunci, dukkanin wadannan suna daga cikin ayyukan da aka gudanar a Tehran.	<pad> The holding of the Iranian Revolution Conferences, the Palestine Conference, the UN conference on non-terrorism, the International Conference on Non-Terrorism, the Iranian Young and Iranian Revolution Conference, all these are some of the events held in Tehran.</s>
656	The Islamic Republic became the center of attention in the world of Islam which has awakened today.	Jamhuriyar Musulunci ta Iran ta zamanto wata cibiyar da idanuwar duniyar musulmi suka koma gare su, wanda a yau sun farka.	<pad> The Islamic Republic of Iran has been a center of attention for the Muslim world, which has woken up today.</s>
657	In the area of economic services, tens of thousands of houses were built in the country and were made available to the people.	A fagen hidima ta tattalin arziki, an gina dubban gidaje da mika su ga jama'a.	<pad> In the framework of economic activities, thousands of houses have been built and offered to the public.</s>
658	These statistics are great. They are important statistics. Houses were built in rural areas.	Wannan dai wani adadi ne mai girman gaske da muhimmanci. An gina gidaje a kauyuka, an gina tituna da manyan hanyoyi.	<pad> This is a very large and important number. Houses have been built in the villages, roads and major roads have been built.</s>
659	"These are the preliminary stages of ""The Decade of Progress and Justice""."	Wadannan abubuwa ne da aka samar da su a wadannan shekaru na ci gaba da tabbatar da adalci.	<pad> These things that have been created over the years have continued to ensure justice.</s>
660	One great example of the praiseworthy movements which were carried out by the Iranian nation in the year 1390 was the parliamentary election that was held on the 12th of Esfand.	Duk da irin wadannan makirce-makirce na makiya da masu mummunar aniya, amma wannan al'umma ta kasance a tsaye da kuma samar da irin wannan ci gaban da aka samu.	<pad> However, despite all these plots of enemies and bad intentions, this community has remained firm and created the progress that has been achieved.</s>
661	Of course, I would stress that the election is not over yet. Our people should show the same magnificence in the second round as well.	Ko da yake ya kamata a fahimci cewa har ya zuwa yanzu ba a kammala zaben ba; ina fatan al'umma za su fito kwansu da kwarkwatansu a lokacin da za a gudanar da zagaye na biyu na zaben.	<pad> Although it should be understood that the election is not yet over; I hope the people will come out in full force when the second round of the election is held.</s>
662	The election was extremely important.	Wannan zaben dai yana da muhimmancin gaske.	<pad> This election is very important.</s>
663	As I have pointed out before, the enemies did everything in their power for around six months in order to discourage the people from taking part in the election.	Ina son in sanar da ku, a baya ma na taba fadi, kimanin watanni shida kenan (makiya) suke ta iyakacin kokarinsu wajen ganin sun kashe gwuiwan al'umma don kada su fito.	<pad> I want to tell you, as I have already said, for about six months (almost) they've been trying to kill the minds of the people so that they can't come out.</s>
664	Sometimes they said the election would be rigged. Other times they said if the people did not take part in the election, the enemies would become less hostile, and they broadcast various kinds of propaganda in order to drive the people away from the polling stations and ballot boxes.	A wani lokaci suna cewa za a yi mgudi; a wani lokacin kuma suna cewa matukar dai mutane suka ki fitowa to irin adawar da makiya suke yi da al'ummar Iran za ta ragu; sun gudanar da nau'oi daban-daban na farfaganda wajen hana mutane fitowa zaben.	<pad> They sometimes say that they are preparing for a coup; sometimes they say that if people do not vote, the hatred of the enemies towards Iran will be reduced; they have used all kinds of propaganda to prevent people from voting.</s>
665	Yet other times they tried to intimidate, discourage and disappoint our people by assassinating our scientists. They carried out three assassinations in less than six months.	A wani lokacin ta hanyar kashe masananmu - wanda cikin kasa da watanni shida, sun aiwatar da irin wannan aikin ta'addancin guda uku - manufarsu ita ce su razama mutanenmu, su kashe musu gwuiwa.	<pad> sometimes by killing our friends - who in less than six months, have carried out three such terrorist acts - their purpose is to intimidate our people, to debilitate them.</s>
666	Over the past ten years, the rate of voter turnout in the congressional elections - the Senate and the House of Representatives - has never reached forty percent.	Tsawon shekaru goman da suka gabata irin adadin fitowar mutane a lokacin zabubbubakn majalisar dokoki da ta dattawa da ta wakilai (a Amurka) ba ta kai kashi 40 cikin dari ba.	<pad> For the last five years, the percentage of people who voted in the US House of Representatives and Senate elections did not even reach 40%.</s>
667	If you compare this with the turnout rate of the Iranian people and their dynamism and presence, then the significance of the matter will be revealed.	To ku kwatanta hakan da al'ummar Iran - ku dubi irin wannan nishadi da fitowar da mutane suke yi - to a irin wannan lokacin ne muhimmancin lamarin zai fito fili.	<pad> Compare that to the people of Iran - see this joy and enthusiasm - then the importance of the matter will come out clear.</s>
668	Through those pressures, through that psychological warfare, through those threats, through those assassinations, they wanted to make the 12th of Esfand a day of disappointment for the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic, but despite their will and much to their disappointment, the 12th of Esfand became a day of honor and glory for the Islamic Republic and the people of Iran.	Ta hanyar irin wannan matsin lambar, ta hanyar irin wannan wasa da hankali da irin wadannan barazana da wannan kisan gillan suna so ne wannan rana ta 12 ga watan Esfand (ranar da aka gudanar da zaben 'yan majalisa a Iran) ta zamanto ranar raba gari tsakanin al'umma da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci.

But instead of what they hoped, this day has become a day of glory for the Islamic republic and the people of Iran.</s>
669	The parliamentary election acted as an honest and powerful media outlet.	Lalle wannan zaben ya zamanto wata kafar watsa labarai mai gaskiya da kuma karfi.	<pad> This election has certainly been a credible and powerful medium of communication.</s>
670	They report events that have not happened in Iran and they do not report the events that have happened, but they cannot deny the election.

672	The election presented an accurate picture of the Iranian nation to the world like a great and powerful media outlet.

800	They try to achieve this goal through sanctions, threats, keeping our managers busy with secondary issues and diverting the attention of the great Iranian nation and outstanding personalities of the country to issues that are not on the list of our priorities. The second goal is to deny our advances in their propaganda campaigns. Today there is a massive propaganda network in the world with thousands of different types of media outlets whose goal is to prove that there are no advances in Iran, to deny the victories that the Iranian has achieved, to magnify the existing weaknesses and attract everybody's attention to them, and to hide the strengths that exist in different parts of the country and are visible to just and impartial people.

The second thing is to deny and deny these progresses in their media. There are now thousands of different media outlets around the world that have been engaged in this work to show the world that there is no progress made by the Iranians.</s>

803	Of course, he has not mentioned the strengths that our nation enjoys, the positive and constructive efforts that are being made in our country and the great victories that our nation has achieved.

862	Our youth made certain achievements that would have been impossible in the absence of the sanctions. In the area of infrastructure, in terms of the achievements that were made last year, the year 1391 stands out among the previous years.

880	The events that happened in the year 1391 contain a big lesson for us. The lesson is that a vibrant nation will never be brought to its knees as a result of the enemies' threats, pressure and harsh measures.	Akwai darussa masu girma cikin abubuwan da suka faru a shekara ta 1391 a gare mu; wannan darasin kuwa shi ne cewa duk wata al'ummar da take a raye, to barazana da matsin lamba da takuri na makiya ba za su taba dunkufar da ita ba.	<pad> There are great lessons in what happened in 1391 for us; the lesson is that any society that lives, threats, pressures and oppressions of enemies will never be able to destroy it.</s>
881	It became clear to us and to all those who follow up the issues of Iran that what is important for a nation is relying on its own capacities, trusting Allah the Exalted, having faith in itself and not relying on its enemies.	Ta bayyana mana da kuma dukkanin wadanda suka sanya ido kan abubuwan da suka shafi Iran, cewa abin da ke da muhimmanci ga wata al'umma, shi ne dogaro da irin karfin da take da shi, dogaro da Allah Madaukakin Sarki, dogara da kanta da kuma rashin dogaro da makiya.	<pad> She explained to us and all those who have been watching the situation in Iran that what is important for a nation is to depend on its own power, on God Almighty, on its own self and not to depend on its enemies.</s>

884	Of course, we identified our weaknesses as well. After all, this is the purpose of war games.	Tabbas mun fahimci irin raunin da muke da su; wannan ita ce siffar atisaye.	<pad> We certainly understand our limitations; this is the form of research.</s>
885	In a military exercise, military units identify both their weaknesses and their strengths and they try to eliminate their weaknesses.

886	We identified our weaknesses.	Mu mun fahimci irin raunin da muke da su.	<pad> We understand our weaknesses.</s>
887	Our economic weaknesses - which led to harsh conditions for certain groups of people - include dependence on oil, disregarding large-scale economic policies of the country and adopting policies and decisions on a day-to-day basis.

889	Another great lesson that we learnt was that our country enjoys firm foundations.	Wani babban darasin da muka dauka na daban shi ne cewa tushen ginin kasar nan tushe ne mai karfi.	<pad> Another big lesson we learned was that the foundation of the country is a strong foundation.</s>
890	When the foundations of a country become firm, the effect of the enemies' hostile actions is minimized.	A lokacin da tushe ya zamanto mai karfi, to kuwa makircin makiya ba za su yi tasiri sosai ba.	<pad> When the base is strong, then the enemies' plots will not have much effect.</s>
891	In this great country which enjoys firm foundations, if government officials accept their responsibility and adopt wise measures, if managers stay together and cooperate - which is my constant advice to our government officials and managers - if our managers act in a wise and intelligent way, then we can turn every threat into an opportunity, just as we did in the year 1391 and managed to move forward.

893	Of course, the economy of the country is an important issue and I have constantly stressed its importance over the past few years, but it is not the only issue.

898	Through its advances, our nation proved that refusing to live under the hegemony of America does not mean backwardness. This is an important point.

899	Powerful people of the world and colonialists - at a time when there was direct colonialism - tried to prove to nations of the world that if they wanted to have a good life and make progress, they had to live under their hegemony. And today America is doing the same thing.

900	The Iranian nation proved that this is a lie.	Al'ummar Iran ta tabbatar da cewa hakan karya ce.	<pad> The people of Iran have confirmed that it is a lie.</s>
901	Our nation proved that being independent of America and other superpowers not only will not cause backwardness, but it will also bring about progress.

903	Thirty years of experience lie in front of our eyes. Notice what has happened in the thirty years that the Islamic Republic has been in power. Notice where the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation used to be and where they are now.	Muna da irin wannan kwarewar ta shekaru talatin.

907	One example is the issue of producing twenty-percent enriched fuel for the research reactor in Tehran, which produces the important radiopharmaceuticals that our country needs.

913	While they expected that the Islamic Republic would beg them for twenty-percent enriched fuel, the Islamic Republic announced that it had produced twenty-percent enriched uranium inside the country and that it did not need the enemies.

924	The second point is that the Americans send messages to us through different channels, asking us to negotiate with them regarding the nuclear issue. They both send messages to us and discuss the proposal in their global propaganda.

925	High- and middle-ranking officials of America repeatedly say that alongside the P5+1 talks regarding the nuclear issue, America and the Islamic Republic should hold one-on-one negotiations over the issue.

928	What they mean is that we should sit down together and talk so that Iran accepts their views.	Abin da suke nufi da tattaunawa, ita ce mu zauna, mu tattauna don ku yarda da abin da muke fadi!	<pad> What they mean by talking is that we sit down and talk to you so you agree with what we're saying.</s>
929	The goal has been announced in advance: Iran must accept their view. For this reason, we have always announced that this is not negotiation.	A saboda haka ne a koda yaushe muka sanar da kuma cewa wannan ba tattaunawa ba ce; wannan tilasci ne, Iran kuwa ba za ta taba mika wuya ba.	<pad> For that reason, we have always said and we will always say that this is not a negotiation; this is a release, Iran which will never surrender.</s>
930	I am not optimistic about these statements, but I am not opposed either.	Ni dai ba ni da wani kyakkyawan fata kan irin wadannan abubuwan da suke fadi, to amma ba wai ina hanawa ba ne.	<pad> I don't have a good feeling about what they say, but it's not that I'm upset.</s>
931	In this regard, there are a few things that I should clarify.	To sai dai akwai wasu batutuwa da wajibi ne in fayyace su:	<pad> But there are some things I have to explain.</s>
932	The first point is that the Americans constantly send messages - sometimes in writing - that they are not after regime change in Iran. This is what they are telling us.	Batu na farko shi ne cewa Amurkawa a kai a kai suna aiko mana da sako, a wani lokaci a rubuce, wani lokacin kuma sako suke aikowa, suna cewa mu dai ba mu da nufin kifar da gwamnatin Musulunci (ta Iran); haka suke gaya mana.	<pad> The first thing is that the Americans often send us messages, sometimes in writing, sometimes by phone, saying that we don't want to topple the Islamic government (of Iran); that's what they tell us.</s>
933	The answer is that we are not concerned about whether or not you have intentions of overthrowing the Islamic Republic although you constantly insist that you do not have such intentions.	Amsarmu ita ce cewa mu dai ba mu damu ko kuna da nufin kifar da tsarin Musulunci ko kuma a'a ba, ballantana ma ku dinga fadi a halin yanzu cewa ku ba ku da niyyar sauya wannan tsari na Musulunci.	<pad> Our answer is that we don't care whether you want to overthrow the Islamic system or not, and even less if you say now that you don't want to change this Islamic system.</s>
934	Even the day when you had intentions of overthrowing the Islamic Republic and you announced this openly, you could not do anything, and you will not be able to do anything in the future either.	A wancan lokacin da kuka kasance kuna da niyyar kifar da tsarin Musuluncin, sannan kuma a fili kuke fadin hakan, kun gagara yin wani abu, a nan gaba ma ba za ku iya yin wani abu ba.	<pad> When you were trying to overthrow the system of Islam, and you were openly saying it, you failed to do anything, and you will never be able to do anything in the future.</s>
935	The second point is that the Americans constantly send us messages, telling us that they are sincere in their offers of rational negotiation.	Batu na biyu: shi ne cewa Amurkawa suna ta aiko da sakonni cewa mu da gaske muke yi cikin batun tattaunawar.	<pad> Second: The Americans are sending messages that we are serious about the discussion.</s>
936	They claim that they sincerely want to have rational negotiations with Iran - that is to say, they claim that they do not want imposition.	Wato da gaske muna son tattaunawa da ku sannan kuma tattaunawar da ta yi daidai da hankali; wato ba tattaunawa ta tilasci ba.	<pad> We really want to talk with you and a fair and reasonable conversation; not a free-for-all conversation.</s>
937	In response, I would say, we have told you many times that we are not after nuclear weapons and you say that you do not believe us.	To ina gaya musu cewa: A lokuta da dama mun sha gaya muku cewa mu dai ba ma nufin kera makaman kare dangi, amma kuna fadin cewa ba ku yarda ba.	<pad> I told them: We have already told you many times that we don't want to build nuclear weapons, but you say you don't agree.</s>
938	Why would we believe your statements then?	To da wani dalilin ne mu ma za mu yarda da abin da kuke fadi?	<pad> For some reason we don't agree with what you say.</s>
939	When you are not prepared to accept a rational and sincere statement, why would we accept your statements which have been disproved many times?	A lokacin da ya zamana ku din nan ba a shirye kuke ku amince da wata magana ta gaskiya wacce ta yi daidai da hankali ba, da wani dalilin ne za mu yarda da abin da kuke fadi wadanda a lokuta da dama kun tabbatar da sabanin hakan?	<pad> When you're not willing to accept the truth that is right and reasonable, for what reason do we believe what you say that you often prove the opposite of it?</s>
940	Our interpretation is that offers of negotiation are an American tactic to mislead public opinion in the world and in our country.	Fahimtarmu cikin wannan shawara ta tattaunawa da Amurkawa suke gabatarwa, wata dabara ce ta yaudara da kuma wasa da hankulan mutane; mutanen duniya da kuma mutanen kasar mu.	<pad> Our understanding of the American offer of dialogue is a trick to deceive and manipulate the people; the people of the world and our people.</s>
941	You should prove that this is not the case.	Wajibi ne ku tabbatar da cewa ba haka ba ne.	<pad> You have to make sure that it isn't true.</s>
942	Can you prove this?	Shin za ku iya tabbatarwa?	<pad> Can you confirm?</s>
943	I would like to take this opportunity to say that one of their propaganda techniques is that they sometimes start rumors that certain people have negotiated with the Americans on behalf of the Leader.	A wannan wajen ina son in sanar da cewa daya daga cikin dabarunsu shi ne cewa a wani lokaci su kan yada jita-jitan cewa wasu mutane daga wajen Jagora, sun tafi sun tattauna da Amurkawa.	<pad> At this point I want to tell you that one of their tricks was that they sometimes spread rumors that some people from the President's office had gone and talked with the Americans.</s>
944	This is another propaganda tactic and a downright lie.	Wannan wata dabara ce ta farfaganda, sannan kuma karya ce tsagoronta.	<pad> This is a propaganda trick, and a very big lie.</s>
945	So far nobody has negotiated with them on behalf of the Leader.	Ya zuwa yanzu babu wani daga bangaren Jagora da ya tattauna da su.	<pad> No one from the leadership has yet talked to him.</s>
946	The third point is that on the basis of our experiences and careful analysis of the existing conditions, our interpretation is that the Americans do not want the nuclear negotiations to end.	Batu na uku: shi ne cewa abin da muka fahimta, sakamakon kwarewa da kuma sanya ido kan fage da muke yi, shi ne cewa Amurka dai ba ta son a kawo karshen wannan tattaunawa ta nukiliya.	<pad> The third point: what we understand, from our experience and our monitoring of the field, is that the United States does not want to end this nuke negotiation.</s>
947	The Americans do not want the nuclear conflict to be resolved, otherwise if they wanted these negotiations to reach a solution, the solution would be very close by and easy to reach.	Amurkawa ba sa son a gama wannan tattaunawa ta nukiliya da kuma magance wannan matsalar. Idan kuwa ba haka ba, idan da suna son a kawo karshenta da kuma magance matsalar, to hanyar magancewar, hanya ce da take a fili kuma mai sauki.	<pad> The Americans don't want to end this nuclear talks and solve the problem. If not, if they want to end it and solve the problem, then the solution is clear and simple.</s>
948	In the nuclear issue, Iran only wants the world to recognize its right to enrichment, which is Iran's natural right.	Abin da Iran take so dangane da batun nukiliyan, shi ne kawai duniya ta amince da hakkin da take da shi na tace sinadarin uranium, wanda hakan wani hakkin ta ne.	<pad> What Iran is doing with its nuclear program is only trying to get the world to accept its right to produce uranium, which is also a right of Iran.</s>
949	Government officials of the countries that are claiming to be after a solution should admit that the Iranian nation has a right to domestic nuclear enrichment for peaceful purposes.	Kasashen da suke takama da karfi na duniya su amince da cewa al'ummar Iran tana da hakkin tace sinadarin uranium don manufa ta zaman lafiya a cikin kasarta sannan kuma da kanta.	<pad> The world's powers agree that the people of Iran have the right to enrich uranium for peace purposes in their country and for their own use.</s>
950	Is this too much to expect? This is what we have always demanded, and it is exactly what they do not want [us to have].	Shin wannan wani fata ne mai girma? Wannan shi ne abin da a koda yaushe muke fadi. To hakan ne ba sa so.	<pad> Is this a great hope? That's what we always say. But that's not true.</s>
951	They say they are concerned that we might go after producing nuclear weapons.	Suna fadin cewa mu dai muna cikin damuwar cewa ku din nan za ku kama hanyar kera makaman nukiliya.	<pad> They said that we are worried that they will start building nuclear weapons.</s>
952	"The ones who are saying this are no more than a few countries whose names I mentioned earlier, and they call themselves ""the global community""."	Su din nan kuwa 'yan wasu kasashe ne wadanda na ambaci sunayensu a baya. Suna kiran kansu da sunan 'kasashen duniya'.	"<pad> They are the people of other countries that I mentioned above. They call themselves the ""world nations.""</s>"
953	They say that the global community is concerned.	Suna fadin cewa 'kasashen duniya' suna cikin damuwa.	"<pad> They say that the ""world"" is in a state of concern.</s>"
954	No, the global community is not at all concerned.	A'a, kasashen duniya dai ba sa cikin wata damuwa.	<pad> No, the world is not in a rush.</s>
955	The majority of the countries in the world are on the Islamic Republic's side and they support our demand because it is a legitimate demand.	Mafi yawa daga cikin kasashen duniya suna goyon bayan Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma bukatarmu, sun yi hakan ne saboda wannan bukata ta al'ummar Iran wata bukace ta gaskiya.	<pad> Most of the world's countries support the Islamic Republic and our demand, they do so because this demand of the Iranian people is a legitimate demand.</s>
956	We were never opposed to the supervision and regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency.	Su amince da hakkin da Iran take da shi na tace sinadarin urnium, sannan kuma don kawar da wannan damuwar, suna iya aiwatar da dokokin hukumar kula da makamashin nukiliya ta duniya.	<pad> They agree with the right of Iran to enrich uranium, and to ease this concern, they can implement the rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</s>
957	Whenever we are close to a solution, the Americans cause a problem in order to prevent reaching a solution.	A duk lokacin da muka kusan kai wa ga hanyar magance matsalar, nan take Amurkawa za su sanya wata katanka da hana kai wa ga wannan hanya ta magance matsalar.	<pad> Every time we approached a solution, the Americans would put a hurdle and prevent us from reaching that solution.</s>
958	My assumption and interpretation is that their goal is to keep the issue unresolved so that they can have a pretext for exerting pressure on us.	Manufarsu kamar yadda muke iya fahimta ita ce suna son wannan lamarin ya ci gaba ne don su sami abin da za su dinga yin matsin lamba.	<pad> Their purpose, as we can understand, is to keep this situation going so that they can continue to pressure on it.</s>
959	And as they themselves said, the purpose of the pressure is to cripple the Iranian nation. Of course, much to the dismay of the enemy, the Iranian nation will not be crippled.	Wadannan matsin lamba kuwa, kamar yadda su da kansu suke fadi mai gurguntarwa ga al'ummar Iran. Koda yaushe tabbas ba za su iya gurguntar da al'ummar Iran ba.	<pad> These pressures, as they say, are debilitating to the people of Iran. However, they will never be able to debilitate the people of Iran.</s>
960	The fourth point regarding this issue is that if the Americans sincerely want to reach a solution, I will give them the solution.	Batu na hudu kuma na karshe dangane da wannan lamarin shi ne cewa idan har Amurkawa da gaske suna son a kawo karshen wannan lamarin, to zan gabatar musu da wata mafita.	<pad> The fourth and final point about this matter is that if the Americans really want to end this situation, they should offer a solution.</s>
961	The solution is that the Americans should stop being hostile towards the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation.	Wannan hanya kuwa ita ce: Amurkawa su kawo karshen kiyayyar da suke nunawa Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma al'ummar Iran.	<pad> The only way is: the Americans end their hostility towards the Islamic Republic and the people of Iran.</s>
962	This is the right solution: they should stop being hostile if they want to put an end to the problems that exist between us - and they announce that they really want to resolve the problems that exist between Iran and America.	Idan har suna son a kawo karshen matsalolin da suke a tsakaninmu - kamar yadda suke fadin cewa muna son ya zamanto babu wata matsala tsakanin Iran da Amurka - to su kawo karshen wannan kiyayyar da suke nuna mana.	<pad> If they really want to end the problems between us - as they say that they want no problem between Iran and the US - then they should end this hatred they show us.</s>
963	It is thirty-four years that different American administrations have designed various kinds of hostilities towards us based on a wrong understanding of Iran and the Iranians.	Shekaru talatin da hudu kenan gwamnatocin daban-daban na Amurka, sakamakon mummunar fahimtar Iran da al'ummar kasar da suka yi, suke ta tsara makirce-makircen cutar da al'ummar Iran.	<pad> For 34 years, the US governments have been planning tactics to harm the people of Iran.</s>
964	Since the first year after the victory of the Islamic Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, they have been hostile towards us.	Tun daga shekarar farko ta nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci da kuma kafa gwamnatin Musulunci, suke nuna mana kiyayya.	<pad> From the first year of the Islamic Revolution and the formation of the Islamic government, they have shown us their hatred.</s>
965	They have worked against our economy.	A fagen tsaro, sun tsara shirye-shiryen cutar da tsaronmu; sun gudanar da ayyuka na kiyayya, sun keta mana hurumin kasar mu; sun goyi bayan manya da kananan makiyanmu shekaru aru-aru; sun gudanar da tsare-tsare na cutar da tattalin arzikinmu; sun yi amfani da dukkanin karfin da suke da shi wajen cutar da al'ummar Iran.	<pad> In the field of security, they have designed plans to undermine our security; they have conducted activities of hatred, violated our sovereignty; they have supported our great and small enemies for centuries; they have developed plans to undermine our economic economy; they have used all their power to harm the people of Iran.</s>
966	Therefore, I would like to give a piece of advice to American officials: if they are after a rational solution, the rational solution is that they should rectify their policies. They should rectify the way they act and they should stop being hostile towards the Iranian nation.	A saboda haka ina kiran jami'an Amurka; idan har suna neman hanyar da ta dace da hankali ne, to kuwa hanyar da ta dace da hankalin ita ce su gyara siyasarsu, su gyara ayyukansu sannan kuma su kawo karshen kiyayyar da suke yi da al'ummar Iran. To wannan shi ne karshen wannan bahasin.	<pad> So I call on the American officials; if they are looking for a reasonable way, then the reasonable way is to correct their policy, correct their behavior and end their hostility towards the people of Iran. That's the end of this discussion.</s>
967	I would like to briefly discuss another issue: the crucial issue of elections.	Akwai wani bahasin na daban wanda ko da a takaice ne wajibi ne in yi ishara da shi, shi ne kuwa batun zabe mai matukar muhimmanci.	<pad> There is another topic that I must mention, even in a brief way, and it is the matter of very important elections.</s>
968	"In our country, elections are the manifestation of ""political valor""."	Zabe a kasarmu wata alama ce ta kumaji na siyasa.	<pad> Elections are a symbol of political and social change.</s>
969	Elections are the manifestation of political valor, the manifestation of the power of the Islamic Republic, the manifestation of the pride and credibility of the Islamic system. The credibility of the Islamic Republic depends on elections, the presence of the people at polling stations and their votes that elect managers of the country.	Zabe kuwa, alama ce ta kumaji na siyasa; wata alama ce dake tabbatar da tsayin dakan tsarin Musulunci; alama ce ta mutumcin tsarin. Mutumcin Jamhuriyar Musulunci yana cikin zabe da fitowar mutane a lokacin zabe da kuma tasirin daidaikun mutane cikin zaben jami'an kasa.	<pad> The election is also a symbol of political culture; a symbol that confirms the stability of the Islamic system; a symbol of the system's dignity. The dignity of the Islamic Republic is in the election and the turnout at the time of the election and the influence of individuals in the national assembly election.</s>
970	Elections are the manifestation of our national willpower, the manifestation of Islamic democracy.	Zabe alama ce ta irada ta kasa, alama ce ta tsarin demokradiyya ta Musulunci.	<pad> Voting is a symbol of the will of the nation, a symbol of the system of Islamic democracy.</s>
971	Therefore, because of the importance that our elections enjoy, the enemies of the Iranian nation have always tried to take enthusiasm and excitement out of the elections.	A saboda haka bisa la'akari da muhimmancin da zabe yake da shi ne ya sanya makiyan al'ummar Iran a koda yaushe suke kokarin haifar da fitina cikin zaben Iran.	<pad> So because of the importance of the election, the enemies of the people of Iran have always tried to create a crisis in the Iranian election.</s>
972	They have designed plots to prevent the people from going to the ballot boxes.	Sun tsara tsare-tsaren da za su hana mutane fitowa zaben, su kashe musu gwuiwa da kuma sanya su yanke kauna.	<pad> They have designed strategies to prevent people from voting, demoralize them and make them feel abandoned.</s>
973	Over the years that we have held many elections - including parliamentary and presidential elections - our enemies have always tried to decrease voter turnout and make our elections less enthusiastic, and this is because of the significant role that elections play in the affairs of our country.	Tsawon shekarun da muka yi muna gudanar da zabe - shin zaben majalisa ne ko kuma zaben shugaban kasa - a koda yaushe makiyanmu sun yi kokari wajen ganin zaben bai yi armashi ba. Hakan kuwa saboda irin muhimmancin da zabe yake da shi ne a kasar nan.	<pad> Over the years we have been holding elections - whether it be parliamentary or presidential - our enemies have always tried to see that the election does not go well. This is because of the importance of the election in this country.</s>
974	Now I would like to discuss a few points regarding the elections. Of course, the elections are more than two months away.	Bari in fadi wasu abubuwa a babin zaben. Koda yake akwai watanni biyu da wani abu da suka saura.	<pad> I'm going to say some things about the election. Although there are two and a half months left.</s>
975	For the time being, there are a few points that I would like to discuss.	Amma a halin yanzu dai zan yi ishara da wasu abubuwa.	<pad> But for now I'll just be making a reference to some things.</s>
976	The first point is that what is most important is massive presence of the people in the elections.	A matakin farko, batu na farko a babin zabe shi ne cewa fitowar jama'a kwansu da kwarkwatansu a lokacin zaben lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske.	<pad> First of all, the first point in the election chapter is that the participation of the people in the election is very important.</s>
977	Enthusiastic elections in the country and the presence of the people at the polling stations can neutralize the threats by the enemies. It can disappoint the enemy. It can ensure the security of the country.	Fitowar jama'a a lokacin zabe yana iya rage tasirin barazanar makiya; tana iya sanya makiya yanke kauna da kuma lamunce tsaron kasar nan.	<pad> The participation of the people in the election can reduce the effect of enemy threats; it can make the enemy lose hope and compromise the security of the country.</s>
978	Our dear people in all parts of the country should know this. Their massive presence at the polling stations plays a role in the future of the country, in our national security, in our independence, in our national wealth, in our economy and in all other important issues of the country.	Ya kamata al'ummarmu a duk inda suke a fadin kasar nan su san cewa, gagarumar fitowarsu a lokacin zabe, za ta yi tasiri cikin makomar kasar nan; haka nan cikin tsaro, ‘yanci, kiyaye arzikin kasa, tattalin arziki, haka nan cikin dukkanin batutuwa masu muhimmanci na kasar nan.	<pad> Our people should know that their large turnout in the election will affect the future of our country; as well as security, freedom, protection of national resources, economic growth, and all important issues of our country.</s>
979	Therefore, the first point is that with Allah's assistance and with the determined efforts of the Iranian nation, there should be a massive voter turnout in the elections.	Wannan shi ne batu na farko; wato cikin yardar Allah da taimakon Ubangiji da kuma himmar al'ummar Iran, zaben ya zamanto gagarumin zabe da mutane za su fito.	<pad> This is the first point; that with God's grace and the help of God and the will of the people of Iran, the election became a largely popular election.</s>
980	The second point is that all political orientations and currents that have faith in the Islamic Republic should take part in the elections.	Batu na biyu: shi ne cewa wajibi ne dukkanin jam'iyyu da kungiyoyi da suka yi imani da Jamhuriyar Musulunci su shigo cikin wannan zaben.	<pad> Second: It is necessary for all the parties and organizations that believe in the Islamic Republic of Iran to participate in this election.</s>
981	This is both a right and a responsibility that lies on the shoulders of everybody.	Hakan wani hakki ne na kowa da kowa, haka nan kuma wani nauyi ne da ke wuyan kowa.	<pad> That is a right of everyone, and a responsibility that everyone has.</s>
982	Elections do not belong to a particular political orientation or a particular intellectual and political current.	Zabe ba na wata kungiya guda ko kuma wata jam'iyya mai ra'ayi guda na siyasa ba ne.	<pad> The election is not a matter of one organization or one political party.</s>
983	All those who believe in the Islamic Republic and in the independence of the country, all those who care about the future of the country, all those who care about our national interests should take part in the elections.	Wajibi ne dukkanin wadanda suka yi imani da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma ‘yancin wannan kasar, sannan kuma suke ba da muhimmanci ga makomar wannan kasar da kuma kishin ci gaban al'umma, su shigo cikin wannan zaben.	<pad> It is necessary for all those who believe in the system of the Islamic Republic and its freedom, and who care about the future of this country and the progress of the people, to participate in this election.</s>
984	Turning away from the elections is appropriate for those who are opposed to the Islamic Republic.	Juya baya ga zaben, lamari ne da ya dace da wadanda suke adawa da wannan tsarin.	<pad> The withdrawal of the vote is a good option for those who oppose this system.</s>
985	The third point is that it is the votes of the people that determine everything.	Batu na uku: shi ne cewa ra'ayi da kuri'ar mutane ita ce mai ayyana sakamakon zaben.	<pad> The third point: is that the people's opinion and vote is the only one that determines the result of the election.</s>
986	You should research, observe carefully and consult those you trust so that you can identify and vote for the most qualified candidate.	Ku da kanku ne zaku gudanar da bincike kan ‘yan takaran da suka tsaya zaben, ku yi shawara da mutanen da kuka yarda da su don ku sami damar gano mutumin da ya fi dacewa don ku zabe shi.	<pad> You will do your own research on the applicants, talk to trusted people to find the best person to vote for.</s>
987	The Leader has only one vote.	Ni dai ba ni da kuri'ar da ta wuce guda daya.	<pad> I don't have more than one vote.</s>
988	Just like the rest of our people, I have only one vote and until the time I cast my vote into the ballot box, nobody will know what my vote is.	Ni din nan, kamar sauran mutane, kuri'a guda nake da ita, sannan kuma wannan kuri'ar kafin in jefa ta a akwatin zabe babu wani mutum da ya san ga waye zan kada ta.	<pad> I, like all others, have only one vote, and before I put it in the ballot box no one knows who I'm going to vote for.</s>
989	The people at the polling station might decide to open the ballot box, identify my handwriting and find out who I have voted for.	Na'am mai yiyuwa ne mutanen da suke kula da akwatin zaben, a lokacin da suka bude, su gane rubutuna don haka su fahimci wanda na kada wa kuri'a.	<pad> No, it is probably possible that the people who are watching over the ballot box, when they open it, will read the writing so that they can understand who I've voted for.</s>
990	If such a claim is made, it is false.	Idan har wani ya fadi haka, to lalle ba gaskiya ba ne.	<pad> If anyone says that, it's not true.</s>
991	Of course, unfortunately these days different statements are commonly attributed to different people through the use of the new means of communication - short message services and other such things.	Tabbas a wadannan ranaku da kuma irin wadannan kafafen watsa labarai masu ban mamaki da ake da su - irin wadannan sakonnin na wayar salula da ake aikawa da sauransu - a ta yadawa da kuma jingina maganganu ga wasu mutane na daban.	<pad> These days and with all the amazing media - these text messages and so on - people are spreading and attributing things to others.</s>
992	A person might send thousands of text messages.	Mai yiyuwa ne mutum guda ya aika da dubban sakonni.	<pad> It is possible that one person sent thousands of messages.</s>
993	I have reports that during the elections, several hundreds of millions of text messages might be sent and received every day.	An kawo min rahoton cewa mai yiyuwa ne a ranakun zabe, a aika daruruwan miliyoyin irin wadannan sakonni.	<pad> I was told that it is likely that on the day of the election, hundreds of millions of these messages will be sent.</s>
994	Take care not be influenced by such things.	To ku lura sosai, kada ku tasirantu da irin wadannan abubuwa da ake aikowa.	<pad> Be careful, don't be fooled by such things.</s>
995	Of course, every citizen or political activist may try to encourage others to vote for a particular candidate. Nothing is wrong with this. However, in this regard nobody will hear anything from me.	Na'am ko wane mutum ko kuma wata jam'iyya ta siyasa tana iya janyo hankulan sauran mutane zuwa gare ta - babu matsala cikin hakan - to amma dangane da hakan, babu wani da zai ji wani abu daga gare ni.	<pad> No, any individual or political party can attract others to it - no problem with that - but regarding that, no one will hear anything from me.</s>
996	In the meantime, the people can speak to one another, give advice, try to change each other's opinion and help one another to identify the most qualified candidate.	Ala kulli hal mutane suna iya shawara da kuma taimakawa juna wajen gano mutumin da ya fi dacewa.	<pad> However, people can advise and help each other to find the best person.</s>
997	In any case, the criterion is the votes of the people.	Tabbas mizanin dai shi ne ra'ayi da kuma kuri'ar mutane.	<pad> The Tabbas metric is the opinion and vote of people.</s>
998	The fourth point is that everybody should accept the rule of law, be it elections or anything else.	Batu na hudu shi ne cewa cikin lamurran da suka shafi zabe da wadanda ba na zabe ba, wajibi ne kowa ya mika kai ga doka; a girmama doka.	<pad> The fourth point is that in all matters of election and non-election, it is necessary for everyone to submit to the law; to respect the law.</s>
999	The events of the year 1388 - which inflicted losses on the country - took place because certain people decided not to accept the law. They decided not to accept the votes of the people.	Abin da ya faru a shekarar 1388 (2009 bayan zaben shugaban kasa) - wanda ya cutar da kuma haifar da hasarori ga kasar nan - ya samo asali ne daga rashin girmama dokar da wasu suka yi. Ba sa so su girmama ra'ayin mutane.	<pad> The crisis of 1388 (2009 after the presidential election) - which was painful and costly to the country - began with some people not respecting the law. They didn't want to respect the opinion of others.</s>
1000	For example, the people might vote against what I want, but I must accept their vote.	Mai yiyuwa ne ra'ayin mutane ya saba wa abin da nake so; to amma wajibi ne in girmama hakan.	<pad> People's opinion may not agree with mine, but I have to respect it.</s>
1001	Everybody must accept what the majority of the people vote for.	Wajibi ne a girmama abin da mafi yawan al'umma suka zaba.	<pad> It is necessary to respect what the majority of the people have chosen.</s>

1019	The meeting is the symbol of the government's serious attention to the issue of economy in the current sensitive conditions of the world, the region and the country.	A wani bangare taron mu na yau taro ne da ke nuni da wani lamari, wato alamar irin muhimmancin da wannan tsarin ya ke ba wa lamarin tattalin arziki a irin wannan yanayi mai tsananin muhimmanci na duniya, wannan yanki da kuma kasar nan.	<pad> In another part of our meeting, we are showing a sign, that this system is giving priority to the economic issue in such a crucial situation for the world, this region and our country.</s>
1020	This was my primary purpose for holding this meeting. I wanted to arrange a meeting in the month of Ramadan with those who are active in public and private economic sectors. I wanted to spend a few hours listening to them and I wanted the meeting to be reflected by our domestic media as a sign that the Islamic Republic should pay serious attention to the issue of economy, economic activities and economic progress and that the government and the people should cooperate and make efforts in this regard for reasons which I will speak about later on.

1021	This was the first purpose and it has already been fulfilled because the meeting will be reflected in the media.	To wannan shi ne lamari na farko; an kuma tabbatar da shi sannan kuma za a gabatar da abin da ya gudana a wannan taron.	<pad> That's the first thing; it's been confirmed and will be presented what happened at this meeting.</s>
1022	This is a message to everybody - including government officials in economic sectors, those who are active in economic sectors throughout the country and all our people. The message is that today we should pay serious attention to the issue of economy.

1023	The second purpose of this meeting - which has thankfully been fulfilled - was to get those who do not work for the government to present the people with a report about the realities in the country, the advances that have been made and the activities that are being carried out.	Lamari na biyu wanda shirya wannan taron ya sami damar samar da shi sannan kuma alhamdu lillahi haka lamarin ya ke, shi ne ba da dama ga wadanda ba jami'an gwamnati su gabatar da wani rahoto dangane da hakikanin yanayin kasar nan, ci gaban kasar nan, irin yunkurin da ake yi sannan kuma su isa zuwa ga kunnuwan mutane.	<pad> The second thing that the organizer of this conference has been able to provide and alhamdulilah it is, is to allow non-governmental organizations to present a report on the state of the country, the progress of the country, the efforts made and to get the people's attention.</s>
1024	No, everybody knows my opinion in this regard. I believe that we should see both the positive and the negative points. But I believe today the important point is that our people should know what outcomes their efforts, the efforts of our government officials and the enormous human capacities in the country have produced.	Ba wai ina cewa a ko da yaushe a kuma kullum a dinga fadin irin ci gaban da aka samu ba ne kawai; kowa dai ya san ra'ayi na; ni na yi imani da cewa wajibi ne a dinga fadin nasarorin da aka samu tare kuma da gazawar da ake da ita don a dinga kallonsu tare; to amma abin da a yau na ke ganin yake da muhimmanci, shi ne cewa mutanen wannan kasar su fahimci irin sakamakon da aka samu albarkacin himmarsu, himmar jami'an gwamnati da kuma albarkatu daban-daban da ake da su a kasar nan.	<pad> No, I am not against the always and everywhere telling of progress; everyone knows my opinion; I have always believed that it is necessary to tell of the successes and failures to see them together; but what I think is important today is that the people of this country understand the results achieved through their own efforts, the efforts of the government and the resources available in this country.</s>
1025	You should know that I am in contact with the people: they do not know about these advances.	Ina son in sanar da ku cewa; ni dai ina da alaka da mutane; mutane ba su da labara kan irin wadannan ci gaban da aka samu.	<pad> I want to tell you that; I have a relationship with people; people don't know about the progress that has been made.</s>
1026	The majority of the people do not know about what you said today about different areas. I took notes and by Allah's favor, a detailed report will be prepared.	Wadannan abubuwan da a halin yanzu kuka fadi da suka shafi bangarori daban-daban - wanda na rubuta su a takaice sannan kuma za a shirya rahoto kansu insha Allahu - lalle a mafi yawan lokuta mutane ba su da labarin hakan.	<pad> These things you have just said about different sectors - which I've summarized and will be prepared for a report - in most cases people don't know about them.</s>
1027	We see that great achievements are being made in the country and the honor belongs to the Iranian nation.	Ana ci gaba da gudanar da ayyuka masu girma a kasar nan, wannan wani abin alfahari ne ga al'ummar Iran.	<pad> The great works are continuing to be done in the country, which is a pride for the people of Iran.</s>
1028	It is the people who are doing these things.	Ci gaba ne na al'ummar Iran.	<pad> It's the progress of Iran's people.</s>
1029	We have made good advances in sectors related to production, services, agriculture, industry, knowledge-based industries and different other areas which were discussed in this meeting.	Mun sami ci gaba da kyau a bangaren samar da kayayyakin da ake bukata, a bangaren hidima, a bangaren aikin gona, a bangaren masana'antu da sauran bangarori na ilimi da sauransu da aka ambace su a nan.	<pad> We have made great progress in the supply of food, health, agriculture, industry and other sectors of education and others mentioned here.</s>
1030	It is good if people hear these things from individuals in charge of different sectors who are independent of the government. These things would make the people hopeful and happy.	Lalle lamari ne mai kyau mutane su ji hakan daga bakin jami'an bangarori daban-daban wadanda ba na gwamnati ba; hakan lamari ne da zai kara wa mutane karfin gwuiwa da kuma sanya su farin ciki.	<pad> It is very good for people to hear that from non-governmental officials; it will give people strength and make them happy.</s>
1031	All of us should pay attention to the point that one of the techniques that the enemies of the Iranian nation use in their psychological warfare is to spread despair among the people. I stress this point.	Yana da kyau dukkaninmu mu fahimci wannan lamarin na cewa a yau daya daga cikin hanyoyin yakin kwakwalwa na makiyan al'ummar Iran shi ne kashe wa mutane gwuiwa. Lalle ina kira da a lura da wannan lamarin sosai.	<pad> It is good for us all to understand that today one of the means of brain warfare used by the enemies of the people of Iran is killing the people. I urge us all to pay close attention to this matter.</s>
1032	The tone should not undermine the existing hope and determination.	Bai kamata abin da za a fadin ya zamanto mai kashe gwuiwa da kawar da fata da kuma himmar da ake da ita ba.	<pad> The words should not be demotivating and destroying hope and courage.</s>
1033	The tone should convey the feeling that, for example, forty percent of the job has been done and that the ground has been prepared for the other sixty percent to be done.	Lalle wajibi ne a ji cewa muna da wani ci gaban da muka samu, a matsayin misali (an sami ci gaba na) kashi arba'in cikin dari, sauran kashi sittin din kuma akwai hanyoyi da damar da za a iya cike shi.	<pad> We must really feel that we have made some progress, for example (we have made) forty percent, the rest of the sixty percent is still there and there are ways and opportunities to fill it up.</s>
1034	"One point is that I named this year ""The Year of Economic Jihad""."	Lamari na farko shi ne cewa mun sanya wa shekarar bana (shekarar 1390 hijira shamsiyya) sunan ‘Shekarar Kokarin Bunkasa Tattalin Arziki'.	<pad> The first thing is that we have named this year (1390 hijri shamsiyya) as the Year of Economic Development.</s>
1035	The policy of the arrogant powers is to defeat the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic by using the economy.	Siyasar ma'abota girman kai dai ita ce cutar da al'ummar Iran da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci a fagen tattalin arziki.	<pad> The imperialist policy is to harm the people of Iran and the Islamic Republic in economic terms.</s>
1036	Although the sanctions have been imposed on us under the pretext of the nuclear issue, they are lying. The nuclear issue is not the reason behind the sanctions.	Duk da cewa sun fake da batun makamashin nukiliya wajen sanya takunkumin tattalin arziki, to amma hakan karya ce; lamarin nukiliya ba shi ne dalilin sanya wadannan takunkumin ba.	<pad> Although they used the issue of nuclear energy to impose economic sanctions, it is false; the issue of nuclear energy was not the reason for these sanctions.</s>
1037	You may remember that the major sanctions which were initially imposed on our country happened at a time when there was no mention of nuclear energy in the country.	Mai yiyuwa ne kuna iya tunawa, a lokacin da suka sanya babban takunkumi (na farko) wanda kuma shi ne mafarin takunkumin da suka sanya wa kasar nan, a lokacin ma dai babu wata maganar nukiliya a kasar nan.	<pad> Maybe you can remember, when they imposed the first major sanctions, which was the first sanctions imposed on the country, there wasn't even a talk of nuclear in the country at that time.</s>
1038	"For example, the sanctions known as the ""D'Amato-Kennedy Bill"" - which were of course not very important and were proposed and followed up in the US Congress by somebody called D'Amato - were passed when the issue of nuclear energy was not even being discussed."	"Duk da cewa ba wani takunkumi ne mai muhimmanci ba, to amma dai har yanzu sunansa na nan, wato takunkumi ne da aka fi saninsa da sunan takunkumin ""D'Amato"" - wanda takunkumi ne da wani mutum ne mai wannan sunan da ya gabatar da shi a majalisar Amurka - wannan takunkumin dai na wani lokaci ne wanda a lokacin babu ma wata maganar nukiliya ma."	<pad> Although it was not a very important sanction, it still has its name, the D'Amato sanctions - which is a sanctions proposed by a man of that name in the United States Congress - were imposed at a time when there was no nuclear talk.</s>
1039	The goal of the sanctions that have been imposed on us is to cripple our economy.	Manufar takunkumin ita ce gurguntar da tattalin arzikin (kasar Iran).	<pad> The purpose of the sanctions is to cripple the economic (Iran)</s>
1040	Of course the Iranian nation has the honor of having tolerated these sanctions for 32 years.	To amma abin alfahari shi ne cewa shekaru talatin da biyu kenan al'ummar Iran suka jure wa wannan takunkumin.	<pad> But the proud thing is that for thirty-two years the people of Iran have endured this ban.</s>
1041	Of course the sanctions that have been imposed on us during the recent years have grown in number and variety. However, the growth is insignificant compared to the growth in the number and variety of constructive activities in the country. Thirty years ago when they started imposing sanctions on us, their sanctions were more likely to hurt us than the sanctions that they currently impose on us and they repeatedly promise that they will increase their sanctions.	Ko da ya ke a shekarun baya-bayan nan an fadada takunkumin, to amma sakamakon irin ci gaban ayyukan gina kasa daban-daban a kasar nan wadannan takunkumnin sun zamanto ba a bakin komai ba. Shekaru talatin kenan da fara sanya wadannan takunkumin, mai yiyuwa ne takunkumin (wancan lokacin) su fi cutar da mu a kan irin takunkumin da a halin yanzu ake sanya mana da kuma gudanar da su kamar yadda kuma suke ci gaba da alkawarin cewa za a kara su.	<pad> Although the sanctions have been widened in recent years, they have become less relevant. Thirty years after the introduction of these sanctions, it is possible that the sanctions (of that time) have been more damaging to us than the sanctions (current) are being imposed and executed on us as they continue to promise that they will be increased.</s>
1042	It is necessary to become familiar with the opposing camp. It is necessary to become familiar with the enemy's tools and weapons and to prepare weapons that would make his weapons ineffective.	A saboda haka wajibi ne a shirya masa. Wajibi ne a fahimci masu adawa da mu, a fahimci irin makami da kyayyakin aikin da suke amfani da su sannan kuma a shirya makaman fada da su.	<pad> For that reason, we must prepare for it. We must understand our enemies, understand the kinds of weapons and tools they use and prepare for battle with them.</s>
1043	This requires economic jihad.	Ko shakka babu hakan yana bukatar jihadi (kokari) na tattalin arziki.	<pad> No doubt, it requires both jihad (hard work) and economic growth.</s>
1044	Not all activities can be called jihad.	Ba kowani yunkuri ne ake kiransa da sunan jihadi ba.	<pad> No jihad is a name for any action.</s>
1045	Only certain kinds of activities with certain characteristics can be called jihad.	Wani yunkuri mai wasu siffofi ne ake kiransa da jihadi.	<pad> This type of movement is called jihad.</s>
1046	One of the main characteristics of jihad is being faced with an aggressive position.	Yunkurin fuskantar irin wannan kokari mai cike da manufa ta kiyayya, daya ne daga cikin sharadi na asali na jihadi.	<pad> The effort to confront such a full of hatred attempt is one of the fundamental requirements of jihad.</s>
1047	An activity with such characteristics can be called jihad.	Irin wannan yunkuri sunansa jihadi.	<pad> Such a movement is called jihad.</s>
1048	Therefore, economic jihad means the Iranian nation's persistent, comprehensive and purposeful movement with the intention of rendering the aggressive and spiteful efforts of the enemy ineffective.	A saboda haka jihadi na tattalin arziki yana nufin yunkuri da ake ci gaba da yinsa wanda kuma ya kame ko ina na al'ummar Iran da manufar kashe wutar kiyayyar makiya.	<pad> So economic jihad means an ongoing movement that has spread throughout the society of Iran with the purpose of extinguishing the hatred of the enemy.</s>
1049	The next point is that in the 20-Year Strategic Plan - which is an essential and high-level document for reference - our country is supposed to achieve the top position in the region in important and vital areas. We need to achieve this position.	Wani lamarin kuma na daban shi ne cewa a shirin ci gaban kasa - wanda wani shiri ne mai muhimmancin gaske na ciyar da kasa gaba - mun shirya wani tsari na ciyar da kasar nan gaba a bangarori masu muhimmanci na rayuwa da kai ta matsayi na daya; wajibi ne mu kai ga wannan matsayi na kolin.	<pad> One more thing is that in the National Development Plan - which is a very important plan for moving the country forward - we have established a system to move the country forward in important areas of life and to rank it first; we must get to this top position.</s>
1050	Naturally others will not stand by and watch us achieve the first position. They are working hard.	Na'am sauran al'ummomi ma ba za su zauna su zuba mana ido mu zama na farko ba; su ma suna nan suna ci gaba da yunkurinsu, suna ta kokarinsu.	<pad> Yes, the other nations will not sit and watch us become the first; they will continue their efforts, their effort.</s>
1051	We are witness to strenuous economic efforts by some of the regional countries in areas in which we want to become the top country. Of course we are not using some of the means that they are currently using and we will never do so.	Ko da ya ke mu din nan ba ma amfani da wasu hanyoyin da suke amfani da su, kuma ba za mu taba amfani da su ba; mu dai muna bin mafi tsarkin tafarki da kyawunsa ne; to amma mun yi amanna da cewa za a iya isa ga wannan mataki na farkon, matukar dai muka tsara irin saurin aikin da muke yi.	<pad> Although we do not use the methods they use, and will never use them; we are following the most clean path and its simplicity; but we believe that this first stage can be achieved, if we plan our speed of work.</s>
1052	Therefore, this requires jihad.	A saboda haka wannan lamarin yana bukatar jihadi (kokari).	<pad> So this matter needs jihad.</s>
1053	We need both speed and prudence so that we can achieve the first position.	Wajibi ne wannan kokarin ya zamanto mai karfi sannan kuma ya zamanto akwai tunani a cikinsa don mu sami damar isa ga wannan matsayi na farko.	<pad> This effort must be strong and focused to allow us to achieve this first position.</s>
1054	Becoming the top country in the region is not just a whim. No, we want to become the top country because the destiny of our nation depends on it.	Wannan batu na isa ga matsayi na farko ba wai wani yayi ne ba na cewa mu din nan za mu kai ga matsayi na farko ba; a'a, saboda cewa makomar al'ummomi a yau ta dogara ne da wannan lamarin.	<pad> The matter of being first is not a promise that we will be first; no, but because the future of society today depends on this.</s>
1055	If a country fails to fulfill its needs and make progress in the area of economy, knowledge and infrastructure that are necessary for progress, it will be oppressed in a merciless way.	Idan har wata kasa a fagen tattalin arziki, a bangaren ilimi, a bangaren abubuwan ci gaban kasa ba ta iya tabbatar da abin da take bukata da kuma samun ci gaba ba, to kuwa cikin rashin tausayi za a ci gaba da zaluntarta.	<pad> If a country cannot meet its demands and progress in the field of economic, education, and development, then it will be unbearably exploited.</s>
1056	We do not want to be oppressed.	Mu dai ba ma son a zalunce mu.	<pad> I'm sorry for the abuse.</s>
1057	Our country has been subjected to oppression and transgression for two hundred years.	Shekaru dari biyu kenan kasar mu take fuskantar cutarwa da zalunci.	<pad> For two hundred years our country has been suffering from oppression and violence.</s>
1058	This oppression was the result of the weakness of incompetent, corrupt and materialistic monarchies and the dynamism that their enemies enjoyed.	Raunin hukumar sarakuna maras dacewa mai son duniya da kuma irin makircin da makiya suke aikatawa shi ne dalilin faruwar wannan zaluncin.	<pad> The weakness of the unjust government of the king and the conspiracy of the enemies is the reason for this injustice.</s>
1059	The English first infiltrated and interfered in the political system of our country in the year 1800. They recruited supporters for themselves. And certain other European countries accompanied them and did the same things.	Tun daga shekarar 1800 ne a karon farko turawa Ingila suka kutso cikin cibiyoyin siyasa na kasar nan da tsoma bakinsu, haka su din nan da na kurkusa da su na daga sauran kasashen turai suka ci gaba da hakan na tsawon wancan lokacin.	<pad> From the 1800s, Englishmen started to meddle in the country's politics and economy, and they and their allies from other European countries continued to do so for the rest of that time.</s>
1060	In the year 1800 when the first English ambassador entered our country, he started to bribe people and buy supporters as soon as he got off the ship in the city of Bushehr. The ambassador was coming from India. It was when the English had the Indian government under control.	Shekarar 1800 ne jakadan Ingila na farko ya shigo kasar nan - wanda ya zo ne daga Indiya; wato a wancan lokacin da hukumar Indiya take hannun turawan Ingila sannan kuma cibiyar sarauta tana can ne - daga wannan garin na Bushehr lokacin da ya sauka daga jirgin ruwa, ya fara ba da cin hanci da sayen mutane, cikin sauki kuwa ya sami damar sayen wasu mutanen.	<pad> In 1800 the first English ambassador came to the country - who came from India; which is when the government of India was in the hands of the English colonisers and the center of power was there - from this town of Bushehr, when he landed on the ship, he began to give bribes and buy people, and he managed to buy some people very easily.</s>
1061	All those princes, emirs and other people with such impressive-sounding titles gave in to the presents of the ambassador. The process of oppression by the enemies started from that day. Our weak statesmen let the enemy infiltrate the country on that day.	Dukkanin wadannan ‘ya'yan sarki da sarakuna da sauransu, nan da nan suka mika kai ga wannan mutumin. Makircin makiya da kafar ungulunsu daga nan ya faro a wannan kasar. Wadannan sarakuna na wancan lokaci marasa lamiri sun bar makiya suka sami bakin magana da kutsawa cikin wannan kasar.	<pad> All these sons of the king and the kings and others, immediately bowed down to this man. Then began the evil and the wickedness of this country. Those kings of that time, without heart, let the enemies have the right to speak and enter this country.</s>
1062	We do not want this process to continue.	To mu dai ba ma son hakan ta ci gaba da wanzuwa.	<pad> We don't want it to continue.</s>
1063	The Revolution has presented them with an insurmountable obstacle.	Juyin juya halin Musulunci ya samar da wata garkuwa ta karfe a gabansu.	<pad> The Islamic Revolution has created a steel shield in front of them.</s>
1064	We want to strengthen this obstacle.	Muna son wannan garkuwar ta kara karfi ne.	<pad> We want this fence to be stronger.</s>
1065	We must not at all allow them to interfere in our economy, culture, politics and destiny.	Bai kamata mu bar su ta kowace hanya su zamanto masu tsoma baki cikin tattalin arzikinmu, cikin al'adunmu, cikin siyasar mu da kuma makomarmu da albarkatun kasar mu ba.	<pad> We should not allow them to meddle in our economy, culture, politics and our future and resources.</s>
1066	Economy is one of the important pillars of this domestic strength.	Daya daga cikin tushen wannan karfi na cikin gida shi ne tattalin arziki.	<pad> One of the sources of this internal strength is economic.</s>
1067	This is why we say we must become the top country in the region.	Wannan shi ne dalilin da ya sa muke cewa wajbi ne mu zamanto a matsayi na farko.	<pad> That's why we say that it is our duty to be the first.</s>
1068	It is not just a whim. No, the destiny of our nation depends on it.	Ba wai cewa wani yayi ne na cewa dole ne Iran ta zamanto ta farko a wannan yankin ba; a'a saboda makomar wannan al'umma ta ta'allaka ne da hakan.	<pad> No one is telling Iran to be the first in this region; no, it's because the future of this nation depends on it.</s>
1069	Therefore, persistent, clever, sincere and effective efforts - which utilize all capacities of the country - play a role in this regard.	A saboda haka wajibi ne a dinga gudanar da ayyuka da kuma kokari ba kama hannun yaro cikin tsarkin zuciya da kuma yin tasiri, wanda wajibi ne a yi amfani da dukkanin karfi da fagagen da ake da su a wannan kasar.	<pad> For this reason, it is necessary to carry out all the work and efforts with sincerity and effect, which requires the use of all the powers and resources available in this country.</s>
1070	This was what I had heard and I saw it for myself after the Revolution and the resultant advances in the country.	Mun ji hakan; sannan kuma muna ganin hakan cikin irin ci gaban da kasar nan ta samu a lokacin juyin juya halin Musulunci.	<pad> We heard it; and we see it in the development that the country has had during the Islamic Revolution.</s>
1071	Before the Revolution, nobody would have believed the progress that has been made in the country in the area of building dams.	Abin da ya faru a fagen madatsan ruwa a kasar nan, kafin nasarar juyin juya halin Musulunci babu wani da zai yarda cewa hakan za ta faru.	<pad> What happened in the water sector of the country, before the Islamic Revolution no one would have thought that would happen.</s>
1072	The gentleman who spoke in this meeting referred to building dams as an example, but the same is true of many other areas. There was a day when it was impossible to convince people that such scientific progress would be made in the country. Today we can see these advances in front of our eyes.	An kafa misali ne da madatsan ruwa amma a bangarori daban-daban ma haka lamarin ya ke. Abubuwan da a halin yanzu suke faruwa na irin ci gaban da ake samu a kasar nan, a wani lokaci a baya (ko shakka babu) babu wani da ya yarda cewa za su faru, to amma a yau ga shi nan muna ganinsu suna faruwa a gaban idanuwanmu.	<pad> The water supply is just one example, but it's the same in other areas. Things that are currently happening in the country, at a time in the past (of course) nobody believed they would happen, but now we see them happening in front of our eyes.</s>
1073	I have realized through experience that there is nothing that our youth are incapable of doing when the necessary infrastructure has been prepared. Any thing for which the necessary infrastructure has been prepared can be done by our youth. We enjoy such human resources in the country.	Ina fadin hakan ne sakamakon irin masaniyar da nake da ita dangane da bangarori daban daban na kasar nan, ta yadda babu wani bangare a kasar nan da matasanmu ba za su iya bayyanar da kansu a wajen da kuma ciyar da shi gaba ba matukar dai an share musu fage.	<pad> I say this because of my knowledge of different parts of the country, that there is no part of the country that our young people cannot be present and support it if they are given the opportunity to do so.</s>
1074	This is a very important point.	Wannan lamari ne mai muhimmanci.	<pad> This is a very important matter.</s>
1075	Our economic potential is also very important.	Irin karfi na tattalin arziki da mu ke da shi ma lamari ne mai muhimmanci.	<pad> The strength of our economic capacity is also an important issue.</s>
1076	Once I said that considering the proportion of our population to the population of the world, we enjoy a disproportionately large number of vital mines and natural resources.	A wani lokaci a baya na taba fadin cewa idan aka kwatanta yanayin albarkatun kasar da mu ke da su da irin yawan al'ummar mu da kuma al'ummar duniya, za a ga cewa sun dara hakan.	<pad> I have once said that if you compare our resources to the number of our people and the world's population, you will find that they are much better.</s>
1077	Similarly the area of our country is around one percent of the total land area of our planet. Well, we should have one percent of the total essential natural resources, but in certain cases we have 3, 4 or 5 percent of the total resources.	Yawan mutanen kasar nan kimanin kashi daya cikin dari na mutanen duniya ne, kamar yadda fadin kasar mu kimanin kashi daya cikin dari na dukknain fadin duniya ne - to a saboda haka abin da ya zama wajibi shi ne mu sami kashi daya cikin dari na albarkatun kasa na duniya; to amma a wasu wajajen ma abin da muke da shi din ya kai kashi 3, kashi 4 da kashi 5.	<pad> The population of our country is about one percent of the world's population, and the area of our country is about one percent of the total area of the world - so it is necessary for us to have one percent of the world's natural resources; but in some areas we have 3, 4, and even 5 percent of the world's natural resources;</s>
1078	These are important capacities and they are very valuable.	Wadannan wasu fagage ne masu muhimmanci sannan kuma lamurra ne masu kimar gaske.	<pad> These are important fields and the results are very valuable.</s>
1079	The shortage of water in the country that has been rightly pointed out can be fully addressed with clever scientific and technological plans. Some of the friends who spoke in this meeting mentioned this point and I have made the same point previously. With a little care and progress, we can compensate for the shortcoming that we are suffering from.	Shi kansa wannan lamari na karancin ruwan da yanzu ake maganarsa a kasar nan kuma haka lamarin yake - mu dai kasa ce da take da karancin ruwa - to amma ana iya magance wannan matsalar ta hanyar gabatar da tsare-tsare na ilimi da suka dace, wanda wasu daga cikin ‘yan'uwa ma sun yi ishara da hakan a nan, a baya ma dai na fadi hakan.

By doing some other activities, we can fill in these shortages that we have.</s>
1080	Therefore, our country has genuinely extraordinary capacities in terms of natural resources.	A saboda haka a hakikanin gaskiya kasar nan tana da albarkatun kasa masu yawan gaske.	<pad> So in reality the country has a lot of natural resources.</s>
1081	The same is true of our geographical position.	Haka lamarin ya ke a bangaren wajen da muke da kuma wannan yankin.	<pad> That's the case with our area and this other one.</s>
1082	We are connected to two different seas.	Muna wani waje ne mai muhimmancin gaske.	<pad> We are a very important place.</s>
1083	We are connected to international waters and the sensitive region that lies between the east and the west - namely, Asia and Europe. We are located in one of the most important spots of this sensitive region. The two seas provide us access to the west and the east.	Makwabtakar da muke da ita da tekuna guda biyu da kuma alaka da yanki mai tsananin muhimmanci tsakanin gabashi da yammaci, wato tsakanin Asiya da Turai, muna wani bangare ne mai muhimmanci na wannan yankin, hakan ya samar mana da damar haduwa da yammaci da kuma gabashi.	<pad> Our neighbourhood of two seas and our connection with the very important region between east and west, that is between Asia and Europe, make us a key part of this region, allowing us to connect with both the west and the east.</s>
1084	These are all advantages that we enjoy.	Dukkanin wadannan wasu abubuwa ne masu kyau a gare mu.	<pad> All these things are good things for us.</s>
1085	As was mentioned, one fourth of the time for the 20-Year Strategic Plan has passed.	A halin yanzu dai - kamar yadda aka yi ishara da hakan - mun ci kashi daya cikin hudu cikin shekarun shirin ci gaban kasa na shekaru ashirin da aka tsara.	<pad> Nowadays, as mentioned above, we have achieved one-fourth of the twenty-year development plan of the country.</s>
1086	One four-year plan - namely, the fourth development plan - is over. This year is the first year of the fifth development plan.	Wato wani shiri na shekaru hudu da aka tsara ya riga da ya kare; shekarar bana mafari ne na shiri na biyar.	<pad> Each of the four-year plans has already been completed; this year marks the start of the fifth plan.</s>
1087	Of course many things were done during the fourth development plan.	Tabbas an gudanar da ayyuka masu yawa a cikin shiri na shekaru hudun.	<pad> However, there have been many activities in the four-year program.</s>
1088	According to the accurate reports that were presented in this meeting, very important things have been done. But there are certain other things that have not been done yet.	Kamar yadda rahoton da suka gabatar wanda kuma kun saurare shi kuma haka lamarin ya ke an gudanar da ayyuka masu muhimmancin gaske; to amma duk da haka akwai wadansu ayyukan da ba a gudanar da su ba wadanda kuma wajibi ne a yi su.	<pad> As they have reported and you have heard, there have been important works done; however, there are still some things that haven't been done that are necessary to do.</s>
1089	The policies that have been announced regarding reforming the norms of consumption, the general policies of our bureaucratic system, the general employment policies and the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution - all these policies are in harmony.	Siyasar da aka sanar a fagen gyara irin yadda ake amfani da albarkatun kasa, siyasa ta gaba daya ta tsarin nan, siyasa ta gaba daya ta samar da aikin yi da kuma siyasar doka ta 44 - wadanda aka sanar da su - dukkaninsu tsare-tsare ne da suka yi daidai da junansu.	<pad> The announced policy on resource allocation, the overall system policy, the overall employment policy and the 44th Amendment policy are all policies that are interrelated.</s>
1090	If we manage to formulate and implement the plan on the basis of these policies, we will manage to make far better use of the capacities that I spoke about.	Idan har muka iya gudanar da wadannan tsare-tsare kamar yadda aka tsara, to kuwa za mu iya amfanuwa da irin wadannan dama da albarkatu da ake da su wadanda aka yi ishara da su.	<pad> If we can carry out these measures as planned, then we can benefit from the opportunities and blessings mentioned above.</s>
1091	These policies create a kind of cohesion and this cohesion between different layers ensures economic dynamism.	Wadannan siyasa za su iya samar da wani hadin kai da kuma tabbatar da yunkuri na tattalin arziki.	<pad> These policies can create a coalition and ensure economic growth.</s>
1092	Of course some of the goals that had been specified in the fourth development plan were not achieved. Many factors were involved: both domestic and international issues were involved.	Ko da yake ba a cimma wadansu daga cikin manufofin da aka tsara su cikin tsari na shekaru hudun ba, akwai dalilai daban-daban da suka hana cimma hakan; da suka hada da lamurra na cikin gida da kuma wasu na waje.	<pad> Although some of the objectives set out in the four-year plan were not achieved, there were a variety of reasons that prevented it; including internal and external obstacles.</s>
1093	Among the goals that have not been achieved are the 8 percent growth, reducing unemployment, the percentage of investment that had been specified and the issue of reducing inflation which I spoke about previously.	Batutuwa irin su samun ci gaba na kashi 8 cikin dari, ko kuma rage rashin aikin yi ko kuma kashin da aka tsara na zuba jari ko kuma lamarin rage irin tsadar kayayyaki - wanda a wancan ranar na yi ishara da hakan - dukkanin wadannan abubuwa ne da ba a cimma su ba.	<pad> Examples of growth of 8 percent, or reducing unemployment, or the target for investment, or the issue of lowering prices - which I mentioned yesterday - all these things are not achieved.</s>
1094	We need to intensify our labor so that we can compensate for the past shortcomings.	Hakan lamari ne da ke wajabta mana kara kokarin a cikin wannan shiri na shekaru biyar don mu sami damar cike irin gibin da ake da su a baya.	<pad> That is why we have to work harder in this five-year plan to fill the gaps that have been left behind.</s>
1095	According to Article 44 of the Constitution, we had to limit the ownership and economic activities of the government and we did so. What was the goal?	A bisa abin da aka fadi cikin wannan dokar, wajibi ne mu sake nazari a fagen mallaka ta gwamnati da ayyukan tattalin arziki na gwamnati, an gudanar da hakan.	<pad> According to this law, it was necessary to review the state property and economic activities of the state, and it was done.</s>
1096	The goal was to create a competitive economy with the presence of the private sector and its investments in the economy of the country.	Da wata manufa? Da manufar samar da wani tattalin arziki da ke cike da gasa ta hanyar shigo da ‘yan kasuwa da masu zuba jari a fagen tattalin arziki.	<pad> With another purpose? To create a highly competitive economy by bringing in businessmen and investors into the economic sector.</s>
1097	According to calculations, the amount of money that is required for investment over this five-year period is around 160 billion dollars.	Sun yi lissafi sun gano cewa kudaden da ake bukata wajen zuba jari cikin wadannan shekaru biyar din, a kowace shekara ya kai kimani dala biliyan 160.	<pad> They calculated and found that the total investment required for the next five years, each year, would be about 160 billion dollars.</s>
1098	And this is something that must be done.	Wajibi ne a samar da hakan.	<pad> It must be provided.</s>
1099	Good things have been done regarding the implementation of the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution, but what has been done so far is not enough. It is necessary to improve our performance. It is not just a matter of privatizing economic enterprises and leaving the arena.	A fagen gudanar da siyasar doka ta 44 an gudanar da ayyuka masu kyau to amma dai ba su wadatar ba; wajibi ne a kara kaimi.

1100	Healthy activities are always accompanied by unhealthy activities.	A ko da yaushe a tattare da ayyuka masu kyau, akwai wadansu ayyukan kuma marasa kyau.	<pad> It's always filled with good things, and there are also some bad things.</s>
1101	I have been stressing the issue of economic corruption for several years.	Shekara da shekaru kenan na ke ta magana kan batun fada da masu ta'annuti ga tattalin arziki.	<pad> For years I've been talking about the fight against economic opponents.</s>
1102	When I first pointed out the issue, a number of people came to me and said that because I was stressing the issue of economic corruption, our investors might be frightened to enter economic activities.	A lokacin da na gabatar da wannan lamarin, wadansu su kan zo wajena su ce wadannan maganganu da kake yawan yi kan batun ta'annuti ga tattalin arziki zai tsoratar da ‘yan kasuwa wajen shigowa fagen tattalin arziki.	<pad> When I presented this matter, some people would come to me and say that your frequent statements about the economic inequality will discourage businessmen from entering the economic field.</s>
1103	I told them that my comments would have the opposite effect and that investors would be encouraged to engage in economic activities.	Ni dai na ce musu sabanin (abin da kuke fadin), hakan lamari ne da zai kwadaitar da su shigowa.	<pad> I told them the opposite (what you are saying), that it was a way to make them want to come in.</s>
1104	If an investor who wants to engage in a lawful and honorable business knows that the government will prosecute those who violate the law, he will be encouraged more.	Duk wani dan kasuwan da yake son samun abinci na halal sannan kuma yake son gudanar da ayyuka na halal wadanda shari'a ta amince da su, idan ya fahimci cewa gwamnati ba za ta yi sassauci ga masu karya doka ba, hakan lamari ne da zai karfafa masa gwuiwa.	<pad> Every businessman who wants to get halal food and wants to do halal business that the sharia recognizes, if he understands that the government will not be lenient to those who violate the law, it will strengthen him.</s>
1105	We are opposed to those who give rise to corruption and those who abuse their position. An investor who helps the country through his presence, his ideas, his money, his investments and his entrepreneurial activities, should be encouraged and praised. Therefore, fighting economic corruption is an essential principle in this regard and it is necessary to observe this principle.	Mu dai muna adawa da masu satan kudaden gwamnati ne, haka nan kuma da masu samar da hanyoyin yin hakan, haka nan ma ga masu mummunan amfani da damar da suka samu.

A saboda haka fada da ta'annuti ga tattalin arziki, ko shakka babu wani rukuni ne na asasi da wajibi ne a aiwatar da shi.	<pad> We are against the thieves of public money, as well as the ones who provide the means for this, and against the ones who misuse their power. We must strengthen the spirit of the businessman who helps the country with his mind, his money, his investment and his work. Therefore, the fight against economic terrorism is undoubtedly a fundamental component that must be implemented.</s>
1106	Fortunately all or most of our ministers and government officials in charge of economic activities are present in this meeting.	Abin farin cikin shi ne cewa dukkanin ko kuma mafi yawa daga cikin ministocin tattalin arziki da jami'an gwamnati na bangarorin tattalin arziki suna nan a wannan wajen.	<pad> The good news is that all or most of the economic ministers and officials of the economic department are here in this room.</s>
1107	Well, you heard the comments of those who spoke in this meeting: both the comments about your strengths and the suggestions which were indicative of the existence of certain shortcomings. I hereby ask our government officials to carefully think about the comments they heard today.	To sun ji abubuwan da wadanda suka yi magana suka fadi; wato shin bangarorin da suka yi magana kan ababe masu kyau da aka aikata ne ko kuma irin shawarwarin da suka fadi wadanda suke nuni da irin nakasin da ake da su.

I urge you to pay close attention to what you have heard, and to think and reflect on it.</s>
1108	We must not let comments be made and then do nothing.	Kada mu bari abubuwan da aka fadin su kare a nan.	<pad> Don't let the debate end here.</s>
1109	Mr. Tavakkoli complained that you did not mention the negative points. I would disagree with him because when you suggest that a certain thing should be done, it means that it has not been done yet and this shows that there are certain shortcomings and problems.	Na'am duk da cewa Malam Tawakkuli ya yi kukan cewa me ya sa ba a fadin abubuwa marasa kyau da ake da su; me ya sa (an fadi mana) a lokacin da aka gabatar da shawarwarin cewa wajibi ne a gudanar da kaza, hakan yana nufin cewa ba a gudanar da shi ba ne; wanda hakan yana nuni ne da wasu daga cikin nakasi da matsalolin da ake da su ne.	<pad> No, though the Imam Tawakkul complained that why isn't mentioned the bad things; why is it said that when the recommendations are made that something should be done, it means that it isn't done; which shows some of the flaws and problems that exist.</s>
1110	He should only pay careful attention to the suggestions which were made in this meeting and I believe they were good suggestions that deserve investigation. There are many things that remain to be said in this regard. I will only make a few recommendations.	Idan har aka lura da wadannan shawararwari, lalle a ra'ayina wadannan shawarwari ne masu kyau wadanda za a iya yin nazari da tuntuni kansu. Akwai abubuwan fadi da yawa a wannan bangaren, zan yi ishara ne da wadansu abubuwa guda biyu zuwa uku; daya daga cikin su kira ne ga cibiyoyin gwamnati da abin ya shafa, daya bangaren kuma na gaba daya ne.	<pad> If these suggestions are considered, I think they are good suggestions that can be considered and acted upon. There are many things to say in this regard, I will only refer to two or three; one of them is a call to the relevant government authorities, the other is a general appeal.</s>
1111	The first recommendation is about full implementation of the policies that have been formulated to support the production sector. Production is the basis of economy.	Na farko, batun gudanar da siyasar taimakawa bangaren da ke samar da kayayyakin da ake bukata ne. Samar da kayayyaki shi ne asasin tattalin arziki; tushen tattalin arziki na kasa ne.	<pad> First, the purpose of a policy is to help the sector that provides the necessities. Production is the basis of economic activity; it is the source of economic activity in a country.</s>
1112	Production is the main pillar of our economy. Regarding the subsidy redistribution plan and the enormous efforts that the government is making in this area, attention should be paid to supporting the production sector, just as it has been pointed out in the law - namely, the 30 percent that has been specified.	Dangane da batun manufantar da irin rangwamin da gwamnati ta ke bayarwa cikin kayayyakin bukatu na yau da kullum da kuma ayyukan da ta faro su a wannan fagen, lalle wajibi ne a lura da irin goyon bayan da za a ba wa bangaren samar da abubuwan da ake bukata; kamar yadda ya zo cikin doka: wato wannan kashi 30 cikin dari din da aka ayyana.	<pad> In order to ensure the efficiency of government subsidies and the work it has done in this field, it is necessary to take into account the support for the provision of necessities; as stated in the law: that is, the 30 percent provided by the law.</s>
1113	Of course some government officials who spoke with me believe that this 30 percent is not really needed.	Ko da yake wasu daga cikin jami'an gwamnati da muka yi magana da su, sun yi amanna da cewa babu bukatar wannan kashi 30 cikin darin.	<pad> Although some of the government officials we talked to agreed that there was no need for this 30 percent.</s>
1114	Certain sectors may not need government support, but in any case production requires support from the government. The production sector should receive its share of support.	Mai yiyuwa ne lamarin ya zamanto haka a wasu bangarorin, to amma dai ala kulli hal bangaren samar da kayyaki yana bukatar goyon bayan cibiyoyin gwamnati.	<pad> It may be true in other areas, but in any case the production sector needs the support of government agencies.</s>
1115	We have certain enterprises that are directly or indirectly hurt by these sanctions and it is necessary to take this point into consideration.	Akwai bangarorin da ko dai kai tsaye ko kuma ta wata hanyar wannan takunkumi ya cutar da su, don haka wajibi ne mu amfana da hakan.	<pad> There are sectors that have been directly or indirectly affected by this sanction, so it is our duty to take advantage of it.</s>
1116	Of course the private sector has certain obligations to fulfill in this regard: economizing on energy consumption, increasing productivity and using new machinery.	To amma tabbas bangaren ‘yan kasuwan ma yana da wani nauyi a wuyansa a wannan bangaren: (da suka hada da) tsumulmula wajen amfani da makamashi, kara matsayin amfani da kuma sabunta injunan da ake da su.	<pad> But the business sector has a responsibility in this regard: (including) energy conservation, improved use and modernization of existing engines.</s>
1117	Certain government officials complained to me that owners of certain industries are not interested in replacing their old machinery, which produce low output and consume a lot of energy. They complained that even if these people are provided with financial assistance, they will not use it to replace their old machinery with new machinery.	Wasu daga cikin jami'an gwamnati sun kawo min kukan cewa wasu daga cikin masu kamfanonin ba su yi wani abin a zo a gani wajen sabunta irin injunan da suke da su wadanda sun tsufa kuma suna amfani da makamashi sosai; idan har aka ba su rangwamin (da gwamnati take bayarwa din), ba za su yi amfani da shi ba.	<pad> Some government officials complained to me that some companies did not do enough to upgrade their old and energy-consuming machines; if they were offered the subsidies (the government's subsidies), they would not use them.</s>
1118	It is necessary to pay attention to this point.	To wajibi ne a lura da wannan lamarin.	<pad> It is necessary to take care of this matter.</s>
1119	Needless to say, government supervision is very important in this regard. That is to say, the government should provide support and it should also supervise the companies that it supports.	Ko da yake sanya idon gwamnati a wannan fagen ma lamari ne mai muhimmanci; wato a gefen irin wadannan taimako da gwamnati take bayarwa, wajibi ne kuma a sanya ido.	<pad> However, government monitoring in this field is also important; that is, besides the government's support for such activities, it is also necessary to monitor them.</s>
1120	The production sector should be provided with as much financial assistance as has been specified in the law, but care should be taken not to allow the people I spoke about - namely, opportunistic people - to use government's financial assistance for other purposes. I have received reports that different kinds of such diversions have happened in the country.	A ba da irin rangwamin da ya kamata a bayar; to amma kuma a sanya ido a kan irin wadannan mutanen da na yi ishara da su - wato masu mummunan amfani da damar da aka ba su - wajen ganin ba su yi amfani da shi din wajen wani aikin na daban ba, wanda hakan yana faruwa kuma muna da labarin hakan bisa rahotanin da aka fitar.	<pad> He has given the kind of discount that he should have given; but he also has to watch out for the people I mentioned - the misuse of the opportunity - to see that they don't use it for another purpose, which is what happens and we know it from the report.</s>
1121	It is necessary to deal with such things in a decisive way so that honest producers who are interested in hard work and production can fulfill their responsibilities.	Wajibi ne a fuskanci wannan lamari da dukkan karfi don masu kamfanoni na gaskiya masu tsarkin zuciya da son yin aiki su sami damar gudanar da ayyukansu.	<pad> It is necessary to address this issue with all the forces available to allow honest, sincere and ambitious businessmen to run their business.</s>
1122	The next point is the issue of imports which was briefly mentioned in this meeting and which I have discussed on many occasions with government officials in charge of imports.	Batu na gaba shi ne batun shigo da kayayyaki; wanda a nan ma an yi ishara da hakan, sannan kuma a lokuta da dama na sha magana da jami'ai kan wannan batu na shigo da kayayyaki.	<pad> The next issue is the importation of goods; which has been mentioned here, and I have often talked with officials about the importation of goods.</s>
1123	Of course nobody is opposed to importing, but it is necessary to regulate and to control imports.	Babu wani wanda yake adawa da shigo da kayayyaki; to amma wajibi ne a tsara yanayin shigo da kayayyakin, a sanya ido kansu.	<pad> No one is against imports; but it is necessary to plan the conditions of imports, to supervise them.</s>
1124	Just because we want certain goods to be available on the market on certain occasions - for example, during Norouz - is not a good justification for increasing imports.	Mujarradin saboda kada mu bari a sami wani lokaci - a matsayin misali ranakun kusa da idi - ya zamanto an rasa wani kaya a kasuwa, ba dalili ne mai girma da zai sanya mu kara irin mizanin kayayyakin da muke shigowa da su ba.	<pad> Although we have not allowed for a time - for example the days around Eid - to lose some goods in the market, it is not a big reason to increase the volume of goods that we import.</s>
1125	It is necessary to pay attention to domestic production when making decisions about imports.	Wajibi ne a lura da abubuwan da ake samarwa a cikin gida.	<pad> It is necessary to monitor the production of domestic products.</s>
1126	Of course it is said that imports contribute to competitiveness of domestic production. It is argued that in the absence of imports, domestic producers would not pay attention to the quality or final price of their products.	Ko da yake an fadi cewa shigowa da kaya zai taimaka wa abubuwan da ake samarwa na cikin gida; idan har ba a shigo da kayayyaki daga waje ba masu samar da kayayyaki na cikin gida ba za su ba da muhimmanci ga kyaun kayayyaki da kuma farashin kayan ba; wato shigo da kaya daga waje zai tilasta musu yin hakan.	<pad> Although it has been said that imports will help domestic production; without imports, the domestic producers would not be able to pay attention to quality and price; that is, imports will force them to do so.</s>
1127	I believe the logic behind this argument is not strong.	Ni dai a ra'ayina wannan ba dalili ne mai karfi ba.	<pad> In my opinion, this is not a strong reason.</s>
1128	Regarding the issue of imports, I would like to draw special attention to the agricultural sector. I believe importing agricultural products requires a far stronger justification than is currently presented.	Dangane da lamarin shigo da kayayyaki musamman ma kan kayayyakin gona. A ra'ayina batun shigo da kayayyakin aikin gona daga waje lamari ne da ke bukatar karfaffen dalili sama da abin da a yau mutum yake gani kafin a yarda da shi.	<pad> In regards to importing goods, especially farm products. In my opinion the issue of importing farm products from abroad needs a stronger argument than what one is seeing today before it can be accepted.</s>
1129	In the agricultural sector we produce outstanding products.	A bangaren aikin gona dai muna da kayayyaki masu kyaun gaske.	<pad> In the agricultural department, we have very good quality materials.</s>
1130	One of the gentlemen presented a report about our produce.	Daya daga cikin malamai ya gabatar da wani rahoto kan amfanin gona na lambu (‘ya'yan itatuwa) da ake samarwa.	<pad> One of the teachers presented a report on the production of garden fruits.</s>
1131	In the area of produce, our country is among the best in the world in terms of quality.	Kasar mu dai a wannan bangaren tana daga cikin kasashe na gaba gaba na duniya.	<pad> Our country is one of the leading countries in the world.</s>
1132	We should be able to increase our products.	Wajibi ne mu kara irin abubuwan da muke samarwa.	<pad> We have to increase the quality of our products.</s>
1133	We should export these garden and farm products so that the world understands what is going on in Iran and we must not import the same products with far worse quality from Latin America or other places.	Mu dinga fitar da wadannan kayayyaki na gona da lambuna don duniya ta dinga ganin abubuwan da ake da su a Iran; ba wai mu dinga shigo da irin wadannan kayayyaki daga a matsayin misali kasashen Latin Amurka da nan da can wadanda kayayyaki ne da ba su kai irin wadanda muke da su a nan ba.	<pad> We should export these farm and garden products to show the world what we have in Iran; not import these products from for example Latin America and so on, which are products that are not as good as what we have here.</s>
1134	The next point is related to the issue of exports.	Batu na gaba shi ne batun fitar da kayayyaki zuwa waje.	<pad> The next issue is the export of goods.</s>
1135	Of course the government has a duty to support exports and exporters.	Tabbas gwamnati tana da nauyi a wuyanta na ta taimaka wa masu fitar da kayayyakin.	<pad> However, the government has a duty to support exporters.</s>
1136	As one of the gentlemen reported, fortunately there has been a very good growth in non-oil exports and we will have a faster growth in the future. We expect non-oil exports to grow appropriately so that our exports become more than our imports.	Abin farin cikin - kamar yadda daya daga cikin ‘yan'uwa ya yi ishara da hakan - shi ne cewa kayayyakin da muke fitarwa wadanda ba man fetur ba sun samu karuwa da kuma ci gaba; a nan gaba ma za su kara samun ci gaban; a nan gaba muna da fatan cewa za mu sami ci gaban da ake bukata ta yadda mizanin abubuwan da muke fitarwa da wadanda muke shigo da su za su zamanto masu amfanarwa.	<pad> The good news - as one of the brothers indicated - is that our non-oil export has grown and will continue to grow; we hope that in the future we will have the necessary development so that the ratio of our export and import will be profitable.</s>
1137	This is the point we should reach and we should be independent of oil revenues.	Kamata ya yi mu kai matsayin da za mu iya wadatuwa da kudaden shiga da ake samunsu ta hanyar man fetur.	<pad> We must reach the point where we can be independent of our oil revenues.</s>
1138	Dependence on oil revenues is one of the most important economic woes of our country and it has not just plagued our economy: it has been a general problem.	Daya daga cikin manyan bala'oin da suke fuskantar bangaren tattalin arzikin mu da kuma dukkanin arzikin kasar nan na gaba daya, shi ne dogaro da kudaden shigar da ake samunsu ta hanyar man fetur.	<pad> One of the major challenges facing our economic sector and the whole of the country's economy is the dependence on the inflows from oil.</s>
1139	We must reach a point where we can stop our exports due to political or economic considerations for a period of 15 days or one month if we decide to do so. I made this point several years ago, but at that time our government officials did not welcome my suggestion.	A shekarun da suka gabata na fadi - ko da ya ke a wancan lokacin jami'an gwamnatin ba su na'am da hakan ba - wajibi ne mu kai ga matsayin da idan har a wata rana saboda lamurra na siyasa da kuma tattalin arziki na duniya mu ka yanke shawarar dakatar da sayar da man fetur din mu a matsayin misali na kwanaki sha biyar ko kuma wata guda, za mu iya yin haka.	<pad> In the past years I have said - although at that time government officials did not agree with it - that we must be able to reach a point where we can stop our oil sales for 15 days or a month, for example, if we decide on political and economic reasons.</s>
1140	Imagine what would happen in the world.	Ku duba ku ga wani irin abu ne zai faru a duniya.	<pad> I think something will happen in the world.</s>
1141	Today we cannot do so because we are in need of oil revenues.	A yau dai ba za mu iya yin hakan ba, saboda kuwa muna da bukatar wadannan kudaden shigan.	<pad> Today we can't do that, because we need these revenues.</s>
1142	If one day our economy becomes independent of oil revenues and oil exports, the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic will manage to gain this advantage, which will have an extraordinary effect on the world.	A duk ranar da tattalin arzikin kasar nan ya wadatu daga dogaro da kudaden shiga na man fetur, to kuwa al'ummar Iran da tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci a Iran za su sami wani irin karfi ta yadda tasirinsu zai zamanto mai karfin gaske a duniya.	<pad> Every day that the economy of Iran is freed from its dependence on oil revenues, the people of Iran and the Islamic Republic of Iran will gain such strength that their influence will be so strong in the world.</s>
1143	This is the point we must reach. Well, this requires support. It is necessary to support exports.	Wajibi ne mu cimma hakan. To hakan dai lamari ne da ke bukatar taimako da goyon baya; wajibi ne a goya wa wannan lamari na fitar da kayayyaki waje baya.	<pad> We have to achieve that. But this is a process that needs help and support; we have to support the export industry.</s>
1144	On the other hand, our exporters and those in charge of exports have certain duties to fulfill. Wrong actions of our exporters would show their effect in the case the countries that are the major destinations of our exports. It is bad to send low-quality products and products with unfavorable packaging and it is bad to have delays in delivery.	To a wannan bangaren ma su kansu masu fitar da kayan da kuma jami'ansu suna da wani nauyi a wuyansu.

Aikawa da kayayyakin da ba a bukatarsu, munanan kayayyaki, jinkiri wajen aikawa da kayan, dukkanin wadannan abubuwa ne masu muni.	<pad> But also the exporters and their employees have a responsibility. In the countries mentioned above, we have heard of bad behavior by some exporters. Sending unwanted goods, spoiled goods, delays in delivery, all these are bad things.</s>
1145	Successful companies throughout the world have managed to keep their customers satisfied for 100 or 150 years.	Akwai kamfanoni a duniya wadanda tsawon shekaru dari zuwa dari da hamsin suka yi suna kera kayayyaki da kuma sayar da su ga masu saye da kuma ci gaba da samun yardarsu.	<pad> There are companies in the world that have been producing and selling goods to customers for 100 to 150 years and still maintaining their trust.</s>
1146	For example, imagine a German or Swiss company that has been selling a certain product for 150 or 160 years and it still has its customers in our country and other countries.	A matsayin misali wani kamfani na kasar Jamus ko kuma Swiss kimanin shekaru dari da hamsin zuwa dari da sittin suna kera kayayyaki da kuma sayar da su kuma har ya zuwa yanzu suna da masu sayen kayayyakinsu a kasar mu da ma sauran kasashe.	<pad> For example, a German or Swiss company has been producing and selling goods for about 150 to 160 years and they still have customers in our country and other countries.</s>
1147	Why?	Saboda me?	<pad> Saboda me?</s>
1148	Exporters must take these points into consideration.	Wajibi ne masu fitar da kayayyaki su yi la'akari da wadannan abubuwa.	<pad> Manufacturers must take into account these things.</s>
1149	This requires a culture, the culture of developing high-quality products that are supposed to be sent to foreign countries.	Hakan lamari ne da ke bukatar wata al'ada; al'ada da kyautata aiki cikin kayayyakin da ake samarwa don amfani na cikin gida da kuma waje.	<pad> That is a matter that requires a culture; a culture and excellence in the production of products for domestic and foreign use.</s>
1150	The issue of fighting economic corruption is also very important.	Batun fada da ta'annuti wa tattalin arziki shi ma lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske.	<pad> The fight against economic inequality is also a very important issue.</s>
1151	As long as there is nobody on the inside to help an outsider, that outsider cannot give rise to economic corruption.	Matukar dai wannan lalatacen mutumin bai sami wani lalataccen mutum a cikin gwamnati wanda zai taimaka masa ba, to ba zai sami damar yin ta'annuti ga tattalin arzikin ba.	<pad> Unless this poor person finds another poor person in the government to help him, he will not be able to make a profit from the economic boom.</s>
1152	Therefore, government officials have a responsibility to be extremely sensitive in governmental organizations to the emergence and infiltration of economic corruption.	A saboda haka jami'an gwamnati suna da wani nauyi a wuyansu wajen hana yaduwar fasadi na tattalin arziki a cikin cibiyoyin gwamnati.	<pad> For this reason, government officials have a responsibility to prevent the spread of economic fraud in government institutions.</s>
1153	For example, when you examine a sample of chickens on a chicken farm and find out that a certain disease has started in that place, you do not show mercy because you know that if you fail to take action out of consideration for that particular chicken farm, then the consequences will not be limited to a few thousand chickens.	A matsayin misali a lokacin da kuka fahimci cewa wata cuta ta kunno kai cikin gonan kaji, to babu wata rahama da tausayi da za ku nuna (wajen kawar da kajin da suka kamu da wannan cutar); saboda kun san cewa idan har kuka yi sako-sako, to kuwa cutarwa da za ta faru ba za ta takaita kawai ga wadansu dubban kaji ba ne; lamari ne da zai yadu, a saboda haka kuke daukan tsattsauran matakai.	<pad> For example, when you learn that a disease has started in the pigs, you will show no mercy or pitifulness; because you know that if you do not act quickly, the harm will not be limited to a few thousand pigs; it will spread, so you take extreme measures.</s>
1154	The same is true of corruption.	To shi ma fasadi na tattalin arziki haka yake.	<pad> corruption and economic inequality</s>
1155	I am addressing to this point to our government officials: if you feel or see that there is a possibility for corruption in governmental organizations, you must not hesitate.

1156	Economic corruption is a syndrome that spreads very fast and is highly contagious. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to this point.

1157	Preparing a comprehensive plan for the development of the cooperative sector is one of the things that is absolutely necessary to do. The issue of our cooperative sector has been stressed in the policies specified in Article 44 of the Constitution.	Daya daga cikin abubuwa na wajibi shi ne tsara cikakken shiri na ciyar da bangaren hadin gwuwai gaba; wanda a cikin wannan siyasa ta 44 mun yi ishara da wannan lamari na hadin gwuiwa wanda wajibi ne a aiwatar da hakan.	<pad> One of the responsibilities is to develop a comprehensive plan for the development of the cooperative sector; and in this policy 44 we have made reference to this cooperative issue which must be implemented.</s>

1159	The points which were raised by one of the gentlemen about offering banking facilities to small businesses and other such issues can be taken care of through the cooperative sector.	Kamar yadda daya daga cikin ‘yan'uwa ya yi ishara da hakan ya ce ana iya amfani da irin rangwamin da bankuna suke bayar da dai sauransu, to za a iya cimma hakan ne a karkashin inuwar wannan hadin gwuiwan; wato mafi kyaun hanyar cimma hakan ita ce wannan hadin gwuiwan; hadin gwuiwa wace ta dace da hankali da kuma doka.	<pad> As one of the brothers indicated, that we can use the discounts that banks offer, etc., then we can do that under the umbrella of this union; that is, the best way to do that is through this union; a union that is logical and legal.</s>
1160	This is practical. Another essential point is that we must make serious efforts to point out investment opportunities to the private sector.	Wani lamarin na asali na gaba shi ne mu ba da muhimmanci ga batun bayyanar da damar zuba jari da ake da ita a kasar nan ga bangaren ‘yan kasuwa.	<pad> Another important issue is to highlight the investment opportunities available in the country to the business community.</s>
1161	That is to say, those who are active in the private sector should know what the investment opportunities are. Everybody should be informed of the opportunities and the information should not just be available to a particular group of people.	Wato wajibi ne bangaren ‘yan kasuwa su fahimci a ina ne ake da dama na zuba jari, wajibi ne kowa ya sami labari, kada ya zamanto wadansu ne kawai za su amfana da hakan.	<pad> The business community must understand where there are investment opportunities, it is necessary for everyone to be informed, not only some people will benefit from it.</s>

1163	Such information should be available to everybody.	Wajibi ne bayanai su zamanto ga kowa da kowa.	<pad> The information must be available to everyone.</s>
1164	Of course this issue was pointed out in previous administrations as well and certain things have been done in the 9th and 10th administrations, but what has been done is not enough.

1167	By Allah's favor, those who love the country, the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic and those who are interested in the future of this nation will be encouraged by this meeting to have a more serious presence in the arena of economic activities.	Ina fatan insha Allahu wannan zaman zai zamanto wani lamari da zai kara sanya mutanen da suke kaunar kasar nan da wannan al'umma da wannan tsarin Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma makomar wannan al'umma za su kara kaimi da himma, su kara irin ayyukan da suke yi cikin hikima da nuna sanin ya kamata.	<pad> I hope that this time will be a time that will make people who love this country, this nation, this system of the Islamic Republic and the future of this nation to take more initiative and courage, to increase the kind of work they are doing with wisdom and understanding.</s>

1183	This is the characteristic of Islam: all opportunities, all moments and all stages of life should be utilized to bring about perfection and spiritual and material progress for humanity. We Iranians can use this occasion to move towards what Islam has demanded from us and towards Islamic teachings and Islamic ahkaam [Islamic rules extracted from religious texts through Islamic jurisprudence].

The second is about this year which has just begun; taking into account the theme and name of this year, the Year of Economic Development, and what should be done during this year.</s>
1193	In the third part of my speech I will speak about the regional issues: the issues of the Middle East, North Africa and the events that are happening in this Islamic region. I will discuss these issues in the light of the hypocrisy and plots of the enemies of the Islamic Ummah.

1194	"Regarding the first issue, I can say that last year's slogan - namely, ""Intensified Effort and Labor"" - was observed throughout the year. Our people managed to make intensified efforts in different areas."

"<pad> To the first point, I can certainly say that the name of the year 1389 - ""Year of Great Activity and Braveness"" - was really observed throughout the year, and our people in all parts of the country showed their true courage and braveness.</s>"
1195	Of course intensified effort and labor reveal their effects in the long term, but it is possible to see the signs of intensified effort and labor when you take a brief look at the year 1389, what the government officials did and how our dear people cooperated with their officials.	Ko da yake sakamakon wannan himma mai girma da kuma aiki tukurun za a gansu da kuma fahimtar su ne a nan gaba; to amma a irin wannan kallo na farko-farko ma cikin yanayin shekara ta 1389 da kuma irin ayyukan da jami'an kasar nan suka aikata, da kuma abubuwan da mutane tare da taimakon jami'ansu suka aikata da kuma bayyanar da shi a fili, to kuwa ana iya ganin alamar rubanya himma da kuma aiki tukuru.	<pad> Although the results of this great determination and hard work will be seen and understood in the future; but even in this first-hand look at the situation of 1389 and the activities of the national army, and what the people with their army have done and shown it publicly, we can see the sign of a double determination and hard work.</s>
1196	The signs are clearly visible in many areas.	Lalle ana iya ganin hakan a fagage da yawa.	<pad> However, this can be seen in many other fields.</s>
1197	Let us start with science and technology.	Bari mu fara daga batun ilimi da fasaha.	<pad> We're starting with education and technology.</s>
1198	At the beginning of the year 1389 I found the opportunity to visit an important industrial center of the country. During the last few days of the year I found another opportunity to visit a technology exhibition, and I saw the long-term results of the year-long movement with my own eyes.

1199	In the area of advanced science and technology, I would tell you that what we have achieved in the country is far more than what the people know about.	Irin ci gaban da aka samu a fagen ilimi da fasaha a yau din nan a kasar nan nesa ba kusa ba ya fi abin da ake sanar da mutane cewa an cimma su; lalle zan iya bugun kirji in sanar da ku hakan.	<pad> The educational and scientific progress that has been made in the country today is far more than what is being reported to people; I can really be proud to tell you that.</s>
1200	A prominent scientific movement started in different areas several years ago, and fortunately this movement has gained further momentum on a daily basis.	Tun shekarun da suka gabata aka fara wannan gagarumin yunkuri na ilimi a fagage daban-daban, wanda abin farin cikin shi ne cewa a kowace rana sai dada ci gaba ake yi.	<pad> Since the years ago, this great educational effort has been undertaken in different fields, and the good news is that every day it's getting better and better.</s>
1201	"Once I quoted an infallible Imam (a.s.), saying, ""Knowledge is grandeur."" It means that knowledge is a source of power for nations and individuals."	A wani lokaci a baya na taba karanto wata ruwaya da aka ruwaito ta daga wajen wani Ma'asumi (amincin Allah ya tabbata a gare shi) da ke cewa: 'Ilimi mulki ne', wato ilimi da masaniya lamari ne da zai samar da karfi ga wata al'umma da kuma wani mutum.	"<pad> I once read a hadith from a Prophet (may Allah be praised of him) that ""Knowledge is power"", meaning knowledge and knowledgefulness is something that can give power to a community and a person.</s>"
1202	This is a characteristic of knowledge and technology.	To ilimi da fasaha suna da irin wannan siffar.	<pad> Science and technology have the same character.</s>
1203	Today the country is clearly moving towards obtaining knowledge in many areas, especially in newly-established and highly advanced fields.

1204	Fortunately one can see that our scientists and youth are making accelerated progress in different areas - in biotechnology, in aerospace technology, in nanotechnology, in stem cell research, in producing crucial radiopharmaceuticals, in producing antineoplastic drugs, in producing wind turbines which decrease the country's dependence on oil to a large extent, in building supercomputers which are extremely important for the country, in technologies related to new sources of energy. All of these achievements require advanced knowledge.

1205	As I said last night in my New Year address, the reports prepared by prestigious international centers show that in this area our country is moving forward faster than many countries in the world. These reports show that the pace of our progress is several times more than the average rate of progress in the world.	Kamar yadda na fadi cikin sakon idin Nurouz a daren jiya cewa cibiyoyin bincike daban-daban na duniya sun bayyana cewar a wannan fagen kan kasar ku tana gaban mafi yawa daga cikin kasashen duniya, sannan kuma irin ci gaban da ake samu a kasar nan ya rubanya irin ci gaba na tsaka-tsaki na duniya.	<pad> As I said in my Eid message last night that various international research agencies have shown that the country is ahead of most of the world's countries in this field, and the development it has seen in the country has doubled the development of the middle-class of the world.</s>
1206	There are 2, 3 important points about scientific and technological progress which I would like to discuss now.	Akwai wadansu batutuwa guda biyu zuwa uku masu muhimmanci da suke cikin wannan lamari na ci gaban ilimi da fasaha wanda ni ina ganin ya dace in yi bayani kansu.	<pad> There are two or three important issues in this matter of education and technology that I think it is appropriate for me to discuss.</s>
1207	The first point is that most of the scientists who are doing these things are young.	Batu na farko shi ne cewa mafi yawa daga cikin masanan da suke gudanar da ayyukansu a wannan fagen, matasa ne.	<pad> The first thing is that most of the professionals who work in this field are young.</s>
1208	The average age of the scientists who are involved in these endeavors is 35. That is to say, they are mostly young, and it is necessary to trust these youth. Of course there are also experienced and faithful professors who are involved in these scientific endeavors, and this is very valuable.	Shekarun wadannan masana dai shi ne shekaru talatin zuwa talatin da biyar - wato mafi yawansu matasa ne - wanda wajibi ne a dogara da wadannan matasan. Tabbas akwai tsoffin masana masu imani da suke gudanar da ayyukansu a wannan fagen, wanda kuma wajibi ne a yi kokarin amfanuwa da hakan.	<pad> The age of these experts is 30 to 35 years old - that is, most of them are young - and we must depend on those young. Of course, there are faithful older experts who are still working in this field, and we must try to benefit from their work.</s>
1209	The next point is that those who do these impressive things have a lot of self-confidence, and this self-confidence is the main asset.	Batu na gaba shi ne cewa mutanen da suke gudanar da wadannan ayyuka masu girma, mutane ne da suke da ruhi mai karfi, mutane ne da suka dogara da kansu; wanda hakan shi ne babban jari.	<pad> The second thing is that the people who perform these great works are people with a strong spirit, people who are self-reliant; and that is a great capital.</s>
1210	Manpower is the main asset, and this is what our country enjoys.	Jari na asali shi ne karfi na mutane. Wannan shi ne abin da kasar mu take da shi.	<pad> The real wealth is the power of the people. This is what our country is known for.</s>
1211	Our youth are making progress in this arena with high morale, and they believe that they can do anything, anything for which the country has the necessary infrastructures.	Matasan mu suna ci gaba da gudanar da wannan aiki cikin karfin gwuiwa, sannan kuma sun yarda da cewa dukkanin wadannan ayyuka wadanda tushe ne na ci gaban wannan kasar lamurra ne da za su iya gudanar da su.	<pad> Our young people are continuing to carry out this work with great energy, and they believe that all these tasks that are the basis of the development of this country are responsibilities that they can fulfill.</s>
1212	The next point regarding the issue of scientific progress is that the chain of science, technology, production and commercializing the products is in the process of being established. And this chain is very important.	Batu na gaba cikin lamarin ci gaban ilimi shi ne cewa silsilar ilimi, fasaha, samar da ilimin da ake bukata da kuma sayar da shi - wanda hakan lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske - lamari ne da a halin yanzu ake ci gaba da gina shi.	<pad> The first point in the development of knowledge is that the pyramid of knowledge, technology, provision of needy knowledge and its sale - which is a very important thing - is now being built.</s>
1213	That is to say, we produce knowledge, turn it into technology, develop products, market the products through international trade and produce wealth for the country.	Wato ana samar da ilimi sannan a mayar da shi zuwa ga wata fasaha, a samar da abin da ake bukata sannan kuma a kai wannan abin da aka samar din zuwa ga kasuwannin duniya wanda hakan zai samar wa wannan kasa da dukiya ne.	<pad> The creation of knowledge and its transformation into technology, the production of necessities and the export of this produced product to the world market that will provide the country with wealth.</s>
1214	This is the way in which production of knowledge contributes to national wealth and addresses the needs of the people.	Hakan mayar tafarkin samar da ilimi zuwa ga dukiya ta kasa ne da kuma biyan bukatun mutane.	<pad> It is a way of transforming education into national property and meeting the people's needs.</s>
1215	Our dear people should know that all economic experts - both the experts who agree with the economic views of the current administration and the experts whose economic views are different from the views of the current administration - unanimously agree that redistributing subsidies is necessary, essential and very constructive.	Yana da kyau al'ummar mu masu girma su san cewa dukkanin masana tattalin arziki - shin wadanda mahangarsu ta tattalin arziki ta yi daidai da ta gwamnati mai ci ne, ko kuma wadanda ra'ayinsu na tattalin arziki ya saba wa mahangar gwamnatin - dukkaninsu sun yi amanna da cewa manufantar da rangwamin da gwamnatin take bayarwa lamari ne da ya zama wajibi sannan kuma mai amfani matuka.	<pad> It is good for our noble people to know that all economic experts - whether they agree with the government's economic policy, or disagree with the government's economic policy - have believed that rationalizing the government's subsidies is a necessary and very beneficial measure.</s>
1216	Entering this arena was very difficult, and the ground was not fully prepared.	Shiga cikin wannan fagen wani aiki ne mai wahalar gaske; sannan kuma fagagen aiwatar da hakan ba a riga da an samar da su ba.	<pad> Entering this field is a difficult task; and the frameworks for implementing it are not yet established.</s>
1217	Thankfully this work has already been initiated.	Alhamdu lillahi a halin yanzu dai an riga da an fara wannan aikin.	<pad> Alhamdulilah, this work has already been started.</s>
1218	To be fair, the cooperation between the government and the people was excellent.	Kuma alal hakika hadin kan da ake samu tsakanin gwamnati da al'umma a cikin wannan aiki, hadin kai ne mai kyau.	<pad> And really the cooperation between government and the people in this work is a good cooperation.</s>
1219	The people offered excellent cooperation when practicing the Subsidy Redistribution Law. The effects of this policy will gradually become clear in the future, although some of the positive effects have already revealed themselves.	Yunkurin mutane a wannan fagen yunkuri ne mai kyaun gaske. A sannu a hankali za a ga tasirin hakan; duk kuwa da cewa a halin yanzu ma an fara ganin tasirinsa mai kyau.	<pad> The efforts of people in this field are very good. It will be seen slowly; although it is already beginning to show its positive effects.</s>
1220	The primary goal of the law is to distribute subsidies in a fair way. The government distributes subsidies among the people.	Manufa mai muhimmanci na wannan aikin, a matakin farko, ita ce raba irin rangwamin da gwamnati take bayarwa tsakanin mutane cikin adalci.	<pad> The main purpose of this work, in the first place, is to provide fairness in the distribution of government benefits among people.</s>
1221	This is a great leap towards establishing social justice.	Hakan wani mataki mai girma ne da aka taka, wajen tabbatar da adalci na zamantakewa.	<pad> That is a great step forward in the pursuit of social justice.</s>
1222	Managing the consumption of the country's resources - especially water and energy resources - is the second goal.	Wata manufar kuma ta daban, ita ce gudanar da albarkatun kasa (yadda ya dace); ciki kuwa har da ruwa da makamashi.	<pad> Another goal is to manage the land resources (wisely); including water and energy.</s>
1223	"I named the 1387 as ""The Year of Reforming the Norms of Consumption"" meaning being economical and avoiding waste."	"Shekaru biyun da suka gabata, mun sanya wa shekarar sunan ""Shekarar Gyara Yadda Ake Amfani Da Albarkatun Kasa""; tsumi da tattali da kuma nesantar almubazzaranci."	"<pad> Two years ago, we named the year ""Year of Improving the Use of National Resources""; saving and cutting back on wastage and avoiding waste.</s>"
1224	The Subsidy Redistribution Law is one of the ways in which we can truly reform the norms of consumption.	Wannan daya ne daga cikin hanyoyin da za mu iya gyara irin yadda mu ke amfani da albarkatun kasa yadda ya dace na hakika; wanda ya zuwa yanzu dai an ga tasirin hakan.	<pad> This is one of the ways we can improve our use of natural resources in a more efficient and effective way; and so far we have seen some results.</s>
1225	Energy consumption has been reduced during the few months that the Subsidy Redistribution Law has been practiced, and this is beneficial to the country.	Cikin wadannan 'yan watannin da aka shafe ana aiwatar da wannan shiri na manufantar da irin rangwamin da gwamnati take bayarwar, yadda ake amfani da makamashi ya sauko kasa sosai; wanda hakan lamari ne da zai amfani kasar nan.	<pad> In the last few months, as a result of the government's initiative to implement the reductions in energy use, the energy consumption has been reduced significantly; which will benefit the country.</s>
1226	Wasteful use of bread and flour - which are great divine blessings and a lot of efforts go into producing them - has been reduced. Consumption has been balanced in this regard. This is among the benefits we have already obtained.	Irin yadda ake almubazzaranci da biredi da yadda ake zubar da shi da kuma lalata alkama - wanda babbar ni'ima ce ta Ubangiji sannan kuma cikin wahalhalu ake samo ta - ya ragu ainun, an sami daidaito cikin yadda ake amfani da shi.	<pad> The waste of bread and the destruction of wheat - which is a great blessing of God and a difficult harvest - has been reduced, and there has been a more even use of it.</s>
1227	Of course, by Allah's favor, there will be many other benefits in the future, and reforming the economic structure is among these benefits.	Wannan daya ne daga cikin irin alfanun da aka samu kuma da yardar Allah a nan gaba ne za a ga amfanin hakan sosai. Haka nan gyara yanayin tattalin arziki ma yana daga cikin wannan lamarin.	<pad> This is one of the benefits that has been gained and with God's help we will see the full benefit of it in the future. The economic improvement is also part of this.</s>
1228	The increase in non-oil exports was another sign of intensified effort and labor in the economic arena.	Haka nan kuma daga cikin ayyukan da suke nuni da rubanya himma a fagen tattalin arziki, shi ne kara irin kayayyakin da ake fita da su waje wadanda ba man fetur ba.	<pad> Another of the measures that show the reorientation of the economic effort is to increase the export of non-petroleum products.</s>
1229	Unfortunately our country has depended on oil exports since decades ago.	Abin bakin cikin shi ne cewa shekaru aru-aru kenan kasafin kudin mu ya dogara ne da man fetur.	<pad> The sad part is that for years our budget has been dependent on oil.</s>
1230	All economists who care about our country reject this policy, but we have been used to this state of affairs. It is wrong to export oil and use the money to manage the country.	Hakan kuwa abu ne wanda dukkanin masana tattalin arziki masu kishi suke yin watsi da shi; an saba da wannan hanya a wannan kasa ta mu. A tono man fetur, a sayar sannan kuma a ci gaba da gudanar da kasa da kudin da aka samu; wannan hanya ce da take cike da kuskure.	<pad> That is what all egoistic economic experts ignore; this is the way we have been doing in this country. Mine oil, sell it and run the country with the money; this is a very wrong way.</s>
1231	Many years ago I said that one of my wishes is that one day we will be able to run the country without exporting even one single drop of oil.	Mu dai shekara da shekaru kenan na fadi cewa daya daga cikin fatan da nake da shi shi ne a sami wata ranar da za mu iya gudanar da wannan kasar ba tare da mun sayar da man fetur ba idan bukatar hakan ta taso.	<pad> For years I have said that one of my hopes is that one day we can run this country without having to sell oil if the need arises.</s>
1232	This has not happened so far. Of course it is very difficult to do this.	Tabbas ba aiki ne mai sauki ba, aiki ne mai tsanannin wahala.	<pad> Tabbas is not a simple task, it is a difficult task.</s>
1233	Increasing our non-oil exports helps us move closer to this goal, and this is already happening.	Kara irin kayayyakin da ake sayarwa wadanda ba man fetur ba lamari ne da zai kusata mu da manufar da muke da ita.	<pad> Making the most of non-petroleum products is a step that will bring us closer to our goal.</s>
1234	A great leap was made in this regard in the year 1389.	An aiwatar da ayyuka masu girma a shekarar 1389 a wannan fagen.	<pad> 1389 saw large works in this field.</s>
1235	Confronting the sanctions in an intelligent and firm manner is one of the things that shows intensified effort and labor in the economic arena.	Haka nan kuma daga cikin abubuwan da suke tabbatar da rubanya himma da kuma aiki tukuru a fagen tattalin arziki shi ne yadda gwamnati cikin hikima ta tinkari takunkumin da kasashen yammaci karkashin jagorancin Amurka da kuma biyayya ido rufe na wasu gwamnatocin Turai suka sanya wa Iran.	<pad> Another example of the government's determination and hard work in the economic field is how it has managed to overcome the sanctions imposed by Western powers under the leadership of the United States and some European governments.</s>
1236	Since the beginning of year 1389 they have been trying to intensify their sanctions on Iran.	Tun daga farkon shekarar 1389 a tunaninsu sun kara irin takunkumin da suka sanya wa Iran.	<pad> From the beginning of 1389, in their opinion, they have increased the pressure on Iran.</s>
1237	According to their calculations, the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation should have been brought to their knees in 5-6 months. This was what they thought.	Su da kansu cikin lissafin da suka yi - wanda labarin hakan yana iso mana - su da kansu suna fadin cewa wannan takunkumi kan cikin watanni biyar zuwa shida zai dunkufar da Jamhuriyar Musulunci da kuma al'ummar Iran; wannan shi ne zaton da suke yi.	<pad> They themselves in their calculations - which we know - they themselves say that this sanctions will destroy the Islamic Republic and the people of Iran in five to six months; that's their estimate.</s>
1238	Through the sanctions they wanted to make life so difficult for the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic that the people would protest against the Islamic Republic. This was their goal.	Suna tunannin cewa ta hanyar wannan takunkumi za su sanya lamurra su zamanto masu wahalar gaske ga al'ummar Iran da kuma takura fage wa al'ummar Iran ta yadda su da kansu za su fito don nuna rashin amincewarsu da Jamhuriyar Musulunci; wannan ita ce manufarsu.	<pad> They think that through this ban they will make things much worse for the people of Iran and force the people of Iran to come out and show their discontent with the Islamic Republic; that is their goal.</s>
1239	A clever and firm policy was adopted against these sanctions, and the sword of the enemy became blunt.	An gudanar da wani aiki cikin hikima wajen fada da wannan takunkumi ta yadda aka dushe kaifin wukar makiyan.	<pad> The strategy was successful in combating this threat so that the sharpness of the enemy's sword was dulled.</s>
1240	The enemy did not manage to achieve its goals through these sanctions.	Makiya sun gagara cimma manufarsu ta hanyar wadannan takunkumi.	<pad> The bandits failed to achieve their goal through these measures.</s>
1241	Today westerners admit that imposing sanctions on Iran is no longer effective.	A yau su da kansu mutanen kasashen yammacin suke fadin cewa sanya wa Iran takunkumi dai ba shi da wani amfani.	<pad> Today, the Western people themselves say that imposing sanctions on Iran is of no avail.</s>
1242	Our country is an oil exporter, but we used to import huge amounts of gasoline, which is produced from oil.	Daya daga cikin matsalolin aikin mu tsawon lokaci shi ne wannan; mu din nan kasa ce mai fitar da man fetur, to amma kuma muna shigowa da mai din daga waje.	<pad> One of our long-term problems is this; we are a country that exports oil, but we also import oil from abroad.</s>
1243	They said that this was the weakness of the Islamic Republic and that they would block gasoline imports.	Don haka suke fadin cewa wannan shi ne bangaren raunin Jamhuriyar Musulunci, ba za mu bari a shigo da man ba.	<pad> So they say that this is the weakest part of the Islamic Republic, we will not allow oil to be brought in.</s>
1244	Thanks to their sanctions, our government officials started to think of a way to produce gasoline, and their efforts helped our country become self-sufficient in gasoline.	Sakamakon wannan takunkumi na su jami'an mu sun shiga cikin tunani; sun yi kokarinsu, sannan kuma muka zamanto ba ma bukatar shigowa da man fetur.	<pad> Because of this ban, our staff went into deep thought; they tried their best, and we have become independent of oil imports.</s>
1245	I heard similar things from some of the young scientists at the technology exhibition which I visited last month.	Wannan lamari ne da na ji shi daga bakunan wadannan matasa masana a ziyarar da na kai wajen baje kolin da aka gudanar a karshen watan Esfand.	<pad> This is what I heard from these young men when I visited the fair held in the end of Esfand.</s>
1246	"They told me, ""We wanted to build a machine, and we went abroad to buy the required parts, but they told us that they would not sell them to us because of the sanctions, so we realized that we had to manufacture the required parts as well."	Sun gaya min cewa muna son mu kera wannan na'urar, mun tafi waje don samo shi, sai suka ce mana ai ku kuna karkashin takunkumi ne, ba za su ba mu ba; sai muka fahimci cewa lalle wajibi ne mu samar da hakan da kanmu.	<pad> They told me that we want to make this machine, we went outside to get it, they said that you are under sanctions, they won't give us; then we realized that we had to make it ourselves.</s>

1248	According to government reports, 1.6 million job opportunities were created in the year 1389. If this report is accurate, the number is half a million more than the expected job opportunities.

1274	I would like to briefly mention these requirements.	Zan gabatar da jerin wadannan abubuwan da ake bukata.	<pad> I will list these requirements.</s>
1275	First of all, it is necessary to have the spirit of jihad.	Da farko dai ruhi na jihadi (kokari) wajibi ne.	<pad> First of all, the spirit of jihad (struggle) is a duty.</s>
1276	Since the beginning of the Revolution up until now, our people have been successful whenever they have entered the arena with the spirit of jihad. We saw this during the Sacred Defense and during reconstruction of the country. Currently we can see the same thing in the scientific movement of the country.

1277	If we maintain this spirit of jihad in different areas - that is to say, if we do our duty for the sake of God in a tireless and serious manner - this movement will undoubtedly continue.

1278	The second requirement is to strengthen spirituality and the spirit of religious faith in society.	Na biyu shi ne karfafa ababen da suke kyautata ruhi da imani da kuma kishin addini cikin al'umma.	<pad> The second is to strengthen the means that improve the spiritual and religious values and beliefs of the people.</s>
1279	Dear people, everybody should know that piety in our society and among our youth will help our nation in worldly matters as well.	Wajibi ne kowa da kowa ya san wannan; sanya kishin addini cikin kasa da kuma cikin matasa, hakan zai taimaka wa al'umma cikin lamurran da suka shafi duniyar su.	<pad> It is necessary for everyone to know this; instilling the love of religion in the nation and in the young, will help the people in the matter of their world.</s>
1280	It is wrong to think that piety among the youth reveals its effects only during itikaf in mosques or when reciting Dua Kumeyl.

1282	The same is true of economy.	A fagen tattalin arziki ma haka lamarin yake.	<pad> In terms of economics, it is the same.</s>
1283	The spirit of piety and spirituality plays a very important role.	Karfin gwuiwa na addini, lamari ne da ke taka gagarumar rawa.	<pad> Beyond the power of religion, the clock plays an important role.</s>
1284	The next requirement is that the country should not be distracted by side issues. Most of the time there is a central issue in the country which should be the focus of everybody's efforts.

Look, in most cases there are original problems in this country that everyone should take care and respect; it must be the first thing to be given priority.</s>
1285	This is analogous to the situation of a caravan that is on an important mission and is moving through a desert towards its destination, but suddenly something unimportant attracts the attention of the caravan in one part of the desert and it stops moving forward.

1343	In spite of America's critical economic situation, the current US President spent hundreds of billions of dollars from the tax paid by US citizens in order to keep banks, arms companies and oil industries going. That is to say, he is spending the money that belongs to the American people on American companies and banks.

Irin wadannan sharhi da kuke ji ‘yan kasashen yammaci suna yi dangane da matsalar tattalin arzikin da Amurka da wasu kasashen yammaci suka fada ciki da kuma bayyanar da damuwarsu dangane da makomarsu, wani bangare ne na wannan lamarin; ba dukkanin komai ne suke fadi ba.	<pad> Such comments you hear from Westerners about the economic problems that America and other Western countries have been in and their concerns about their future are part of this; they are not saying everything.</s>
1459	Think tanks, backstage policy-makers and designers of global issues in powerful countries of the world - who have control over the majority of global media - do not want the dimensions of this crisis to be revealed to the people of the world, otherwise the dimensions of the crisis are far more serious than this.	Cibiyoyi tunani da masu tsara musu siyasa a bayan fage, masu tsara abubuwan da ke gudana a manyan kasashen duniya - wadanda a mafi yawan lokuta kafafen watsa labarai ma suna hannunsu ne - lalle ba sa son ganin al'ummomin duniya sun fahimci hakikanin matsalar da suke ciki.

1460	By Allah's favor, if there is time, I will say a few sentences in this regard at the end of my speech.	Idan har daga karshen magana ta akwai lokaci zan yi karin haske kan wannan lamarin, insha Allah.	<pad> If there is time at the end of my talk I will explain more about this matter, insha Allah.</s>
1461	Another issue is the emergence of radical movements and terrorist campaigns in the west, particularly in Europe - from European neo-Nazis to American neocons. The previous US government was neocon. These people openly announce their radical positions.	Wani lamarin kuma na daban, shi ne irin yaduwar yunkurin wuce gona da iri da ayyukan ta'addanci a kasashen yammaci musamman a kasashen Turai; kama daga sabbin ‘yan Nazi na kasashen turan da sabbin ‘yan mazan jiyan Amurka wadanda su ne masu tsara wa gwamnatin Amurka da ta gabata abin da za ta yi; a fili suke fadin ra'ayinsu na wuce gona da iri.	<pad> Another thing is the spread of acts of terrorism and extremism in western countries, particularly in Europe; from the new Nazis of Europe and the American neocons who are the planners of the previous US government; they openly express their views of extremeism.</s>
1462	And then they attacked two Islamic countries.	Daga baya kuma sai ya kai hari kasashe biyu na musulmi.	<pad> He later attacked two Muslim countries.</s>
1463	They had other plans as well, but God did not give them time and they were defeated.

1465	The event that happened in Norway should not be viewed as an isolated event.	Wannan lamarin da ya faru a kasar Norway, bai kamata kawai mu dauke shi a matsayin wani lamari mai sauki haka kawai ba.	<pad> The case of Norway should not be taken as a simple matter.</s>
1466	In such conditions, we need to re-evaluate ourselves and see what our situation is.	To a irin wannan yanayin wajibi ne mu sake dubi cikin yanayinmu, mu gani a wani irin yanayi muke.	<pad> To this end, we must look at our situation again, see what kind of situation we are in.</s>
1467	If we fail to see these opportunities, if we fail to identify them, if we fail to use them appropriately, if we fail to use them at the right time, we will suffer losses.	Matukar dai ba mu kalli wannan damar da kuma fahimtarta ba, sannan kuma matukar ba mu yi aiki da ita yadda ya dace ba, haka nan kuma matukar ba mu kama hanyar neman amfanuwa da wannan damar cikin lokaci ba, to kuwa za mu cutu.	<pad> If we don't see and understand this opportunity, and if we don't take advantage of it properly, and if we don't start taking advantage of it in time, then we will miss it.</s>
1468	Sometimes losing an opportunity becomes a threat in itself, a cause of backwardness.	A wasu lokuta shi kansa yin watsi da wata dama da aka samu shi kansa ya kan zama wata barazana, shi kansa ya kan zama wata koma baya.	<pad> In some cases cancer is a waste of an opportunity, cancer can be a threat, cancer can be a setback.</s>
1469	For this reason it is not a bad idea to consider the issues of the country from a general perspective.	A saboda haka babu matsala idan har muka yi dubi na gaba daya wa lamurran da suke faruwa a kasar nan da wannan mahanga.	<pad> So there is no problem if we look at the whole picture of what's going on in our country and in this country.</s>
1470	We must not deceive ourselves. We must not be biased. We have weaknesses and strengths and we need to see both of them.	To sai dai wajibi ne dubin da za mu yi din ya zamanto wani dubi ne da ya yi daidai da hakika; bai kamata mu yi kuskure ba da kuma cin karo da dutse ba.

1471	They constantly promote pessimism in the media and elsewhere.	A kafafen watsa labarai ma da sauran su haka lamarin yake.	<pad> The media and others are reporting the same thing.</s>
1472	"And as soon as one questions their approach, they say, ""You are preventing us from telling the truth."

1474	I usually skim through 10, 20 newspapers each day.	Ni dai a kowace rana na kan duba kimanin jaridu goma zuwa ashirin.	<pad> I read about 10 to 20 newspapers every day.</s>
1475	Certain newspapers publish 4, 5 headlines every day each of which is enough to fill the hearts of weak people with apprehension.	Wasu daga cikin wadannan jaridu a kowace rana suna da wasu kanun labarai wanda kowane guda daga cikinsu ya isa ya jijjiga zuciyar wani mutum mai rauni.	<pad> Some of these newspapers have some short stories that each of them can touch the heart of a weak person.</s>
1476	I will not accuse anybody. But this is a fact and it is wrong.	Mu dai ba muna tuhumar wani ba ne, amma dai wani lamari ne na hakika, wannan kuskure ne.	<pad> We're not accusing anyone, but it's really something else, this is a mistake.</s>
1477	The same is true of the opposite.	Kishiyar hakan ma dai haka take.	<pad> I don't know.</s>
1478	This is wrong too. It is necessary to see both negative and positive points.	Wajibi ne a kalli bangare na rauni tare da bangare mai kyau na irin karfin da ake da shi tare.	<pad> It is necessary to look at the negative side with the positive side and the strengths that we have together.</s>
1479	We need to take into consideration both what the government has managed to do and what it has failed to do.	Wajibi ne ya zamanto abubuwan da gwamnati ta iya aikatawa da kuma wadanda ta gagara aikatawa su zamanto tare.	<pad> The government must always be able to do what it can and cannot do.</s>
1480	Therefore, if we want to have an appropriate evaluation of the country's conditions, we need to see both positive and negative points.	A saboda haka idan har muna son mu fahimci hakikanin yanayin da kasar nan take ciki, wajibi ne mu ajiye bangaren rauni da bangaren karfi su zamanto tare.	<pad> So if we want to understand the real situation of the country, we must let the weak and the strong side sit together.</s>
1481	Today I will just mention a point, but this issue requires a lot of work.	A yau dai zan gabatar da wani takaitaccen bayani ne kan wannan lamarin, to amma akwai bukatar a gudanar da ayyuka masu fadi a wannan bangaren.	<pad> Today I will only give a brief summary of this matter, but there is a need for much more work in this regard.</s>
1482	Positive points will show us the capacities that the country enjoys.	Wadannan abubuwa masu kyau za su nuna mana wata dama da kuma fagen da muke da su a wannan kasar.	<pad> These good things will show us an opportunity and a field that we have in this country.</s>
1483	And the list of negative points will show us the priorities we should take care of.

1485	I have written down 5, 6 things that are the result of the constant movement of the Islamic Republic over the past 32 years. Of course there have been ups and downs. That is to say, certain years and administrations have been good and certain other years and administrations have been less good, but generally these are the positive things that we have achieved over the past 32 years.	A nan dai na rubuta wasu abubuwa guda biyar zuwa shida wadanda wani yunkuri ne da aka ci gaba da yinsu tsawon shekarun wannan tsari na Jamhuriyar Musulunci tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da biyun, kowane lokaci da irin nasa, wato wasu shekarun, wasu zamunnan, wasu gwamnatocin da kyau wasu kuma an dan bar su a baya. To sai dai a yanayi na gaba daya, a tsawon wadannan lokuta muna da wadannan abubuwa masu kyau.	<pad> Here I have written five to six things that are an attempt that has been made throughout the years of this system of the Islamic Republic for thirty two years, each time with its own, which is that some years, some eras, some governments have been good and some have been bad. But in general terms, throughout these times we have these good things.</s>
1486	The first strength of the Islamic Republic is that it has proven its capabilities are superior to the threats. This is a very important point.	Batu na farko daga cikin abubuwa masu kyau da kuma irin karfi na wannan tsarin wanda kuma tsarin ya tabbatar da shi, shi ne nasara da yin galaba a kan barazana daban-daban da aka yi (wa tsarin); wannan lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske.	<pad> The first of the good qualities and strengths of this system, which the system has proven, is the success and overcoming of different threats; this is an important matter.</s>
1487	Over the past 32 years we have encountered many threats - political threats, security threats, military threats, economic threats - which were supposed to harm the Islamic Republic.	Tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da biyu mun fuskanci barazana daban-daban - barazana ta siyasa, barazana ta tsaro, barazana ta tattalin arzikin - manufar wadannan barazanar kuwa ita ce cutar da wannan tsarin.	<pad> Over the last 32 years we have faced different threats - political, security, economic - the purpose of these threats was to harm this system.</s>
1488	Of course they wanted to overthrow the Islamic Republic, which proved to be impossible for them, so they tried to at least keep the Islamic Republic and Iran backward.	Na'am suna so ne su kifar da wannan gwamnati, to amma da ya ke hakan ba abu ne mai sauki a gare su ba, sai suka so dakatar da tsarin waje guda, su ciyar da kasar nan baya.	<pad> Yes, they wanted to topple this government, but since that wasn't easy for them, they tried to halt the system at least for a time, to move the country backwards.</s>
1489	The Islamic Republic has overcome these threats.	To wannan tsari dai ya yi nasara a kan dukkanin wadannan barazana.	<pad> This system has therefore overcome all these threats.</s>
1490	Some of these threats were posed directly by foreigners, such as the sanctions.	Wasu daga cikin wadannan abubuwa su kansu ‘yan kasashen waje ne kai tsaye suka tsara su, kamar wannan lamari na takunkumin.	<pad> Some of these things were directly set up by foreigners, like this matter of the ban.</s>
1491	Sanctions have been there for many years, but they have been intensified in the recent years. They themselves spoke about crippling sanctions.	An sanya wa kasar nan takunkumi na tsawon shekara da shekaru, to sai dai a shekarun baya-bayan nan sun kara kaimi da tsananta, su da kansu suke fadin cewa takunkumi ne mai ruguzawa.	<pad> The country has been under sanctions for years and years, but in recent years they have intensified and become more severe, they themselves say that the sanctions are a threat.</s>
1492	They acted directly or used the United Nations - which was under their control - to impose these sanctions.	Wadannan takunkumi a wasu lokuta ta hanyar Majalisar Dinkin Duniya - wacce damar a hannunsu ta ke - wasu kuma su da kansu kai tsaye ne, lalle sun sanya mana wannan takunkumin.	<pad> These bans are sometimes through the UN - which is their power - and sometimes directly by them, they have imposed these bans on us.</s>
1493	These were the threats in which foreigners were directly involved.	Wadannan abubuwa ne da suke da alaka da ‘yan kasashen waje, wanda suke da hannu cikinsu kai tsaye.	<pad> These are things that are related to foreigners, who are directly involved in them.</s>
1494	There were certain other threats - such as the issue of ethnicities in the country - which were caused by domestic factors although the enemy could have used these factors to his advantage. The Islamic Republic overcame all these threats. Today different ethnicities are living together in the country in a brotherly way.	Haka nan kuma akwai wadansu barazanar wadanda suka kunno kai sakamakon abubuwan da suka faru na cikin gida; duk da cewa makiya sun yi amfani da hakan, a matsayin misali lamarin kabilu na kasar nan. To wannan tsarin dai ya yi nasara a kan dukkanin wadannan abubuwa. A yau kabilu daban-daban na kasar nan, suna ci gaba da rayuwa tare da junansu; sannan kuma ana iya ganin yadda suke jin cewa suna tare da wannan tsari da kuma kishinsa.	<pad> Also there were other dangers that arose from internal events; although the enemies used it as an example, the race issue. But this system has overcome all these things. Today the different tribes of the country continue to live together; and one can see how they feel that they are with this system and its opponents.</s>
1495	I believe this is one of the most important strengths.	A ra'ayina wannan daya ne daga cikin bangarorin karfi da muke da shi.	<pad> In my opinion this is one of our strong points.</s>
1496	We should pay attention to this point when enumerating the strengths of the Islamic Republic.	Wajibi ne mu lura da wannan lamarin a lokacin da muke lissafa bangarorin karfi na wannan tsarin.	<pad> We must take this into account when we list the strengths of this system.</s>
1497	The Islamic Republic has been faced with the enmity of the most powerful people in the world and it has been forced to deal with constant threats single-handedly for 32 years, but it has managed to overcome all these threats. This is a very important point.	Wannan tsarin shi kadai din sa, ba tare da goyon baya na kasa da kasa ba sannan kuma ga makiya masu karfi na abin duniya, wacce ta fuskanci barazana daban-daban tsawon wadannan sheakru talatin da biyu, to amma ta yi galaba a kan dukkanin wadannan barazana; wannan lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske.	<pad> This system, alone, without international support and with strong world enemies, has faced different dangers over the last 32 centuries, but has overcome all these dangers; this is an important event.</s>
1498	I believe this is the most important strength of the Islamic Republic.	A ra'ayina wannan shi ne bangaren karfi na farko na wannan tsarin.	<pad> In my opinion this is the first strong point of this system.</s>
1499	The second strength is the trust between the people and the Islamic Republic.	Na biyu: shi ne yarda da juna dake tsakanin mutane da gwamnati.	<pad> Second: it is the trust between people and government.</s>
