South African health officials have asked the maker of the COVID-19 vaccine, Aspen, to reopen its Eastern Cape offices. This follows a report by Reuters that the chief of Aspen had a plan to close the offices because the new vaccine was not available.

The theory was widely accepted because there were reports that Africa relied on imported vaccines which were expensive and the vaccine was not enough.

77	"""Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production. Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low. So, we understand the situation where they are, and we sympathize with them,"" he said. "	"""Kuzengereza kubayitsa katemerayu ndi chimodzi mwa zifukwa zomwe zikuchepetsa chiwerengero cha anthu obayitsa kapena kufuna katemera wochuluka zomwe zimakhudza kapangidwe.

"""Delaying the vaccination is one of the reasons why the number of vaccinations or requests for a larger amount of vaccine is being reduced. We understand that they are selling medications and that they cannot produce a larger amount of vaccine when they know that the needs are limited,"" they said."
78	Mohale said for now, South Africa has enough vaccines. He adds that in March, 100,000 vaccines expired. And more are due to expire in June and July. 	A Mohale ati  pakali pano dziko la South Africa lili ndi katemera wokwanira.

He added that in March, 100,000 vaccine was lost and another 100,000 is expected to be lost in June and July.

Komabe, iwo ati kukhazikitsidwa kwa katemera wa Aspen ndi kofunika popeza palibe yemwe amadziwa zobwera m'tsogolo.	But they say that the establishment of Aspen's vaccine is important because no one knows what is ahead.

82	"""This is just indicating again how important it is that this continent looks at policy reform. This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies. How are we going to make sure that we create a marketplace and eco-system that will absorb local capacity? Otherwise, we will not have capacity locally in a sustainable manner and were going to get the next pandemic and we will be unprepared, and we will not have health security,"" said Terblanche.

83	She believes money should also be put into educating people on the importance of vaccines. 	Iwo akukhulupilira kuti ndalama zikuyenera kugwiritsidwa ntchito pophunzitsa anthu za ubwino wa kayemerayu.	They believe that money should be used to teach people about the benefits of this scheme.
84	"""We need to ensure that we also put effort into advocacy for vaccination. Because we now have 17% of the continent that is vaccinated. We need to get them to at least 40% to ensure that we fully arrest this pandemic,"" she said. "	"""Tikuyenera kuwonetsetsa kuti tikuyesetsa kulimbikitsa ubwino wa katemerayu chifukwa pakali pano, anthu 17 pa 100 ali wonse ndi amene anabayitsa katemerayu mu Africa.

87	When Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office four years ago, Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based group that promotes press freedom, raised Ethiopia's ranking in its international press freedom index by 40 places.

When Ethiopian President Abiy Ahmed was elected four years ago, the Paris-based Reporters Without Boarders group, which fights for the rights of journalists, reached the top 40 of the world press freedom list.

240	In its weekly report on the pandemic, the U.N. health agency said there were about 3.8 million new infections and more than 15,000 deaths last week, a 17% and 3% drop on the week respectively. But those figures are believed to be a significant underestimate of COVID-19's true toll as increasing numbers of countries abandon widespread testing and surveillance.

In its weekly report, the United Nations Health Organization says there are approximately 3.8 million cases of the disease and more than 15,000 deaths last week, which lowers the number by 17% and 3%.
241	Still, WHO noted that cases rose by about a third in Africa and 13% in the Americas. There was also a nearly 70% jump in deaths reported in India, although that was attributed to delayed reporting rather than a recent surge of disease. 	Komabe WHO yapeza kuti chiwerengero cha odwala chakwera ndi magawo atatu pamene anthu 13 mwa 100 aliwonse ku America ali ndi matendawa.

But the World Health Organization (WHO) has found that the number of cases has halved by three percentage points when 13 of 100 Americans are infected with the disease. About 70 of 100 Indians die each year despite claims that this is because of a late report rather than a spread of the disease.
242	Last week, authorities in South Africa said they had noted an uptick in COVID-19 cases attributable to the BA.4 mutant of omicron, although they said it was too early to tell if that would result in a significant new wave of disease. Although the BA.4 version of COVID-19's omicron variant appears more infectious than omicron, WHO said there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death.

Last week, South African officials said they found a spike in the number of cases of a new type of COVID-19 called BA.4 omicron, although they cannot say whether this is a new wave of the virus. WHO said there was no evidence that this virus is causing a significant increase in deaths or hospitalizations.
243	"Salim Abdool Karim, a public health expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that while only a ""modest"" rise in cases had been noted, South Africa was also in the middle of a holiday period and testing had dropped significantly. He said the cases were slowing and were ""not following a rocket-like upward trajectory we would expect"" in another spike of disease.

If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. In a press conference on Wednesday, WHO's emergency chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, warned those countries that have stopped following immediate measures to prevent the spread of the virus, just as the European countries did.
245	"""The jury is still out as to how seasonal this virus will become,"" he said, explaining that it wasn't proven yet that COVID-19 would naturally drop off in the summer and that the world could yet face more unsettling variants. ""If people are crowded together in conditions where a new variant is spreading, you will see high levels of transmission,"" he said. "	"""Oweruza akufufuzabe ngati kachilombo koyambitsa matendawa kamasintha ndi nyengo,"" Iwo anatero kufotokoza kuti sizinatsimikidwe ngati chiwerengero cha odwala COVID-19 chingatsike m'nyengo yotentha kapena ngati tingawonenso kusintha.

"""The authorities are still investigating whether the virus changes with the weather,"" he said, adding that it is not yet clear whether the number of cases of COVID-19 will increase in the summer or if we will see a change. ""If a population increases in areas where the new virus is spread could increase the number of cases,"" he said."
246	Meanwhile in China, authorities continued to crack down on cities, including Beijing, where more than 10% of the subway system was shut down in an effort to curb the virus' spread, after authorities in the capital already closed down indoor dining, gyms and school classes.

This is true, Chinese authorities are continuing to close cities including Beijing where 10 of 100 subway stations have been closed to reduce the spread of the virus and authorities have already closed restaurants, gyms and schools.
247	In Shanghai, rigid and widely derided restrictions have led to shortages of food and medical aid along with a wider — though likely temporary — impact on the national economy. Desperate, outraged citizens have confronted authorities at barricades and online, screamed out of their windows and banged pots and pans in a sign of frustration and anger.

The Turkish president is the leader of the world to condemn Saudi Arabia for the killing of a Saudi journalist, Jamal Khaashoggi, who was murdered in an office in Istanbul.
290	The killing was linked to the crown prince, a charge he denied. But the decision earlier this month to move the Khashoggi murder trial from Istanbul to Riyadh is seen as a gesture by Ankara, opening the way for Erdogan's visit.

293	Shared concerns over Iran's growing influence in the region -- along with its nuclear energy program -- provide important common ground between Riyadh and Ankara, says international relations professor Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University, especially as American attention is expected to pivot away from the Middle East and toward China. 	Pali kudandaula kuti ganizo la dziko la Iran lofuna kupitilira ndi kukhazikitsidwa kwa mphamvu ya nukiliya ndi komwe kukuyanjanitsa Riyadh ndi Ankara, a polofesa Soli Ozel a ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Kadir yomwe ili ku Istanbul ndiwo ananena izi.

""And the Iranians are also constantly sending signals that they are not going to let others draw them away from those countries - Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - where they have quite a lot of influence."" "	"""Dziko la Turkey limadziona ngati lili ndi mphamvu zambiri zoposera dziko la Iran.

"If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. ""Turkey looks like it has more power than Iran. All these countries and all the European countries want Iran to be isolated from the rest of the region,"" said Ozel. ""Iran shows signs that it does not allow any other country to take them out of Iraq, Lebanon and Syria, where it has a strong position."""
295	Erdogan's Saudi visit is part of a wider policy of seeking to repair relations across the region in a bid to end its isolation. The Turkish president has recently visited the United Arab Emirates and earlier this month hosted the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog. 	Ulendo wa a Erdgan wopita ku Saudi ndi gawo la lamulo lalikulu lofuna kukonzanso maubale m'chigawochi pofuna kuthetsa kudzipatula. Pulezidenti wa chi Turkish anayenderanso United Arab Emirates posachedwapa komanso kumayambiliro a mwezi uno analandira pulezident wa ku Israel, a Isaac Herzog.

296	But analyst Ozel warns Ankara is in a vulnerable position. 	Koma akatswiri Ozel wachenjeza kuti Ankara ili pachiopsezo.	But experts warned Ankara was in danger.
297	"""Turkey alienated, insulted, offended a lot of countries with which it had at least decent relations. And they all recognize that this burst of diplomacy is coming out of weakness rather than strength,"" said Ozel. "	"""Dziko la Turkey linadzipatula, kunyoza komanso kukhumudwitsa mayiko ambiri omwe linali nawo pa ubale wabwino. Ndipo onsewa akuzindikira kuti mgwirizano wadzidzidziwu ukubwera kamba ka kufooka osati kulimbika kwa Turkey,"" anatero a Ozel."	"If you can't translate simply say you don't know. ""Turkey has isolated, insulted and humiliated many countries with which it had a good relationship. And all of them are aware that this strange alliance is a result of Turkey's weakness rather than determination,"" said Ozel."
298	But analysts say Ankara is banking on its importance as a potential bulwark to Iranian ambitions, a factor that may help overcome any remaining hostility among the neighbors it is trying to win back. 	Koma akastwiri ati Ankara ikutenga ubwino wake ngati kuthekera kodzimangira linga pofuna kudziteteza ku zofuna za Iran, njira yomwe ingathandize kuthana ndi udani pakati pa omwe ayandikana nawo kuti ubale ubwelere.

300	Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change. 	Saudi Arabia ikufuna kukonza malamulo ake a nkhanza koma kusinthaku kukutsekerezedwa ndi kupha komanso kuzunza otsutsa zomwe zikubweretsa mafunso odabwa kuti ndi zinthu ziti zomwe zitasinthe.

301	The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system. 	Ufumuwu umadziwika ndi kutanthauzira kwake kwa lamulo la chisilamu la sharia lomwe ndi gwero la malamulo okhudzana ndi milandu.	The kingdom is known for its translation of the Islamic law of sharia which is the source of the law of the cases.
302	But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East. 	Koma m'miyezi yapitayi, dzikoli lapitilira ndi kusintha malamulo zomwe akatswiri ati zikhoza kupangitsa kuti makhothi awo azigwira ntchito ngati ena onse ku mayiko a aluya.	But in the past months, the country has moved on with changes in the law that experts say could allow their courts to work like any other in the developed countries.
303	That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences. 	Izi zagwirizana ndi m'ndandanda wa malamulo atsopano okhudza ufulu wa azimayi banja likatha komanso mphamvu ya oweruza milandu kupereka chigamulo kwa olakwa.	This is consistent with the new list of laws regarding the rights of women after divorce and the power of judges to sentence the guilty.
304	Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image. 	Chaka chatha, mwana wa mfumu, Prince Mohammed bin Salman yemwe anadziika yekha pampando analengeza kuti njira zimenezi kuphatikizapo malamulo omwe analembedwa koyamba okhudzana ndi milandu komanso zilango zake, akufanana ndi cholinga cha Saudi Arabia chofuna kumasukira dziko ndi kuchotsa chithunzithunzi choyipa.	Last year, the son of the king, Prince Mohammed bin Salman who was sworn in, announced that these steps, including the first written laws relating to cases and punishments, are consistent with the Saudi Arabian goal of opening the country and changing the negative image.
305	Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases. 	Ngakhale otsutsa avomereza kuti kusinthaku kupangitsa zochitika ku ma Khothi a ku Saudi zizidziwika pena.	Even though the judges accept that the change will make the cases of the Saudi Courts more visible.
306	But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government. 	Koma palibe chiyembekezo choti pakhala kufewetsa malamulo okhwima oletsa kuyankhula zakukhosi kapena ngati makhothi asiye kuwonetsa tsankho kwa omwe akuoneka kuti ndi otsutsa boma.	But there is no hope that the strict laws on speech will be relaxed or that the courts will stop showing racial profiling to those who appear to be opposition.
307	"And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to ""terrorism."" "	Pamene pali kusintha, pa nthawi yomweyo akuluakulu akukumbutsa zomwe zinachititsa kuti Saud Arabia ikhale ndi mbiri yankhanza, ndipo ati izi zili chomcho kamba ka kuphedwa kwa anthu 81 pa tsiku limodzi m'mwezi wa March pa milandu yokhudzana ndi ziwawa.

368	Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism. When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives. 	Natalia Sancha anasankha kugwira ntchito ndi anthu ena ngati njira yochitila utolankhani. Akapita kukagwira ntchito, iwo amayankhula ndi ena omwe akulemba nkhani yomweyo kuti amve mbali yawo.	Natalia Sancha chose to work with others as a way to promote journalism. When they go to work, they talk to other journalists who are writing the same story to hear their side.
369	This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important. 	Mbali ina, izi zikuchitika chifukwa chofuna kuyankhulapo pa nkhani zomwe sizimakambidwa, koma ngati wolemba nkhani wamkazi mu chigawo chomwe abambo akulamula, iwo ati kugwirizana ndi kuthandiza amayi omwe amagwira nawo ntchito kwakhala kofunika.	In some cases, this is done to discuss topics that are not discussed, but as a journalist in the authority of the fathers, he said cooperation and support for women who work with them has been necessary.
370	"""I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story,"" the 42-year-old journalist said.

"""I can speak with both women and men and I understand that women think and see things the same way when they write stories,"" said the 42-year-old journalist."
371	That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria. 	Ganizo lochita mgwirizanowu linabwera mu 2020 pamene wosindikiza mabuku anawafunsa a Sancha ngati ali ndi chidwi cholemba bukhu lokhudzana ndi Syria.

"Women ""know a lot because we can go to places where male colleagues didn't.

377	Having women reporters has an impact, she noted. 	Iwo anazindikira kuti kukhala ndi atolankhani aakazi kuli ndi ubwino.	They realised that having women journalists was a advantage.
378	"""If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict.""

Kudziwa kumeneku kunathandiza pamene a Abbas a zaka 34, anakagwira ntchito ndi a Sancha mu March, 2021.

This knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, worked with Sancha in March 2021. They went to a refugee camp in the north of Syria to ask questions of women who fight with the Islamic State (IS) to write a story for El Pais.
394	"""While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the camp refused to talk to them,"" Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS. "	"""Pamene ndinali ku Qamashli (kumpoto kwa Syria), ndinakumana ndi wolemba nkhani komanso anzanga a chi British awiri, omwe anali okhumudwa kuti Shamima Begum ndi akazi ena kumaloku anakana kuyankhula nawo,"" anatero a Sancha kutanthauza mtsikana yemwe anachoka kwawo ku Britain ali ndi zaka 15 kukalowa gulu la IS."	"When I was in Qamashli (north of Syria), I met with a journalist and two British friends, who were upset that Shamima Begum and other women in the area refused to speak to them,"" said Sancha, referring to the 15-year-old girl who left Britain to join the Islamic State."
395	"""Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men. But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents,"" Sancha said. "	"""Yemwe amawathandiza anali munthu wabambo kotero akazi omenya nkhondowa sanayankhule nawo chifukwa anasintha ndipo sayankhula ndi anthu aamuna.

"""The man who helped them was a man, so the women who won the war didn't speak to them because they had changed and don't speak to men.

396	Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added. 	A Abbas anali ndi gawo kuti ayankhule ndi amayiwa, iwo anawonjezera.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
397	Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist. 	Kusiyana ndi a Sancha ndi a Gebeily, a Abbas anakulira ku chigawo chaching'ono cha Kurdish komwe kunalibe kulemba nkhani kufikira nthawi yomwe nkhondo inayamba mu 2011.	Except for Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in a small Kurdish region where there was no newspaper until the start of the 2011 war.
398	"""Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines,"" Abbas said. ""It took a lot of sacrificing for me to convince my family and society that Im as good, if not better, as my male colleagues."" "	"""Anthu m'chigawochi anazolowera kuwona amayi akutenga zida ndi kumenya nkhondo osati kuwona amayi atatenga chojambulira munsewu kapena akuyima patsogolo, "" anatero Abbas.

"""People in this region were used to seeing women taking weapons and fighting, not seeing women taking pictures on the road or standing up,"" said Abbas. ""It took me a lot of effort to ensure that my family and my neighbours knew that I was doing well, possibly even better than my male colleagues."""
399	Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign. 	Kulemba nkhani kunawasangalatsa chifukwa nkhani za mayiko aluya zimakambidwa ndi wolemba nkhani achimuna, pafupi ngakhalenso kunja.	Writing was interesting to them because stories of developing countries are often written by male journalists, closely or abroad.
400	"""The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East, that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region,"" Abbas said. "	"""Kulemba nkhani sikunasinthe chifukwa cha izi, ngati amayi olemba nkhani a konkuno komanso kunja angapatsidwe mwayi wolemba nkhani za mayiko aluya, kalembedwe ka nkhani kakhoza kusintha, zomwenso zingasinthe mmene anthu ena amawonera chigawo chino,"" anatero a Abbas."	"""Writing hasn't changed because of this, if women writers from across the world are given the chance to write about developing countries, the writing style can change, which can also change the way people view this area,"" Abbas said."
401	Sancha also believes women in journalism have an impact on the way issues are viewed in the region, including post-traumatic stress disorder and the effect it has on female health, and subjects such as violence and alcohol. 	A Sancha akukhulupilira kuti amayi olemba nkhani ndiwokhudzidwa ndi mmene anthu amaonera zinthu m'chigawochi, kuphatikizapo kukhala ndi maganizo oopsa kamba ka zomwe zinachitika ndi zotsatira zake pa umoyo wa amayi komanso pa ziwawa ndi mowa.	Sancha believes that women who write stories are affected by the way people view things in the region, including having a negative attitude about what happened and its impact on the health of women and alcohol and drug use.

"	“Anthu otsutsa boma amathawa dzikolo kapena kulowa nawo mmagulu oukila boma kunja kwa dzikolo kapena ku dziko la Congo komwe alibe mwayi wopereka maganizo ena”, iwo anatero. “Malamulo onse abwino amene boma lakhala likukhazikitsa- kuonjezerapo kulongosola zisankho, zisankho za maiko, za mtsogoleri komanso aphungu mu Chaka cha 2003- zidzasowa chilungamo chifukwa sizinakhazitsidwe pa malo ololela kupikisana kwachilungamo, iwo anatero.

799	"""We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities,"" Davis said.

809	Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week.  Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.

812	"So, [after adhering to the agreement in 2013], we are surprised to see that this time we are left out.""
