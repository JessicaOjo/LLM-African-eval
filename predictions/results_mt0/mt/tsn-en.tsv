337	The Democratic Alliance (DA) has described as irrational and obscure a law that strips South Africans of their citizenship.	Mokgatlho wa Democratic Alliance (DA) o tlhalositse molao o o sa utlwagaleng le go tlhaloganyega o o amogang maAforika Borwa boagi jwa bona.	The Democratic Alliance (DA) explained the unexplained and unexplainable law that allows South Africans to become citizens of their own country.
338	This follows complaints from citizens based in London who tried to renew their South African citizenship, only to discover that they are no longer South African citizens because they have claimed additional citizenship.	Se se latela dingongorego go tswa go baagi ba ba nnang kwa London, fa ba leka go ntšhwafatsa boagi jwa bona jwa Aforika Borwa, ba lemoga fa ba sa tlhole e le baagi ba Aforika Borwa ka gonne ba kopile tlaleletso ya boagi.	It follows complaints from residents living in London, trying to suppress their South African nationality, realizing that they are no longer South African citizens because they have applied for citizenship.
339	This is because, under the current Citizenship Act in South Africa, you have to first apply to the Department of Home Affairs for permission to get another citizenship.	Se ke ka ntlha ya gore, ka fa tlase ga Molao wa Boagi mo Aforika Borwa wa ga jaana, o tshwanetse go dira kopo kwa Lefapheng la Merero ya Selegae go bona tetla ya go bona boagi jwa naga e nngwe.	That's because, under the current Citizenship Act in South Africa, you must apply to the Local Government Office to obtain a visa to a foreign national.
340	However, DA MP Adrian Roos says the party is opposed to this law and will fight it in the High Court on behalf of thousands of South Africans who have lost their citizenship without their knowledge.	Le gale, Leloko la palamente la DA Adrian Roos a re lekoko le kgatlhanong le Molao o, mme le tlaa lwantshana le ona kwa  kgotlatshekelong e e kwa godimo mo boemong jwa diketekete tsa MaAforika Borwa a a latlhegetsweng ke boagi kwa ntle ga kitso ya bona.	However, the Democratic Alliance MP Adrian Roos said the party was against the law, and it will fight it in a high court in the case of thousands of South Africans who were robbed without their knowledge.
341	The DA is challenging this law in court.	DA e gwetlhana le Molao ono kwa kgotlatshekelo.	Return only the translated translation. If you cannot translate the law simply say you don't know.
342	It is not a particularly rational law seeing as the Department of Home Affairs has previously stated that it has nothing against dual citizenship.	Ga se molao o o utlwagalang jaaka le Lefapha la Merero ya Selegae le kile la tlhalosa gore ga le kgatlhanong le boagi jwa dinaga tse pedi.	It's not a constitutional issue as the Local Government Department has already stated that it is not against the citizens of both countries.
343	But if that’s your policy, then you must not say you support dual citizenship.	Fela ke molao wa lona, lo seke lwa re lo tshegetsa boagi jwa dinaga tse pedi.	Only return to the original. If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
344	If you look at the interim Constitution, it spoke about the fact that no citizen shall be without justification, and this was changed in the final Constitution.	Fa o lebelela Molaotheo wa nakwana, o bua ka ntlha ya gore ga go moagi yo a tlaa nnang kwa ntle ga tshegetso ya molao, mme se se fetotswe mo Molaotheong.	If you look at the temporary Constitution, you say that no citizen will live without legal protection, but that has been changed in the Constitution.
345	They removed the words without justification to say this right should obsolete that you shouldn’t be deprived of your citizenship.	Ba tlositse mafoko ntle le go tlhalosa gore tshwanelo eno e tshwanetse e seke ya tsenngwa tirisong gore o seke wa ganelwa ka boagi jwa gago.	They removed the words without specifying that this right should not be used to prevent being discriminated against by your citizenship.
346	So the argument of the DA is that if anything, you should have to legitimately and actively renounce your citizenship before you can lose it, says Roos.	Ka jalo ngangisano ya DA ke gore, le fa go ka nna jang, o tshwanetse go nna le tumelelo ya go ka tlogela boagi jwa gago pele bo ka go latlhegela, go bua  Roos.	The debate in the DA is that, regardless of what, you must have the permission to leave your citizen before it can lose you, said Roos.
347	Below is the full interview with DA MP Adrian Roos.	Fa tlase, ke ditherisano tse di feleletseng tsa leloko la DA Adrian Roos.	In the bottom, are the final talks of DA Adrian Roos.

354	But I think we should take from what the President has said that this is being attended to.	Fela ke akanya gore re tshwanetse go tsaya  se Moporesidente a se buileng gore kgang e e lebeletswe.	I think we should take the President's statement as a warning that the issue is being treated.
355	Earlier the Special Investigation Units Kaizer Kganyago says they’re still investigating and plan to conclude the probe soon.	Pejana, Kaizer Kganyago wa Yuniti ya Dipatlisiso tse di Kgethegileng ,o rile ba sa ntse ba batlisisa mme ba ikaeletse go konosetsa patlisiso e ka bonako.	Previously, Kaizer Khanyago of the Independent Research Institute said that they are still investigating and hope to further the research soon.
356	Deputy President David Mabuza says about R654 million meant to assist military veterans is lying idle in the Department of Defence and is not being used because the department has not been working properly.	Motlatsamoporesitente David Mabuza a re dimilione di ka nna  R654 tse di tshwanetseng go ka bo di thusa baitseanape ba badiredi ba sesole di sasaila fela mo Lefapheng la Tshireletso mme ga di dirisiwe ka gonne lefapha le ntse le sa dire sentle.	The deputy prime minister David Mabuza said that about R654 million would have been used to help the army's intelligence officers but were spent in the Security Department and not used because the department is not working well.
357	Mabuza was addressing a group of military veterans in Limpopo on Saturday.	Mabuza o ne a bua le setlhopha sa baitseanape ba badiredi ba sesole kwa Limpopo ka Lamatlhatso.	Mabuza spoke to a military commander in Limpopo on Saturday.
358	He has urged military veterans to form one single group instead of fighting one another.	O kopile baitseanape ba sesole gore ba ipope go nna ngatana e le nngwe go na le gore ba lwantshane ka bo bona.	He asked the soldiers to become one army rather than fight against each other.
359	Well, the money has not been used, it lies in the department because there is a number of problems, but the military veterans are complaining.	Le gale, madi ga a ise a dirisiwe, a dutse kwa lefapheng ka gonne go na le mathata a le mantsinyana, fela baitseanape ba badiredi ba sesole ba a ngongorega.	However, the money has not been used, it is still in the bunker because there are a few problems, but the commanders of the military are complaining.
360	The biggest problem that we are facing is the verification program which affects the no statutory forces.	Bothata jo bogolo jo re lebaganeng le jona ke lenaneo la netefatso le le amang thata tlolo molao .	The biggest problem we have is the verification system . If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know .
361	Mabuza says he hopes that now that a Director-General of the department has been appointed, military veterans will get the assistance they want.	Mabuza a re o solofela  gore ka jaanong Mokaedi-Kakaretso wa Lefapha o setse a tlhophilwe, bagaka ba sesole ba tla fitlhela thuso e ba e batlang.	Mabuza said he hoped that now that the Ministry's Chief of Staff has been elected, the soldiers would find the help they needed.
362	He has urged military veterans across all the political spectrum to organise themselves and to enable the government to adequately support them.	O rotloeditse bagaka ba sesole go ralala dikarolo tsotlhe tsa sepolotiki go ipaakanya le go letlelela puso go leka go ba tshegetsa.

He said that former military officers from the past freedom period also struggled to verify their evidence.
367	You must try and organise yourselves, we don’t want these groupings amongst yourselves because we don’t understand why you are fighting amongst yourselves.

He said he didn't know. When he learned that he took part in arranging meetings with him, he could do a paid job, so he noticed at some point.
941	But of course, it would be highly irregular for that level of work to be done in his office and he not have a clue about it.

960	Curlewis says the defence will have to bring exceptional arguments to court for the special plea to be successful.

961	On Wednesday this week, Zuma’s legal team led by Advocate Dali Mpofu presented the court with a statement in terms of the special plea that will be argued on July 19.	Ka Laboraro wa beke e, setlhopha sa molao sa ga Zuma, se eteletswe pele ke mmueledi Dali Mpofu ba tlhagisitse polelo kwa kgotlhatsekelong ka mabaka a boikuelo jo bo kgethegileng e go tlaa ngangisanwang ka yona ka di 19 tsa Phukwi.

963	While the State will also have a chance to present their case in this regard, Downer told the court that separate counsel was preparing this response because he was in fact the main subject of this special plea.

964	Former President Zuma pleads not guilty:	Moporesidente wa maloba Zuma ga a ipone molato.	The President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, does not feel guilty.
965	Independence and impartiality	Go ikemela ka nosi le go se tseye letlhakore	Self-reliance and not taking sides.
966	Through the statement read in court, Advocate Mpofu told the court that Zuma believes that Advocate Downer lacks independence and impartiality.	Ka ntlha ya polelo e e badilweng kwa kgotlhatshekelo, Mmueledi Mpofu o boleletse kantoro gore Zuma o dumela gore Mmueledi Downer o tlhoka go ikemela le tekatekano.	Because of the written statement, the Attorney General told the office that Zuma believes that Mr Downer needs to be independent and consistent.
967	There are facts and circumstances that give me a reasonable impression that Downer had conducted himself in a manner that lacks independence and impartiality that is necessary for a lawful prosecution.	Go na le mabaka le maemo a a mphang megopolo e e utlwagalang gore Downer o ne a itshwere ka tsela ya go tlhoka go ikemela ka nosi le go sa tseye letlhakore, e e botlhokwa mo tiragatsong ya molao.	There are reasons and circumstances that make me think that Downer acted in a way that required self-determination and independence, which is important in the legal system.
968	Downer failed to uphold the standard and prosecutorial independence needed to secure that my trial is fair and conducted in accordance with the Constitution.	Downer o reteletswe ke go tshegetsa maemo a a tlhokegang go sireletsa boikemedi gore tsheko ya me e lolame mme e dirwe go ya ka Molaotheo.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know Downer has been responsible for maintaining the conditions required to protect the integrity of my claim to ensure that my case is fully prosecuted and handled according to the law.
969	Downer placed himself as a witness against me when he filed an affidavit in support of the Democratic Alliance application to review and set aside a decision by the NPA to terminate my prosecution	Downer o ipeile go nna paki kgatlhanong le nna fa a ne a tlatsa afidafiti ka tshegetso ya tshwaragano ya temokerasi, kopo ya go sekaseka le go beela thoko tshwetso e e dirilweng ke NPA go fedisa tsheko ya me.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know Downer took a stand against me when he filled out the affidavit with support for a trade union partnership, a request to review and withdraw the decision made by the NPA to end my case.
970	Curlewis says Judge Piet Koen will be positioned to hear the special plea as the trial Judge, saying it falls within the trial proceedings.	Curlewis o bolela gore moatlhodi Piet Koen o tla bewa mo maemong a go reetsa kopo e e kgethegileng ya go ikarabela mo tatofatsong le tsheko jaaka moatlhodi, a bua gore e wela mo ditsamaisong tsa tsheko.	Curlewis says that Judge Piet Koen will be asked to consider a special request to assume responsibility for the prosecution and trial as a judge, saying that it falls within the scope of the trial.
971	No, that is not possible.	Nnyaa, seo ga se kgonege.	No, that can't be done.
972	The pre-proceedings have already taken place that means that the judge that is currently presiding will see the matter end out unless there is another reason for recusal that might come out later on.	Dipotso tsa ntlha di simolotse, se sa raya gore moatlhodi yo o tshwereng marapo ga jaana o tla go tla bona kgang e ya kwa bokhutlong, ntle le fa go na le lebaka lengwe la go ikgolola le le tlaa tlang kwa morago.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know The first questions have started, which doesn't mean that the judge who is holding the case now will see the case going to the end, unless there is a reason to escape.
973	But that is not anticipated	Fela seo ga se a solofelwa.	But that was not expected.
974	When offered the opportunity to respond on the matter of the special plea, Thales defence led by Advocate Barry Roux, humorously responded that they were merely passengers in the matter.	Fa a ne a newa tšhono ya go arabela kopo e e kgethegileng, tshireletso ya ga Thale e e eteletsweng pele ke moatlhodi Barry Roux, o arabile ka metlae gore bona e ne e le bapalami fela mo kgannyeng eno	When given the opportunity to answer a specific request, Thal's defense, led by Barry Roux, answered with a smirk that they were just drivers in this case.
975	But he says the defence has a feat ahead of them to argue the special plea.	Mme a re go na le phitlhelo e e kwa pele ga bona go ganetsa kopo e.	But he said there was a delay before them to reject the request.
976	Once the special plea is determined, only then is the expected of the accused to formally then plea in terms of the lets call it the general type of pleas namely guilty or not guilty.	Fa boikuelo jo bo kgethegileng bo ka bontsha maikaelelo, ke yona fela nako e ka yona molatofadiwa a ka solofelwang go ikarabela ka semmuso mo tatofatsong ka mabaka, mme e re tla e bitsa ka mofuta wa kopo, e leng molato kgotsa e se molato.	If a specific appeal can show intent, it is the only time when the accused can expect to fully contribute to the charges for reasons, and we will call it a request, which is a complaint or a complaint not a complaint.
977	In this instance, not guilty as he has done.	Mo lebakeng le, ga a ipona molato.	In this case, he doesn't feel guilty.
978	It is not uncommon to enter into a special plea  the one they have raised in section 106.	Ga go makatse go tsena mo kopong e e kgethegileng, e le nngwe. Yona e e tlhagisitsweng mo karolo 106.	It's not surprising to enter a special meeting, one. It's listed in Chapter 106.
979	The 1 H to be specific where they actually want to remove the State Prosecutor from the proceedings.	Tota tota 1 H, kwa ba batlang go tlosa motšhutšhisi wa naga go ditshekong.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know
980	In this instance advocate Billy Downer, now in very limited circumstances, will a court generally uphold such a special plea?	Mo lebakeng le mmueledi Billy Downer, jaanong mo maemong a mannye, a mme gona kgotlhatshekelo e tlaa tshola kopo e e kgethegileng?	In the case of Billy Downer, now in a very small position, would the court have to make a special request?
981	But the grounds that was advanced by Dali Mpofu on behalf of Zuma is that Billy Downer will not be objective and independent in his prosecution of this matter because at one stage filed an affidavit on behalf of the Democratic Alliance in a matter that was before court and based on that they say he is not independent.	Mme dintlha tse di tlhagisitsweng ke Dali mpofu mo boemong jwa ga Zuma ke gore Billy downer ga a kitla a nna le maikaelelo le go ikemela ka nosi mo tiragatsong ya gagwe mo kgangeng eno, ka gonne o kile a dira maikano mo boemong jwa Democratic Alliance ka morero o o neng o le kwa kgotlatshekelo mme ka ntlha ya seo, ba re ga a ikemela ka nosi.	But the points presented by Dali Mpho in Zuma's position are that Billy Downer will not be focused on independence in his political campaign, because he has previously signed a deal with the Democratic Alliance over a court case and, therefore, he is not alone.
982	Curlewis explains the process that will follow once Judge Koen hands down judgement- possibly not immediately- on the special plea.	Curlewis o tlhalosa tirelo e e tla latelang morago ga gore moatlhodi Koen a neelane ka katlholo. Gongwe e seng ka yona nako eo ya kopo e e kgethegileng.	Curlewis explains the next service after the judge Koen gave his verdict. Maybe not at that time of special request.
983	If the defence is correct in their special plea and if the court upholds it and once again I repeat personally from what I have seen in the case law, and in our law journals and articles and authorities on this issue they will not be successful, but let assume for argument sake they are successful then they will also advance next prey before the court that is to the matter then be struck from the roll which will not happen because they have already pleaded not guilty in all those charges yesterday and if one reads section 106 specifically not talking about 106	Fa tshireletso e nepile ka kopo ya bona ya go ikarabela, mme kantoro e e tshegetsa, ke a ipoeletsa, go ya ka se ke se boneng mo molaong wa rona wa makwalopaka le diathekele le balaodi ba kgang e,  di ka se atlege, fela a re akanye gore di tlile go atlega ka go tswelela pele batla lebelela kgang nngwe kwa kgotlhatshekelo e e amanang le ntlha, mme morago ba tlhaselwe go tswa go lekwalo le le ka se diregeng ka ntlha ya gore sa molato mo dilatofatsong tsa maabane gape fa mongwe a buisa thata karolo 106 e seng go bua ka 106.	If the defense is correct in its request to be responsible, and the office supports it, I believe, according to what I have seen in our printing and printing laws and the authorities involved in this case, they cannot succeed, but I think they will succeed if they continue to look at a case related to the case, and then threaten to be taken away from the letter that cannot be completed because it is illegal to repeat the sentence of yesterday when someone talks about the 106th paragraph rather than the 106th.
984	The 1 H special plea I’m talking about the ordinary pleads of guilty or not guilty and this instance not guilty then the court must make a finding after such a plea only the court can do it, so no the matter will proceed after the 19.	Kopa ya 1 H, ke bua ka di kopo tsa “ke molato” kgotsa “ga ke molato” mme mo nakong e, “ga ke molato, kgotlhatshekelo e tshwanetse ya tlhagisa phitlhelelo ya yona morago ga kopo e. Ke kgotlhatshekelo fela e e ka kgonang go dira seo, ka jalo, kgang e tlaa tswelela morago ga di 19.	"If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know Demand 1 H, I am referring to requests for ""I am guilty"" or ""I am not guilty"" and in this case, ""I am not guilty, the court must declare its acquittal after the claim. It is only the court that can do that, so the case will continue after 19 years."
985	Over the next few days, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) will answer the submission by June 2.	Mo malatsing a le mmalwa a a latelang, bothati jwa Botšhotšhisi jwa Bosetšhaba (NPA) bo tlile go araba ka di 2 tsa Seetebosigo.

986	Zumas legal team is expected to file their heads of argument by July 5, with the NPA following suit by July 12.

The cabinet expressed concerns about the increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 with fears that the country is in the third phase.

Mme ka diketekete tsa tsona di setse di kwadisitswe, Ntshavheni a re ba tlaa tshwanelwa ke go ema lobaka nyana pele ba ka tlhaba.	But with thousands already written, Ntshaveni said they would have to wait a while before they could write.

997	On the alleged corruption in the R150 million Digital Vibes COVID-19 contract and with pressure mounting for Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize to step down, Minister Ntshavheni says in as much as they view any allegation of corruption seriously, the matter was not discussed at the Cabinet level.	Mo kgannyeng ya tlolomolao ya konteraka ya Digital Vibes ya dimilione di le 150 le kgatelelo e tona ya Pholo Ngaka Zweli Mkhize a leng ka fa tlase ga yona ya gore a role tiro, tona Ntshavheni a re ba tsaya ditatofatso tsa tlolomolao tsia, kgang e ga e a atlhaatlhiwa kwa kabineteng.
