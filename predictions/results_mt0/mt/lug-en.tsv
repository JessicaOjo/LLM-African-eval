When people talk about the collapse of Al-Shabaab in Somalia, they mean they were involved in the war and that they were unable to operate a website.
428	Since the Uganda People`s Defence Force cannot achieve that goal, the only feasible option is to withdraw from Somalia.	Olw'okuba nti Uganda People's Defence Force tesobola kutuukiriza kigendererwa ekyo, engeri yokka esobola okukolebwa kwe kuva mu Somalia.	Because the Ugandan People's Defence Force cannot meet the objective, the only way to achieve this is to go to Somalia.

In a National Executive Conference in Gatonya, NRM announced that it had registered 8 million members including those under the age of 18.
433	This was before the EC started the national voter registration exercise which also yielded about 15 million voters, up from 10 million in 2006.	Kino kyaliwo nga EC tennatandika nkola ya kuwandiisa balonzi era kyayambako okutuusa  abalonzi okukunukkiriza obukadde 15 okuva ku bukadde 10 mu 2006.	This happened when the EC was not beginning to introduce a funding system and helped to increase the number of foreign investors to 15 million from 10 million in 2006.

The 2010 census shows that there were 13.9 million older brothers and sisters aged 18 and older.
441	Given the high apathy among Ugandans to register for voting and death of some registered voters, the number of new voters would be fewer.	Olw'okuba nti bannayuganda tebaagala nnyo kwewandiisa kulonda n'okufa kw'abalonzi abamu abeewandiisa, omuwendo gw'abalonzi abapya gwandibadde mutono.	Because the Ugandans don't like to register elections and some elected officials died, the number of new elected officials was very low.
442	However, the EC has said this is not the final figure.	Newankubadde, EC egambye nti guno si gwe muwendo ogw'enkomeredde.	However, the EC said that this was not the maximum damage.
443	Some MPs in the NRM have already accused the secretariat of creating ghost members on the register which could facilitate rigging the primaries.

463	"""The commission categorically denies this allegation"",Eng. Kiggundu said."	Akakiiko keeganira ddala ebyogerebwa bino, yinginiya Kiggundu yagamba.	If you can't translate this, just say you don't know.
464	Kiggundu said that they concluded the update of the national voters' register on June 18, 2010 and retrieved all the equipment from the field.	Kiggundu yagambye nti baamaliriza okuzza obuggya enkalala z'abalonzi nga 18 ogwomunaana, 2010 era ne baggya ebikozesebwa byonna mu bantu.

466	According to Kiggundu, by July 13, the EC had uploaded 4,670,585 voters, which constitute 97% of the voters they registered in the last registration.	Okusinziira ku Kiggundu nga 13 Ogwomusanvu, EC yali etaddeyo abalonzi 4,670,585, abaali baweza ebitundu 97% eby'abalonzi be baawandiisa mu kuwandiika okwasembayo.

467	According to Kiggundu, of the 4,670,585 voters, 4290,634 were registered as new, 326,609 as transferring, and 53,342 whose photos were missing.

The election commission is expected to start counting the votes on November 11 and start counting on 30 November.
469	This means the EC has most of its equipment lying idle when they could earn money needed to boost their election budget if they rented them out.	Kino kitegeeza nti ebikozesebwa bya EC ebisinga tebirina kye bikola era bandifunyeemu ssente okwongera ku mbalirira yaabwe singa babipangisa.	This means that most of the EC instruments are not working and that they get money to increase their margins if they are created.
470	However, the Electoral Commission spokesman Paul Bukenya said the constitution does not allow them to do income generating business.	Wabula, omwogezi w'akakiiko k'ebyokulonda Paul Bukenya yagamba nti ssemateeka tabakkiriza kukola mulimu guvaamu nsimbi.	But, the electoral commission's spokesman Paul Bukenya said that the Constitution does not allow a political corruption scheme.
471	Considering that government has consistently failed to meet the commission's budget, the EC could explore ways of generating its own income.	Okusinziira nti gavumenti ezze eremererwa okutuukiriza embalirira y'akakiiko, EC yandinoonyezza engeri gy'efunamu ssente ezaayo.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. As the government is allowed to reach the conclusions of the committee, the EC explained to me how it earns the money.
472	Last week, the Electoral Commission had to defend itself why it cannot give every opposition party a copy of the national voters' register.	Wiiiki ewedde, akakiiko k'ebyokulonda kaalina okwewozaako lwaki tekasobola kuwa buli kibiina kivuganya kkopi y'olukalala lw'abalonzi.	Last week, the election commission tried to determine why it could not provide a copy of the voter registration document to each party.
473	The Electoral Commission said it would be too expensive.	Akakiiko k'ebyokulonda kaagamba nti kyandibadde kya buseere nnyo.	The election commission said it was very serious.
474	If the EC had other sources of revenue other than relying on remittances from the national treasury, it would reduce on such financial constraints.	Singa akakiiko k'ebyokulonda kaalina we kasobola okuggya ensimbi okusinga okwesigama ku ssente entono okuva mu ggwanika ly'eggwanga, kyandikendeezezza ku buzibu bw'ensimbi nga buno.	If the election commission had more money to spend than using a small amount of money from the foreign exchange market, it would have ended this problem.
475	However, upon growing pressure from the opposition who accused the EC of incompetence, it revised its stand.	Wabula, okusinziira ku maanyi agava mu bavuganya abaanenyezza EC olw'obutaba na busobozi, keetegerezza enkola yaako.	But, based on the authority of the negotiators who accused EC of being unable to act, I have decided to modify its procedures.

507	Gakwerera also claims he was arrested on the advice of Karegyeya.	Gakwerera naye agamba nti yakwatibwa ku magezi ga Karegyeya.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know Gakwerera but says he was taken over by Karegyeya.
508	Further, Rwandan officials have openly accused the South African police of incompetence.	Okwongerako, Abakungu mu Rwanda bazze malumiriza poliisi ya South Africa obutaba na busobozi.	Adding, the Rwandan government has accused South African police of being unable to enforce the law.
509	They claim that immediately Kayumba was shot, the first people taken to make police statements are those he had in the car.	Bagamba nti amangu ddala nga Kayumba akubiddwa amasasi, abantu abaasooka okutwalibwa okukola sitatimenti ku poliisi be bo be yali nabo mu mmotoka.	They say that very soon after Kayumba was shot, the first people to be taken to the police were the ones who were in the car.
510	However, a South African diplomat worsened things when he mentioned in an interview that the Rwandan government was behind the shooting.	Wabula, omukungu okuva e South Africa yasajjula ebintu bwe yayogerera mu yintaaviyu nti gavumenti ya Rwanda ye yali mabega w'okukuba amasasi gano.	But a South African official told the television that the government of Rwanda was behind the shooting.
511	The Kayumba case seems to be setting the relationship between the two nations into a dangerous balance.	Omusango gwa Kayumba gulabise okuteeka enkolagana wakati w'amawanga abiri mu lusuubo olw'obulabe.	The case of Kayumba has ended the diplomatic ties between the two countries.
512	But there is more; the Rwandan government had applied for the deportation of Kayumba on charges of terrorism.	Naye waliwo ekisingawo, gavumenti y'e Rwanda yali esabye okukomyawo Kayumba olw'emisango gy'obuyeekera.	But there was more, the government of Rwanda wanted to sack Kayumba for corruption.
513	On April 6, Spain submitted its own application to deport Kayumba on charges of crimes against humanity.	Nga 6 Ogwokuna, Spain yawaayo okusaba kwayo okuzza Kayumba olw'emisango gy'okutyoboola eddembe ly'obuntu.	Spanish authorities presented their request to extradite Kayumba for genocide on June 6.
514	Two days later, France also applied for the same.	Nga waakayitawo ennaku bbiri Bufalansa nayo yasaba ky'ekimu.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
515	Kayumba could afford to rubbish Rwanda's claims against him because it is a poor country whose accusations can easily be disregarded.	Kayumba yali asobola okugamba nti Rwanda by'emulumiriza nti tebiriimu nsa kubanga ggwanga lyavu nga bye lyogera bisobola okugaanibwa amangu.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
516	However, France and Spain are powerful nations considered to be mature democracies and reasonable in their actions.	Wabula, Bufalansa ne Spain nsi zikirimaanyi ezitwalibwa okuba ne demokolasiya ow'amaanyi n'ebikolwa eby'amaanyi.	But France and Spain are a very stable country with a strong democracy and a very strong economy.
517	So,their applications could carry more weight with South Africa.	N'olw'ekyo, okusaba kwazo kwali kuzito ne South Africa.	That's why their request was rejected by South Africa.
518	What is clear, however, is that by the time he was shot, Kayumba had begun to reassess his options.	Wabula ekyo ekirabibwako, kirinti mu biseera we yakubibwa amasasi, Kayumba yali atandise okukola okusalawo kwe.	But that is not true, during the time of his shooting, Kayumba was beginning to work on his plan.
519	Deportation applications from Spain and France showed that Kayumba and Kagame shared a stronger common threat.	Bufalansa ne Spain okusaba okumuzza, kyalaga nti Kayumba ne Kagame baalina beerinako okutya okw'amaanyi.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know France and Spain asked to bring him back, which showed that Kayumba and Kagame had a serious fear.
520	This common threat was stronger than the issues that separate them.	Okutya kuno kwali kwa maanyi nnyo okusinga ekibaawula.	If you can't translate this sentence simply say you don't know.
521	So, he began making contact with Kigali.	N'olw'ekyo yatandika okukwatagana ne Kigali.	That's why he started to cooperate with Kigali.
522	Kayumba is a close personal friend to Maj.Gen.Steven Kashaka, currently Uganda's military ambassador to South Africa.	Kayumba mukwano nnyo gwa Maj. Gen. Steven Kashaka nga mu kiseera kino ye mubaka w'amagye ga Uganda mu South Africa.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know Kayumba is a close friend of Maj. Gen. Steven Kashaka who is currently the Ugandan military chief in South Africa.
523	According to Francis Gakwerera, this thing was engineered by Patrick Karegyeya, the former director of Rwanda's External Security.	Okusinziira ku Francis Gakwerera, kino kyayongerwamu amaanyi Patrick Karegyeya, eyali akulembera ebyokwerinda bya Rwanda eby'ebweru.	According to Francis Gakwerera, this was further strengthened by Patrick Karegyeya, who was the former Rwandan Foreign Minister.
524	Whenever I travel through South Africa, I meet and talk with Karegyeya because he is also my friend.	Buli lwe ntambula mu South Africa, nsisinkana era ne njogerako ne Karegyeya kubanga naye mukwano gwange.	Every time I travel in South Africa, I meet and talk to Karegyeya because he is my friend.
525	He sometimes picks me from the airport whenever I get into South Africa.	Ebiseera embimu ankima ku kisaawe ky'ennyonyi buli lwe ntuuka mu South Africa.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
526	On this occasion, I got into South Africa on Wednesday and called him on Friday, the day before Kayumba was shot.	Ku mulundi guno, Natuuka mu South Africa ku lwokusatu ne mmukubira ku lwokutaano, olunaku lumu nga tannakubwa masasi.	This time, I came back to South Africa on Tuesday and called on Thursday, one day before I was going to die.
527	On Saturday, I had a lunch appointment with Karegyeya which he cancelled saying he was going to watch soccer.	Ku lwomukaga, nalina enteekateeka y'okulya ekyemisana ne Karegyeya naye n'agisazaamu ng'agamba nti yali agenda kulaba mupiira.	On Sunday, I had a plan to eat lunch with Karegyeya but he turned it down saying he was going to watch the game.
528	He later called me saying Kayumba had been shot.	Oluvannyuma n'ankubira ng'agamba nti Kayumba yali akubiddwa esasi n'afa.	After that he called me saying that Kayumba was killed by a plane.
529	I called him thirty minutes later to ask about Kayumba`s state but he said he was busy and promised to call back.

I called him after three minutes to ask him about the situation in which Kayumba was but he replied that he had something to do and would call me again.

The Mayor explained Mao's desire to avoid political leaders who would simply call themselves political parties as a way to get involved.
812	The Mao group's sudden change of attitude was very surprising given that they have been publicly minimizing the Inter Party Corporation.	Engeri ekiwayi kya Mao okwekyusa mbagirawo kyali kyewuunyisa olw'okuba nti kyali kyagala nnyo amawulire g'omukago ogutaba ebibiina bye byobufuzi.	The way Mao changed his mind was astonishing because he wanted to know more about the political parties.
813	Musumba said they were not interested in spoiling in childish politics.	Musumba yagamba nti tebaali beetegefu kumala biseera mu byabufuzi bya kito.	The mayor said that they were not ready to stay in the political system.
814	She said the Inter Party Corporation had written to the Mao group to join Inter Party Corporation but they refused.	Yagamba nti omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi gwali gwawandiikira ekiwayi kya Mao okugwegattako naye nga kyagaana.	He said that the party which controlled the political parties had written to Mao's wife to join but she refused.
815	They later decided to examine the legal and political implications of accepting one faction of Democratic Party when the other is out.	Oluvannyuma baatandika okwetegereza enkola ey'amateeka n'enkola z'ebyobufuzi ezandivudde mu kukkiriza ekiwayi kya Democratic Party ekimu ng'ekirala tebakolagana nakyo.	After that, they began to look at the laws and political practices that led to the membership of the Democratic Party which some or all of them did not agree with.
816	The Inter Party Corporation then subjected the issue to a legal and political survey.	Omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi ensonga gwagizza ku kunoonyereza kw'amateeka n'ebyobufuzi.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
817	Musumba said, it was then Mao and his group came accompanied by journalists to meet the Inter Party Corporation.	Musumba yagamba nti mu kiseera ekyo Mao n'ekibinja bajja nga bawerekeddwako bannawawulire okusisinkana omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi.	The governor said that at that time Mao and his team were being presented to journalists to avoid a political office building.
818	She said it appears Mao's Democratic Party is neither interested in joining the Inter Party Corporation nor cooperating with them on anything.	Yagamba nti kirabika nga ekiri nti Democratic Party ya Mao teyagala kwegatta ku mukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi oba nga tekolagana nakyo mu ngeri yonna.	He said that it seems likely that the Mao Democratic Party does not want to join any political party or does not agree with it in any way.
819	Mao had said after the Inter Party Corporation meeting that Democratic Party was up to exploring the form.	Oluvannyuma lw'olusisinkana olwo n'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyofuzi Mao yagamba nti Democratic Party yali egezaako okunoonya engeri z'okukolamu emirimu.	After the meeting with the Democratic Party leadership Mao said that the Democratic Party was trying to find ways to improve the work environment.
820	The Mao group wants to field their own presidential candidate but can cooperate with the Inter Party Corporation on other areas.	Ekibinja kya Mao kyagala kusimbawo omuntu waakyo avuganye ku Bwapulezidenti olwo kikwatagane n'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi mu bifo ebirala.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know
821	Mao also said he supports the Inter Party Corporation position to have the current Electoral Commission changed.	Mao era yagamba nti akkaanya n'eky'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi okukyusa engeri ebyobufuzi gye bikolebwamu.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know Mao said that he would like to become a leader who takes part in political parties to change the way politics is handled.
822	Musumba said this was Mao's trick to hinder the IPC from considering the option of accepting the other Democratic Party faction.	Musumba yagamba nti kano kaali kakodyo ka kiwayi kya Mao okulaba ng'omukago gwa IPC tegulowooza ku kya kukkirirza kwegattibwako kiwayi kya Democratic Party ekirala.	The mayor said that this was a move by Mao's party to see if the IPC leader did not think of the amendment to be added to the Democratic Party's amendment.
823	However Mathias Nsubuga, the secretary general of the Mao Democratic Party, said it's the Inter Party Corporation who invited them for a meeting.	Wabula Mathias Nsubuga, ssaabawandisi wa Democratic Party, yagambye nti omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi nti gwayitibwa mu lukungaana.	But Mathias Nsubuga, a spokesman for the Democratic Party, said that the committee was called in protest.
824	Musumba removed Nsubuga's claim.	Musumba yamazeewo Nsubuga by'ayogera.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know what Musumba told Nsubuga.
825	She said Mao's group came for other reasons other than the invitation because they had long ignored it.	Yagamba nti ekiwayi kya Mao kyajja lwa nsonga ndala ezitali ku kuyitibwa kubanga baali baludde nga bagyewala.	He said that Mao's helicopter came for other reasons than being called because they were already gone.
826	Some members of the Inter Party Corporation say they have put on hold the decision to accept one Democratic Party group.	Bammemba abamu ab'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi bagamba nti baayimirizza eky'okusalawo ku kukkiriza okuyingiza ekimu ki biwayi bya Democratic Party.	Some Democratic Party members have said they have decided to leave the party.
827	Dr Frank Nabwiso believes the two groups can reconcile.	Dr Frank Nabwiso alina okukkiriza nti ebiwayi ebibiri bisobola okutabagana.	Dr. Frank Nabucco believes that two diseases can be linked.
828	But the Lubega faction is looking at admission into the Inter Party Corporation rather than reconcile with the Mao group.	Naye ekiwayi kya Lubega kiruubirira bukulembeze bw'omukago ogutaba ebibiina by'ebyobufuzi so si kutabagana n'ekibinja kya Mao.	But the Congolese strategy aims to establish a government that adheres to the political parties rather than fighting Mao's party.
829	In an interview with Lubega before Mbale conference early this year, his position on joining Inter Party Corporation was the same as Mao's. 	Mu mboozi ey'akafubo ne Lubega eyaliwo nga ttabamiruka w'e Mbale tannabaawo, endowooza ye ku kwegatta ku IPC yali y'emu ng'eya Mao.	In a briefing with Lubega when the provincial council was not present, Mao's view on joining the IPC was the same as Mao's.
830	The Democratic Party would not join the Inter party Cooperation because the party always lost their members in such unions.	Democratic party si yakwegatta ku mukago ogutaba ebibiina kubanga ekibiina kizze kiviibwako bammemba bakyo mu mikago ng'egyo.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. The Democratic Party didn't join the political party because the party was already being controlled by its members in such buildings.
831	Observers say he was one sided to take his Democratic Party camp into the 2011 elections without the backing of other opposition parties.	Abatunuulizi b'ensonga bagamba nti yalina kyekubiira okutwala enkambi ye eya Democratic Party mu kulonda kwa 2011 nga tasembeddwa bibiina by'oludda oluvuganya ebirala.	Scientists say he had a chance to lead the Democratic Party in the 2011 election without being endorsed by other parties.
832	They were also facing a lot of pressure from the Mao group.	Era baali basanga okunyigirizibwa kungi nnyo okuva mu kibinja kya Mao.	They were getting a lot of attention from the Mao side.
833	The Mao group ignored reconciliation with the Lubega group.	Ekibinja kya Mao kyesamba okutabagana n'ekibinja kya Lubega.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.

The Mayor of Uganda, Madam Mbidde, told Independent that they had asked the police to stop the protest at the Nsambya Sharing Hall.
838	According to the Independent issue on August 27- September 02, 2010, Mubatsi reported, Mao seeks to work with the Inter Party Cooperation.	Okusinziira ku Independent eyafulumizibwa nga 27 Ogwomunaana okutuka Ogwomwenda nga 02, 2010, Mubatsi yagamba nti Mao anoonya kukolagana n'omukago ogutaba ebibiina.

Omulundi guno Otunnu yanokoddeyo ensonga ezitannakolwako wansi w'enteekateeka z'omukago ogutaba ebibiina ezirina okusooka okukolwako.	This time, Otun pointed out the reasons why the committee was going to be involved in the first phase of the committee's work.
844	It's not the pending arrest of Otunnu that had prevented the Uganda People's Congress from nominating its candidate to Inter Party Cooperation.	Okusibwa kwa Otunnu si kwe kwagana Uganda People's Congress okusunsula abantu baayo okwegatta ku mukago ogutaba ebibiina.

1402	The arrest of Bachisha was surprising given that he seemed loyal to his boss having helped him escape from Rwanda in the middle of the night.	Okukwatibwa kwa Bachisha kwali kwewuunyisa kubanga yalabika ng'omwetowaze eri mukama we oluvannyuma lw'okumuyamba okutoloka e Rwanda mu masekkati g'ekiro.	Bachisha's marriage was very emotional because he looked like a servant to his master after helping him escape from Rwanda in the middle of the night.
1403	He escaped from Rwanda on February twenty-eighth.	Yatoloka okuva e Rwanda nga abiri mu munaana Ogwokubiri.	He left Rwanda on the second of February.
1404	Bachisha was put in the same jail as Gakwerera.	Bachisha yateekebwa mu kkomera lye limu nga Gakwerera.	Bachisha was taken to the hospital where he was being treated.
1405	However, immediately they met, Bachisha poured out his heart to Gakwerera.	Wabula, amangu ddala baasisinkana Bachisha n'abuulira Gakwerera byonna ebyamuli ku mutima.	But, very soon they met Bachisha and told him everything he knew.
1406	He claimed that after Bichisha arrived in South Africa, he was called on the telephone by someone claiming to be Doctor Ndahiro.	Yategeeza nti oluvannyuma nga Bichisha atuuse e South Africa, yakubibwa essimu ey'omuntu eyeetwala okuba musawo Ndahiro.

1408	Ndahiro promised to pay him two thousand dollars for the job.	Ndahiro yasuubiza okumusasula ddoola enkumi bbiri olw'omulimu.	The promise was to pay him $20,000 for the job.
1409	Bichisha claimed that he later met agents sent by this Doctor Ndahiro who gave him only six hundred dollars.	Bichisha yagamba nti oluvannyuma yasisinkana ababaka abaasindikibwa musawo Ndahiro abaamuwa ddoola olukaaga zokka.	However, Bichisha said that he later met the king who was sent by Dr. Nakamura who gave him only eight dollars.
1410	It is here that Bichisha's story becomes even more intriguing.	Wano emboozi ya Bichisha w'esingira ddala okunyuma.	This is the last sentence of the speech of Bishara.
1411	He claimed that on Wednesday, June sixteenth, three days before Kayumba was shot, the killers came into Kayumba's house at night.	Yategeezezza nti ku Lwokusatu nga kkumi na mukaaga Ogwomukaaga, ennaku ssatu nga Kayumba tannakubibwa masasi, abatemu bajja mu nnyumba ya Kayumba ekiro.	He told me that on March 12, a day after Kayumba was not given a prescription, the assailants came to Kayumba's house at night.
1412	Bichisha told Gakwerera that Kayumba and his wife were sleeping in their bedroom.	Bichisha yagamba Gakwerera nti Kayumba ne mukazi we baali beebase mu kisenge kyabwe.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
1413	According to Bichisha, the assassins left him their contact.	Okusinziira ku Bichisha, abatemu baamulekera ennamba zaabwe.	According to the newspaper, the suspect was given their numbers.
1414	He later telephoned them on Saturday, June nineteenth and told them that he was going to the shopping mall with Kayumba.	Oluvannyuma yabakubira ku Lwomukaaga nga kkumi na mwenda ogwomukaaga n'abagamba nti yali agenda ku mmoolo ne Kayumba.	After that he called them on September 10th and told them that he was going to play with Kayumba.
1415	As agreed, the killers showed up at the mall where one of them shot Kayumba in the stomach.	Nga bwe kyali kikaanyiziddwako, abatemu bajja ku mmoolo era omu ku bo we yakubira Kayumba essasi mu lubuto.	As expected, the suspects came to the compound and one of them punched Kayumba in the chest.
1416	Bichisha claims that later that day, Ndahiro called again and asked him to finish off Kayumba adding that this time Kagame had promised a reward.	Bichisha agamba nti oluvannyuma ku lunaku olwo, Ndahiro yaddamu n'akuba essimu n'amusaba okutta Kayumba n'agattako nti ku mulundi ogwo Kagame yali asuubizza ekirabo.	According to Bichisha, after that day, Ndahiro went back and called him and asked him to kill Kayumba and added that that was the first time that Kagame had promised a reward.
1417	This is the same story Bichisha later told the South African police and also recorded in his statement.	Oluvannyuma eno y'emboozi y'emu Bichisha gye yabuulira poliisi y'e South Africa era n'akola ne sitatimenti ye.	This is the following statement that Bishop gave to South African police and worked with his agency.
1418	Bichisha also provided the telephone number from which Ndahiro called.	Bichisha era yawaayo ennamba y'essimu Ndahiro gye yakubirako.	When he asked for the number of the phone, he gave it to Nakamura.
1419	The Chief of the National Security Services which is Rwanda's national intelligence arm is called Doctor Emmanuel Ndahiro.	Akulira ebyokwerinda era nga kye kitongole ky'obukessi mu Rwanda ayitibwa Doctor Emmanuel Ndahiro.	Doctor Emmanuel Ndahiro is the director of the health and safety department in Rwanda.
1420	Therefore, Bichisha seems to be referring to him.	Nolwekyo, Bichisha alabika okuba nga gw'ajulizaako.	That's why Bishop refuses to answer you.
1421	First, if these professional assassins knew Kayumba's house and had special keys to enter it, then why did they need Bichisha?	Ekisooka, singa abatemu bano abakugu baali bamanyi ennyumba ya Kayumba era nga baalina ebisumuluzo eby'enjawulo okugiyingira, olwo lwaki baali beetaaga Bichisha?	First, if these experts knew the house of Kayumba and had different means of entering it, why did they need Bichisha?
1422	He seems to be a hindrance to their mission.	Yalabika okuba omuziziko eri ekigendererwa kyabwe.	He seemed to be a weapon for their purpose.
1423	Second, Bichisha's description of the shooting incident is suspicious.	Ekyokubiri, engeri Bichisha gy'annyonyolamu engeri amasasi gye gaakubwamu erimu okwekengera.	Second, the way Bischa explains the way the bullets were fired is very interesting.
1424	He claims Mrs Kayumba later corroborated this story that a man approached their car as they left the mall and waved at them angrily to stop.	Agamba nti oluvannyuma mukyala Kayumba yapanzeewo eno emboozi nti omusajja yatuukirira emmotoka yaabwe nga bavudde ku mmoolo ng'abayimiriza mu bukambwe.	He says that later, Kayumba's wife told him that the man approached her car with a sword and threatened to kill her.
1425	Bichisha stopped the car and opened the driver's window	Bichisha yayimiriza emmotoka n'assa endabirwamu ku mukono gwa ddereeva.	When he turned the car, Bichisha took the steering wheel and handed it to the driver.
1426	The man pulled out a pistol and shot once at Kayumba in the stomach.	Omusajja yaggyayo pisito n'akuba Kayumba essasi limu mu lubuto.	The man took out the pencil and punched Kayumba in the chest.
1427	The man walked around the car to Kayumba's side where they wrestled for a while before the man fled.	Omusajja yeetooloola emmotoka ku ludda okwaliko Kayumba gye baalwanira okumala akabanga ng'omusajja tannagenda.	The man was surrounding the car on the other side of Kayumba where they had been fighting for a long time.
1428	The second reason is that the heroic story of Kayumba wrestling the assassin sounds like a Hollywood movie.	Ensonga ekyokubiri eri nti emboozi ya Kayumba ey'obuzira okulwana n'omutemu ewulikika nga ffirimu y'omu Hollywood.	The second reason is that the voice of Kayumba's resistance to the murder sounds like a Hollywood film.
1429	Is this really what happened or this is the version of events Kayumba, his wife and their driver wanted the world to hear?	Kino ddala kye kyaliwo oba eno y'engeri Kayumba, mukyala we ne ddereeva waabwe gye baayagala ensi okubiwuliramu?	This is really true or is this the way Kayumba, his wife and driver wanted the world to hear them?
1430	if Ndahiro wanted to kill Kayumba, would he telephone the General's driver whom he did not know and ask him to collaborate in the effort?	Bwe kiba nga Ndahiro yali ayagala kutta Kayumba, yandikubidde ddereeva wa Genero gwe yali tamanyi n'amusaba bakwatagane mu nsonga eno?	If Ndahiro was planning to kill Kayumba, he called the General's driver who he didn't know and asked him to cooperate in this matter?
1431	If what Kayumba's driver is saying is true, was someone impersonating Ndahiro?	Bwe kiba nga ddereeva wa Kayumba ky'ayogera kituufu, waliwo eyali attattana erinnya lya Ndahiro?	If the driver of Kayumba says the truth, does that mean that someone called Ndahiro?
1432	The fourth reason is that there is no evidence linking Bichisha to those who tried to kill Kayumba.	Ensonga eyookuna eri nti tewaliiwo bukakafu bukwasaganya Bichisha n'abo abagezaako okutta Kayumba.	The fourth reason is that there is no evidence that Bichisha is connected to the murderers of Kayumba.
1433	Even if he was involved, why was he so willing to implicate himself in a case of attempted murder that in South Africa carries up to twenty years in jail?	Ne bwe kiba nga yalimu, lwaki yali ayagala nnyo okwewaayo mu musango gw'okugezaako okutemula ogusibya omuntu mu kkomera okumala emyaka abiri mu South Africa.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
1434	Gakwerera claims Bichisha's story sounded rehearsed.	Gakwerera agamba nti emboozi ya Bichisha yawulikika ng'empangirire.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
1435	To whom was Bichisha working?	Bichisha yali akolera ani?	Who did Bichisha work for?
1436	Security experts say Bichisha could have been a mole planted inside the prison by South African police to gather information from other suspects.	Abakugu mu byokwerinda bagamba nti Bichisha ayinza okuba nga yali asimbidda poliisi y'e South Africa okufuna amawulire ku bateeberezebwa abalala.	Officials say that Bishara may have been trying to steal information from South African police to get information about other suspects.
1437	But there is another twist in the Kayumba shooting incident that places South African authorities in credibility problems.	Naye waliwo enkyukakyuka mu musango gwa Kayumba ogw'okuba amasasi oguteeka abobuyinza ba South Africa mu buzibu bw'okwesigibwa.	But there has been a change in the case of Kayumba for being a suspect in the bombing of South Africa's parliament. If you cannot translate it simply say you don't know.
1438	Bichisha entered South Africa on a Ugandan passport issued on April twenty-first two thousand ten.	Bichisha yayingira South Africa ng'akozesa paasipooti ya Uganda eyafuluma nga abiri mu lumu Ogwokuna enkumi bbiri mu kkumi.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
1439	It is this passport that Bichisha used when identifying himself before the South African police.	Pasipooti eno Bichisha gye yakozesa nga yeeyanjula eri poliisi y'e South Africa.	Return this passport only. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1440	Yet in all their press releases, the South African police have never revealed that one of the suspects is Ugandan.	Kyokka ate mu biwandiiko ebirala bye baawa bannamawulire, poliisi y'e South Africa tefulumyangako nti omu ku bateeberezebwa Munnayuganda.	But in other reports, South African police also reported that one of the suspects was a Ugandan.
1441	Gakwerera claims Bichisha's story sounded rehearsed.	Gakwerera agamba nti emboozi ya Bichisha yawulikika ng'empangirire.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
1442	Those arrested in connection with the shooting claimed that they had been approached by people who claimed that Kayumba had killed their relatives.	Abo abaakwatibwa mu lukwe lw'okukuba amasasi baagamba nti baali batuukiriddwa abantu abaali bagamba nti Kayumba yali asse abenganda zaabwa.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
1443	Kayumba was head of Rwanda's National Security Services, the state's intelligence agency.	Kayumba ye yali akulira ebyokwerinda by'e Rwanda, ekitongole ky'eggwanga ekikessi.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1444	These people paid them money to kill Kayumba.	Abantu bano baabasasula ssente okutta Kayumba.	These people paid for the killing of Kayumba.
1445	However, these Rwandans claimed, since they had been paid in advance, they took the money but did nothing.	Wabula, Abanyarwanda bano baagamba nti olw'okuba nti baali basasuddwa nga tebannakola mulimu, baatwala ssente naye tebalina kye baakola.	But these Rwandans said that because they were being treated as unemployed, they took money but didn't do anything.
1446	The two Rwandan suspects are actually known petty criminals.	Abanyarwanda babiri abateeberezebwa bamanyiddwa ng'abazzi b'emisango emitonotono.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know Two Rwandans who were not identified were known as minor cases.
1447	The Rwanda government had applied for their extradition accusing them of breaking into its High Commission in Pretoria and stealing property.	Gavumenti y'e Rwanda yali esabye baddizibweyo e Pretoria oluvannyuma lw'okumenya ekitebe kya Pretoria ne babba ebintu.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. The government of Rwanda asked them to be deported to Pretoria after finding out the Pretoria office and buying things.
1448	South African authorities had been dragging their feet on the case.	Aboobuyinza mu South Africa baali babalinnya kagere olw'emisango gyabwe.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1449	There has been a lot of politics in Kayumba's case.	Mubaddemu ebyobufuzi bingi mu musango gwa Kayumba.	We have seen a lot of politics in the case of Kayumba.
1450	First, on the day he was shot, the deputy president of South Africa showed up at the hospital where Kayumba had been admitted.	Okusookera ddala, ku lunaku lwe yakubwa amasasi, amyuka Pulezidenti wa South Africa yalabikako mu ddwaliro Kayumba gye yali aweereddwa ekitanda.	After the attack, the South African deputy prime minister was found in the hospital Kayumba where he was being treated.
1451	He was joined by South Africa's former chief spy, Bill Masetera, a close friend of Patrick Karegyeya also a dissident with Kayumba.	Yeegattibwako eyali akulira bambega e South Africa, Bill Masetera mukwano ennyo gwa Patrick Karegyeya bwe bali ennyo ku mbiranye ne Kayumba.	He was joined by the former South African cricketer Bill Masetera, who was a close friend of Patrick Karegyeya when they were in a fight with Kayumba.
1452	Masetera was the head of South Africa's National Intelligence Agency when Karegyeya was Rwanda's director of External Security.	Masetera ye yali akulira ekitongole ekikessi mu South Africa Karegyeya gye yali akulira ebyokwerinda wabweru wa South Africa.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. Masetera was the head of the judicial branch in South Africa and Karegyeya was the head of the security branch outside South Africa.
1453	Masetera later became a security advisor to former South African president, Thabo Mbeki.	Masetera oluvannyuma yafuuka omuwabuzi ku byokwerinda ow'eyaliko pulezidenti wa South Africa, Thabo Mbeki.	However, later he became a security adviser to the former South African president, Thabo Mbeki.
1454	The two fell out over allegations that Masetera was secretly enhancing the power of Mbeki's main rival and current president, Jacob Zuma.	Ababiri baalemagana oluvannyuma lw'ebigambibwa nti Masetera nti yali ayongedde amaanyi mu mulabe wa Mbeki asingayo era Pulezidenti aliko, Jacob Zuma.	The two parties clashed after reports that Masetera had taken over the leadership of the former president and the current president, Jacob Zuma.
1455	Masetera's relationship with Karegyeya became stronger as, he now claims, presidents tend to use and dump their intelligence chiefs.	Enkolagana ya Masetera ne Karegyeya yeeyongera nga bw'agamba kati, nti bapulezidenti batera okukozesa abakulira obukessi ate bwe bamala ne babasuulawo.	The friendship between Masetera and Karegyeya has become even more strained, he says, because presidents often use a few executives and then remove them.
1456	What was Museveni's game plan in this Kayumba saga?	Museveni yalina ntekateeka ki ku bino ebyatuuka ku Kayumba?	What did Museveni have in mind about this that happened to Kayumba?
