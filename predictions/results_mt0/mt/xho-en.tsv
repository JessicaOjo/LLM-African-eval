107	South African health officials are urging COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Aspen to keep its plant in the Eastern Cape province open.	Amagosa ezempilo eMzantsi Afrika abongoza umenzi wesitofu sokugonya i-COVID-19 i-Aspen ukuba igcine isityalo sayo sivulekile kwiphondo leMpuma Koloni.	South African health officials have ordered the producer of the COVID-19 vaccine Aspen to keep its plant open in the eastern Cape.
108	This follows a Reuters article quoting Aspens senior director saying they may have to shut down as there have been no orders for their rebranded COVID vaccine.	Oku kulandela inqaku leReuters licaphula umlawuli omkhulu wakwa-Aspens esithi kungafuneka bavale njengoko kungakhange kubekho zi-odolo zesitofu sabo sogonyo se-COVID.	This follows a Reuters report which quotes the chief executive of Aspens saying that they could close because there are no orders for their COVID-19 vaccine.
109	A South African-owned subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Aspen struck a deal with American company Johnson & Johnson in March to package, price, sell and distribute its vaccine in Africa.	Inkampani yaseMzantsi Afrika ephantsi kwenkampani enkulu samayeza i-Aspen yenze isivumelwano nenkampani yaseMelika iJohnson & Johnson ngoMatshi yokupakisha, ixabiso, ukuthengisa kunye nokusasaza isitofu sayo sokugonya e-Afrika.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. The South African company under the largest drug company Aspen signed a contract with the American Johnson & Johnson in March to package, price, sell and distribute its tuberculosis vaccine in Africa.
110	This vaccine was rebranded as Aspenovax.	Esi sitofu sathiywa ngokutsha njenge-Aspenovax.	If you can't translate this drug simply say you don't know.
111	The move was hailed by many as there had been much concern about Africas reliance on imported vaccines which were often costly and at times in short supply.	Eli nyathelo liye lanconywa ngabaninzi njengoko bekukho inkxalabo enkulu malunga nokuxhomekeka kweAfrika kumayeza ogonyo asuka kumazwe angaphandle ebesoloko eneendleko kwaye ngamanye amaxesha enqongophele.	This step has been praised by many as there was a great concern about the dependence of Africa on imported medicines that were often expensive and sometimes unreliable.
112	But there have been no orders for Aspenovax.	Kodwa akukhange kubekho ziodolo ze-Aspenovax.	But there were no orders for Aspenovx.
113	South Africas National Health Department Spokesperson Foster Mohale said the lack of orders is due to low vaccination rates not only at home, but globally.	Isithethi seSebe lezeMpilo kuzwelonke eMzantsi Afrika uFoster Mohale uthe ukunqongophala kwee-odolo kungenxa yamazinga aphantsi okugonya kungekuphela nje ekhaya, kodwa kwihlabathi jikelele.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The South African Health Minister Foster Mohale said the lack of orders was due to low levels of infection not only in the country but across the world.
114	Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production. 	“Ukuthandabuza kugonyo yenye yezinto ezinegalelo kula mazinga aphantsi ogonyo okanye imfuno yogonyo engaphezulu echaphazela imveliso.	"""The fear of safety is one of the factors that contribute to the low levels of safety or the higher levels of safety that affect the product."
115	Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low.	Kuba ngokucacileyo siyaqonda ukuba abakwishishini, abakwazi ukuqhubeka bevelisa izitofu zokugonya xa besazi ukuba imfuno yogonyo iphantsi kakhulu.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know because we clearly understand that the businesses cannot continue to produce vaccines when they know that the vaccination requirement is very low.
116	"So, we understand the situation where they are, and we sympathize with them,"" he said."	Ke, siyayiqonda imeko abakuyo, kwaye siyavelana nabo,” utshilo.	"But we understand their situation, and we are willing to deal with them,"" he said."
117	Mohale said for now, South Africa has enough vaccines.	UMohale uthe okwangoku, uMzantsi Afrika unezitofu ezaneleyo.	Mohale said that at this time South Africa has enough medicine.
118	He adds that in March, 100,000 vaccines expired.	Wongeza ngelithi ngoMatshi, amayeza ogonyo ayi-100,000 aphelelwe lixesha.	In March, 100,000 prescription medications were exhausted.
119	And more are due to expire in June and July.	Kwaye ngaphezulu kulindeleke ukuba ziphelelwe ngoJuni nangoJulayi.	And more expected to be finished in June and July.
120	However, he said that Aspens vaccine plant is important because no one knows what the future holds.	Nangona kunjalo, uthe isityalo sokugonya i-Aspens sibalulekile kuba akukho mntu waziyo ukuba ikamva lisiphathele ntoni.	But he said that the importance of the shepherd's sheep is because no one knows what the future will bring.
121	We will try to engage them not to rush their decision precisely because we anticipate especially our scientists, our epidemiologists, we anticipate that the fifth wave might hit the country, South Africa, during the winter season which is a few weeks away from now. 	Siza kuzama ukuthetha nabo ukuba bangasingxameli isigqibo sabo ngokuchanekileyo kuba silindele izazinzulu zethu, iingcali zethu zezifo, ukuba iliza lesihlanu lingabetha ilizwe loMzantsi Afrika ngexesha lasebusika elisele kwiiveki ezimbalwa ukusuka ngoku.	We will try to talk to them to make sure they don't make a mistake because we are waiting for our scientists, our experts, to announce that the fifth ebola virus could hit South Africa in the winter which is coming in a few weeks.
122	"As you can see the number of daily COVID-19 patients has been rising for the past seven days,"" he said."	Njengoko ubona inani lezigulana ze-COVID-19 zemihla ngemihla zinyuka kwezi ntsuku zisixhenxe zidlulileyo,”utshilo.

123	Professor Petro Terblanche, who is the managing director of South African company, Afrigen, which in a continent-first made an mRNA COVID vaccine using Modernas data — said the situation at Aspen is a tragedy for the industry.	Unjingalwazi uPetro Terblanche, ongumlawuli wenkampani yaseMzantsi Afrika, i-Afrigen, ethe kwilizwekazi lokuqala yenza isitofu sokugonya i-mRNA COVID isebenzisa Idatha yeModernas - uthe imeko yase-Aspen yintlekele kwishishini.	Dr. Petro Terblanche, a chief executive of South African company Afrigen, who says the first country in the world to make a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine using Modernas data - said the Aspen situation was a disaster for the business.
124	This is just indicating again how important it is that this continent looks at policy reform. 	“Oku kubonisa kwakhona indlela ekubaluleke ngayo ukuba eli lizwekazi lijonge uhlengahlengiso lomgaqo-nkqubo.	This also shows how important it is for the continent to look at reforms. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
125	This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies.	Oku kumalunga nendlela esiza kuqinisekisa ngayo ukuba sinikezela ngokukhethekileyo kwiinkampani zasekhaya.	This is about how we will ensure that we provide exclusively to local companies.
126	How are we going to make sure that we create a marketplace and eco-system that will absorb local capacity?	Siza kuqinisekisa njani ukuba sivelisa indawo yokuthengisa kunye ne-nkqubo yendalo eya kuthatha umthamo wasekhaya?	How can we ensure that we produce a market and a natural system that will take the capacity of the home?
127	"Otherwise, we will not have capacity locally in a sustainable manner and were going to get the next pandemic and we will be unprepared, and we will not have health security,"" said Terblanche."	Ngaphandle koko, asiyi kuba nomthamo wasekhaya ngendlela ezinzileyo kwaye siyakufumana ubhubhane olandelayo sibe singalungiselelanga, kwaye asiyi kuba nokhuseleko lwezempilo, ”utshilo uTerblanche.	"If not, we will not have a stable home quarantine and we will face a second outbreak without being prepared, and we will not have health protection,"" Terblanche said."
128	She believes money should also be put into educating people on the importance of vaccines.	Ukholelwa ukuba imali kufuneka ifakwe ekufundiseni abantu ngokubaluleka kwezitofu zokugonya.	He believes that money should be spent on teaching people the importance of vaccines.
129	We need to ensure that we also put effort into advocacy for vaccination. 	“Kufuneka siqinisekise ukuba sikwabeka iinzame zokuxhasa ugonyo.	We need to make sure we also make efforts to support the economy.
130	Because we now have 17% of the continent that is vaccinated.	Kaloku ngoku sine-17% yelizwekazi eligonyiweyo.	Now we have 17% of the world covered in waste.
131	"We need to get them to at least 40% to ensure that we fully arrest this pandemic,"" she said."

205	"The result should be more ""predictability,"" said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules ""take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."""	"Isiphumo kufuneka sibe ngakumbi ""ukuqikelelwa,"" utshilo u-Abdullah Alaoudh, ingcali yezomthetho esekwe e-US kunye nomgxeki karhulumente, njengoko imithetho emitsha ""isusa kwi-leeway ... ababenayo abagwebi."""	"If you cannot translate simply say you don't know The result should be more ""predictable,"" said Abdullah Alaoudh, a US lawyer and government critic, as the new laws ""remove the leeway... which the judges had."""
206	"But tighter regulation by the monarchy also ""creates a larger problem: lack of independence,"" he added."	"Kodwa ukulawulwa okungqongqo kobukhosi nako ""kudala ingxaki enkulu: ukungabikho kokuzimela,"" wongeze watsho."	"But the strict rule of the king also ""created a big problem: the lack of independence,"" he added."
207	The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal.	Ukumkani uyintloko yenkundla yaseSaudi kwaye usebenza njengenkundla yokugqibela yesibheno.	The King is the head of the Saudi court and works as the last court of justice.
208	Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar.	Utata ka-Alaoudh, umfundisi odumileyo uSalman al-Awdah, ubanjiwe ukusukela ngo-2017, ebonakala ngathi uyaziphindezela ngeposti ye-Twitter eyayingqubana nomgaqo-nkqubo waseSaudi Arabia ngexesha lokuhlukaniswa kweQatar.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. The father of Alaoudh, a famous teacher, has been detained since 2017, appearing to be repeating a tweet that clashed with the Saudi policy during the Qatari separation.
209	He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power.	Ungomnye wabaninzi ababanjiweyo kwingxaki ecacileyo yokuchasa kunye nabo banokucela umngeni kumandla kaNkosana uMohammed.	He is one of many suspects in a clearly defined opposition and can challenge the authority of King Mohammed.
210	One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession.	Omnye weyona mizekelo ibalaseleyo ngowayesakuba yinkosana u-Mohammed bin Nayef, umhlobo weCIA ohlonitshwa eNtshona ngeenzame zakhe zokulwa nobundlobongela obugqithileyo, kodwa ngubani owagxothwa nguKumkani uSalman kumgca wokulandelelana.	One of the most famous examples is the former king Mohammed bin Nayef, a CIA friend who is recognized in the West for his efforts to fight the recent violence, but who was fired by King Salman in the sequence.
211	Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed.	INkosana Nayef ayizange ibonwe esidlangalaleni ukususela kwiingxelo zokubanjwa kwakhe ngo-Matshi 2020. Ukuvalelwa kwakhe akuzange kuqinisekiswe ngokusemthethweni.	The king was not seen publicly since the reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was not confirmed officially.
212	For government opponents, such cases reinforce questions about what difference the ongoing justice reforms will make.	Kwabachasi bakarhulumente, amatyala anjalo omeleza imibuzo malunga nokuba nguwuphi na umahluko oza kwenziwa luhlaziyo lobulungisa oluqhubekayo.	For government employees, such cases raise questions about what differences will be made by continuing judicial review.
213	In my view, this is all window-dressing, said Madawi al-Rasheed, a U.K.-based academic and spokesperson for the opposition National Assembly Party founded by exiles.	“Ngokokubona kwam, konke oku kukufihla inyani,” utshilo uMadawi al-Rasheed, isifundiswa sase-UK kunye nesithethi seqela eliphikisayo leNdibano yeSizwe eyasekwa ngabathinjwa.	"""For me, all this is hiding the truth,"" said academic and spokesman for the National Conference formed by prisoners."
214	It's very, very difficult to see what the meaning is of these reforms apart from the project of portraying (Prince Mohammed) as a reformer.	Kunzima kakhulu ukubona ukuba yintoni intsingiselo yolu tshintsho ngaphandle kweprojekthi yokubonisa (uNkosana uMahammad) njengomhlaziyi.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know It is very difficult to understand what this change means without the project to show (King Muhammad) as a prophet.
215	Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.	Ukuxhoma kuyo nayiphi na ingxoxo yobulungisa kunye nohlaziyo lwezomthetho eSaudi Arabia kukubulawa kunye nokunqunyulwa komgxeki kunye nombhali wemihlathi uJamal Khashoggi kwi-consulate yase-Istanbul yobukumkani ngo-2018.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. The focal point of any judicial and legal debate in Saudi Arabia is the killing and execution of the journalist and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Crown Consulate of Istanbul in 2018.
216	"A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself ""approved"" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a ""rogue"" operation."	"Uvavanyo lwe-intelligence yase-US yafumanisa ukuba iNkosana uMohammed ngokwakhe ""wavuma"" umsebenzi wokubamba okanye ukubulala uKhashoggi, nangona izikhulu zaseSaudi ziphika oku kwaye zisithi ""ngumsebenzi okhohlakeleyo""."	"The US intelligence investigation found that the King Mohammed himself ""agreed"" to the operation of holding or killing Khashoggi, even though Saudi officials deny this and say it is ""a dirty job""."
217	In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia.	Ngo-Epreli, ngaphambi kokuba uMongameli waseTurkey u-Recep Tayyip Erdogan atyelele i-Riyadh ngoLwesine waza wamkela iNkosana uMohammed, iTurkey yadlulisela ityala ngokungabikho kwabarhanelwa abayi-26 kwimeko yaseKhashoggi eSaudi Arabia.	In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and welcomed the Duke of Mohammed, Turkey filed a charge of failure to bring 26 suspects to trial in the case of Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia.
218	Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiancée, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial.	Isigqibo saseTurkey sitsale uqhanqalazo olunxungupheleyo lwamagqwetha kunye nentombi kaKhashoggi, eyanyanzelisa ukuba iinkundla zaseSaudi azinakukwazi ukumisa ityala elinesihlahla.	The Turkish decision ended a passionate protest by lawyers and Khashoggi's daughter, which forced the Saudi courts to refuse to quash the murder case.
219	For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out.	Kwabo banabantu ababathandayo abavalelwa kude, ukubulawa kukaKhashoggi kunyusa uloyiko olufanayo malinga nokuthetha ngokukhululekileyo.	For those who have loved ones who are kept away, the killing of Khashoggi raises the same fears as freedom of speech.
220	I want to, many do, but we're scared, said a friend of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, who has been detained along with his father since 2018.	“Ndiyafuna, abaninzi bayayenza, kodwa siyoyika,” watsho umhlobo weNkosana uSalman bin Abdulaziz, ovalelwe noyise ukusukela ngo-2018.	"I want it, many do it, but we're afraid,"" said a friend of the Duke of Medina, who has been separated from his father since 2018."
221	Everyone knows what happened to Khashoggi.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kuKhashoggi.	All of us know what happened to Khashoggi.

396	Are COVID-19 Restrictions Stunting Children’s Immune Systems?	Ingaba izithintelo ze-COVID-19 ziyawoyisa amajoni omzimba abantwana?	Is the COVID-19 restrictions really threatening the immune system of children?
397	Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.	Ezinye iingcali zonyango zivakalise inkxalabo yokuba amanyathelo othintelo lwe-COVID-19, njengokugquma imaski kunye nokufundela emakhaya, anokuthi enze buthathaka amajoni omzimba wabantwana ngokubakhusela kwizigulo eziqhelekileyo zobuntwana.	Some health experts have expressed concern that vaccinations and home quarantine, such as covering up and washing hands, can weaken the immune system of children by protecting them from common childhood diseases.
398	There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things, says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.	Zininzi izizathu zokukholelwa ukuba abantwana kufuneka bavezwe kwizinto zokugcina amajoni emizimba yabo enamandla, ukuze ukuba bathe badibana nento eyingozi kakhulu, banamanye amajoni omzimba okunokuthi awele kwaye ancede abakhusele kwezo zinto. Utsho uSara Sawyer, unjingalwazi webhayoloji yemolekyuli, yeselula kunye nophuhliso kwiYunivesithi yaseColorado Boulder.	There are many reasons why children should be exposed to weapons to maintain their physical defense, so that if they get into something dangerous, they have other physical defense which can fall and help them protect themselves from those things. says Sara Sawyer, a biologist of molecular, cell and development at the University of Colorado Boulder.
399	At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.	Ekuzalweni, iintsana ezisesichengeni zifumana izilwa-buhlungu ezisuka kunina kubisi lwebele, oluzinceda luzikhusele de zibe nokwakha owazo amajoni omzimba.	Return only if you can't translate.

400	Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up.	Akuyongozi ukuba iintsana ziqalise ukubeka izinto emilonyeni yazo ngokukhawuleza nje ukuba zizuze ubugcisa obaneleyo bokuthatha izinto.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. It's not dangerous for children to start putting things in their mouths as soon as they get the right skills to take things.
401	They're doing that because they're sampling the environment and building their immunity. 	“Bayenza loo nto ngenxa yokuba bavavanya imekobume kwaye bakha amajoni omzimba.	They do that because they are testing the chemistry and building muscles.
402	"That's an evolutionary trait,"" Sawyer says."	Luphawu lokutshintsha kwezinto,” utshilo uSawyer.	"""This is a sign of change,"" said Sawyer."
403	Theyre exposing their body to germs in a certain, level way to build their immunity. 	“Baveza imizimba yabo kwiintsholongwane ngendlela ethile, ekumgangatho wokwakha amajoni emizimba yabo.	"""They expose their bodies to infections in a way that is comparable to the level of their body defense."
404	"So, some people would argue that childhood illnesses, like colds and stomach bugs, build our immunity so that when more dangerous things come along, we're prepared and we don't get as sick from those more dangerous things."""	"Ngoko ke, abanye abantu banokuthi izigulo zobuntwana, ezinjengokubanda kunye nesisu, zakha amajoni omzimba ukuze xa kuvela izinto eziyingozi ngakumbi, sizilungiselele kwaye singaguli ngenxa yezo zinto ziyingozi."""	"So, some people may think that childhood diseases, such as cold and fever, build up a body immune system so that when a more dangerous situation comes, we can prepare and avoid getting sick."""
405	Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.	Ngaphambi kwesifo sikazwelonke, ubungqina be-epidemiology bacebisa ukuba abantwana abakumazwe aphuhlileyo, apho ukuhlanjwa kwezandla kunye nokusetyenziswa kwesicoci sezifo kuxhaphake kakhulu, banokuba namajoni omzimba angaphuhlisiyo xa kuthelekiswa nabantwana abakumazwe asakhasayo abasoloko bedibana neebhaktheriya ezininzi, iintsholongwane kunye nezinto ezinokuthi zenzeke.	Before the global epidemic, epidemiological evidence suggests that children in developing countries, where hand sanitization and the use of a vaccine is widely used, have a weaker immune system compared to children in developing countries who are often exposed to many bacteria, infections, and potentially harmful substances.
406	"This makes kids in more industrialized countries more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases, according to whats known as the ""hygiene hypothesis."""	"Oku kwenza abantwana kumazwe ahambela phambili kwezoqoqosho babe sesichengeni sokuphuhlisa izifo ezizimelayo, ezaziwa ngokuba yi ""hygiene hypothesis."""	"This makes children in developed economies at risk of developing a genetic infection, called the ""hygiene hypothesis."""
407	The hygiene hypothesis is actually quite controversial because it's thought that our exposure to microbes isn't the only factor, says Cody Warren, a virologist and immunologist who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder.	“IHygiene Hyphothesis eneneni iyaxabanisa kuba kucingelwa ukuba ukudibana kwethu neentsholongwane ayisiyiyo yodwa into,” utshilo uCody Warren, ugqirha wentsholongwane kunye nogcino lwamajoni omzimba osebenza  kwiYunivesithi yaseColorado Boulder.	"If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. ""The Hygiene Hyphothesis is really confusing because we think that our contact with bacteria is not the only thing,"" said Cody Warren, a doctor of infection and body hygiene at the University of Colorado Boulder."
408	A lot of this could also be dictated by genetics, diet, and the environment that we live in. 	“Uninzi lwale nto lunokuchazwa lufuzo, ukutya, kunye nendawo esihlala kuyo.	"""Most of this can be explained by genetics, food, and where we live."

411	Warren, the father of three young children, says spending lots of time outdoors is one way to balance the negatives of isolation.	UWarren, utata wabantwana abathathu abancinci, uthi ukuchitha ixesha elininzi ngaphandle yenye yeendlela zokulinganisa izinto ezingalunganga zokuba wedwa.	Warren, a father of three young children, says spending a lot of time alone is one of the ways to calculate the bad things of being alone.
412	Just exploring microbes in the environment also is benefiting [and] training our immune system, Warren says.	“Ukuphonononga nje iintsholongwane kwindawo esingqongileyo kuluncedo [kwaye] nokuqeqesha amajoni ethu omzimba,” utshilo uWarren.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
413	Our immune systems get trained through the foods that we eat, which also have microorganisms on them. 	“Amajoni ethu omzimba aqeqeshwa ngokutya esikutyayo, okunezinto ezincinci esingaziboniyo kuko.	"""Our bodies are trained by the food we eat, which has small things that we don't see."

There are other things parents can do to strengthen their immune system during a pandemic, he says.
416	One of the most important things you can do is just to stay up to date on vaccines. 	“Enye yezona zinto zibalulekileyo onokuthi uzenze kukuhlala usexesheni ngezitofu zokugonya.	One of the most important things you can do is to stay in bed with a prescription medication.

418	But also, equally important is making sure our children have a good diet and they regulate stress. 	Kodwa kwakhona, okubaluleke ngokulinganayo kukuqinisekisa ukuba abantwana bethu banokutya okufanelekileyo kwaye balawula uxinzelelo.	But, as well, the most important thing is to ensure that our children have the right diet and control stress.
419	"It's been well documented that both of those — having a good diet, a less stressful environment — can have a positive impact on our immune system."""

420	Once public health officials say masks are no longer necessary, Sawyer thinks pointing out the positives of putting our masks away could reassure hesitant parents who worry about their children getting sick.	Nje ukuba amagosa ezempilo karhulumente athi iimaski azisafuneki, uSawyer ucinga ukuba ukukhomba izinto ezintle zokubeka iimaski zethu kunokuqinisekisa abazali abathandabuzayo abanexhala lokugula kwabantwana babo.	Since government health officials say the masks are no longer needed, Sawyer thinks that showing the good things about keeping our masks would ensure parents who are worried about their children's health.
421	Maybe we should have a public conversation about the possible reasons to take that mask off, if they are in school, and get back to the normal repertoire of relatively safe childhood illnesses, she says.	“Mhlawumbi kufuneka sibe nencoko esidlangalaleni malunga nezizathu ezinokubakho zokususa lo maski, ukuba basesikolweni, kwaye sibuyele kwindawo eqhelekileyo yezigulo zobuntwana ezikhuselekileyo,” utshilo.

422	The plus side of childhood illnesses is that they can build up that hornet's nest of immunity that could protect kids aagainst new things that then come along.	Elona cala libalaseleyo lezigulo zobuntwana kukuba banokwakha indlwane ye-hornet yokungakhuseleki enokukhusela abantwana kwizinto ezintsha ezizayo.	The most interesting aspect of childhood syndrome is that they can build a barrier fence that can protect children from new things coming.
