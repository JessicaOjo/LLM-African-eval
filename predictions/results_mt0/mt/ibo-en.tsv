266	Recall that in 2015, majority of the Igbos did not vote for Buhari in the election which made him say that he would not treat those who gave him 95% support and those who gave him 5% support the same way, a statement many thought he has fulfilled through his appointments since he assumed leadership.

Remember in 2015, many Nigerians did not submit a voter registration form to Buhari, which led him to say that he did not pay the 95% of the votes and the 5% of the votes he received, a claim many Nigerians believed he had met with by the officials he appointed since he came into office.
