0	Amendments to the press and publications law restricting online expression in Jordan were passed by parliament today .	በዮርዳኖስ የፕሬስ እና ሕትመት ሕግ በበይነመረብ (Internet) ላይ ሐሳብን የመግለጽ መብትን እንዲያደግድ ተደርጎ ትላንት እንዲሻሻል ተደረገ፡፡	The newspaper and press law of Montenegro was changed yesterday to recognize the right to express opinions on the Internet.
1	Simultaneously a demonstration was held by activists and journalists in front of the parliament as a majority of MP's voted for the bill.	በተመሳሳይ ሰዓት ሕጉን ከሚያፀድቁበት ፓርላማ ፊት ለፊት ጋዜጠኞች እና የነፃ ሐሳብ አራማጆች ሰላማዊ ሰልፍ ወጥተዋል፡፡	Also at the same time, journalists and freedom activists took a protest outside the parliament ahead of the vote.
2	An improvised coffin plastered with the words Freedom of the Internet was carried by activists signalling the anticipated death of the Internet in Jordan.	እንደመሪ ቃል የበይነመረብ ነፃነት የሚል ባነር የያዙት በነፃ ሐሳብን የመግለጽ መብት አራማጆች በዮርዳኖስ የበይነመረብን ሞት አዝማሚያ ጠቁመዋል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
3	Participants wore black to the funeral-themed demonstration.	የበይነመረብ ቀብር ለተባለለት ለዚህ አዋጅ ሰልፈኞቹ ጥቁር ልብስ ለብሰው ነበር፡፡	If you can't translate this simply say you don't know.
4	The approved law must still receive ratification from the upper house of parliament as well as approval by King Abdullah II, who retains supreme authority and whose signature is the seal of approval to all legislative matters.	የፀደቀው ሕግ አሁንም በሥራ ላይ ለመዋል፣ የላዕላይ ፓርላማውን ፈቃድ እና ሕጎች ሁሉ በዮርዳኖስ በተግባር ላይ ከመዋላቸው በፊ የሚያስፈልጋቸው የዳግማዊ ንጉሥ አብዱላህን ፊርማን ይጠብቃል፡፡	The approved law still needs to be approved by the highest parliament and the king's signature before it can be applied to the islands of the Jordan.
5	Member of Parliament, Jamil Nimri, who voted against the bill, in addition to the head of the journalists syndicate, attended the protest and claimed that such laws serve only to restrict freedoms and muffle the voices of the people.	ጀሚል ኒመሪ የተባሉ፣ አዋጁን የተቃወሙ የፓርላማ አባል፣ አዋጁን ከመቃወምም ባሻገር ሰልፉ ላይም ተሳትፈዋል፡፡	Jamie Nimar, a member of the parliament who opposed the bill, also participated in the protest.
6	It requires the owners of websites to register with the government and obtain a license, just like any other publication.”	እንደርሳቸው አባባል እንዲህ ዓይነት አዋጆች ነፃነትን በመገደብ የሕዝቦችን ድምጽ ብቻ ለማፈን ይጠቅማሉ፡፡	According to him, such laws only serve to limit freedoms by restricting the voice of the people.
7	Owners of websites will also be made responsible for the content of comments published by readers on their sites.	የድረአምባዎች ባለቤቶች አንባቢዎቸው ድረአምባዎቻቸው ላይ ለሚለጥፏቸው አስተያየቶች ሳይቀር ኃላፊነቱን ይወስዳሉ፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
8	Outrage over the proposed law has been simmering for a while and netizens had already staged an online campaign to draw attention to the new law and its repercussions.	በረቂቅ አዋጁ ላይ ከፍተኛ ተቃውሞ የተነሳበት ሲሆን፣ ወዲያውም በመረብዜጎች (netizens) ሚያስከትለው ጦስ ዙሪያ ትኩረትን ለመሳብ በሚል የመስመር ላይ እንቅስቃሴን አስጀምሯል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
9	On Twitter, netizens expressed their dismay at such a bill.	በትዊተር ላይ፣ የመረብ ዜጎች ብስጭታቸውን በጽሑፍ ገልጸዋል፡፡	In Twitter, a group of Persian citizens expressed their anger in a letter. If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
10	The beginning of the Internet freedom funeral in front of the Jordanian Parliament.	የበይነመረብ ነፃነት ቀብር አጀማመር በዮርዳኖስ ፓርላማ ፊት ለፊት፡፡	The funeral of Internet freedom was held in front of the parliament of Greece.
11	Photograph shared by Mohamed Al Qaq on Twitter	ፎቶግራፉ የተገኘው ከሞሐመድ አል ቃድ ትዊተር ላይ ነው፡፡	Photo was taken from Mohamed Al-Khad's Twitter account.

34	Activists launched a petition on Avaaz.com under the title Save the internet, which called on King Abdullah II, the minister of information and members of parliament to repeal the amendments to the press and publications law.	com ላይ በይነመረብን አድን በሚል ዳግማዊ ንጉሥ አብዱላህ፣ የመረጃ ሚኒስትር እና የፓርላማ አባላት በፕሬስ እና ሕትመት ሕጉ ማሻሻይ ላይ ድጋሚ እንዲያስቡ የሚጠይቅ ፊርማ ማሰባሰብ ተጀምሯል፡፡	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
35	Human Rights Watch also published a report on the latest bill passed by the parliament and the restrictions that are to be imposed on Jordanian websites, titled Jordan: Moves to Censor Online Expression.	ሒዩማን ራይትስ ዋች በበኩሉ፣ በዮርዳኖሳውያን ድረአምባዎች ላይ ዕቀባ ለመጣል የፓርላማውን ይሁንታ ባገኘው አዋጅ ዙሪ ያ ዮርዳኖስ፤ በመስመር ላይ ሐሳብን የመግለፅ መብትን ቀድሞ ወደመመርመር እየሄደች ነው  የሚል ሪፖርት አውጥቷል፡፡	Freedom of Information says, however, that Syria is going to scrutinize online speech rights before it can be enforced by the parliament.
36	The Union Women and Child Development Ministry in India is considering a draft bill which, if passed by parliament, would make it legally compulsory for husbands to pay out a portion of their monthly income to their homemaker wives, for doing household chores.	የህንድ የሴቶችና ሕፃናት ሕብረት ዕድገት ሚኒስቴር ያወጣው ረቂቅ አዋጅ በፓርላማው ከፀደቀ፣ ሚስቶች በቤት ውስጥ ለሚሰሩት ሥራ ባሎች ውጪ ሰርተው ከሚያገኙት ውስጥ የተወሰነ መጠን ለሚስቶቻቸው እንዲከፍሉ የሚያስገድድ ይሆናል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The Women's and Children's Union of India's Development Ministry has published a draft bill that will require husbands to pay a portion of the income they earn from work outside of the house.
37	As per the Ministry's proposal, a model is being framed which will allow for valuation of the work done by homemakers in economic terms and then recognition of this contribution to the economy by compensating homemakers for their labour.	በሚኒስቴሩ ዕቅድ መሰረት፣ ሚስቶች በቤት ውስጥ የሚሰሩት ስራ ዋጋ የሚለካበት ሞዴል የተዘጋጀ ሲሆን፣ በዚሁ መሰረት የቤት ውስጥ ሥራ የሚሰሩትን ሰዎችና ሥራቸው ለኢኮኖሚው ያለውን ተዋፅዖ ዕውቅና መስጠት ይቻላል፡፡	In accordance with the Ministry's plan, a model has been developed to determine the cost of household work for women, which can be used to determine the contribution of women to the economic growth.
38	The proposed law is expected to refer to homemakers as home engineers.	ረቂቅ አዋጁ የቤት ውስጥ ሥራ ፈፃሚዎችን የጓዳ መሐንዲሶች በማለት ጠቅሷቸዋል፡፡	The draft law referred to contractors as landscape architects. If you cannot translate the law simply say you don't know.
39	Minister Krishna Tirath has said that this amount, which could be anywhere between 10-20% of the husband's monthly salary, should not be looked upon as salary for housework; rather it could be referred to as an honorarium or something similar.	ሚንስትር ክሪሽና ቲርታህ የክፍያው መጠን ከባሎች ወርሃዊ ገቢ ላይ ከ10-20በመቶ ሊደርስ እንደሚችል፣ ነገር ግን ሚስቶች ለቤት ውስጥ ሥራ የሚከፈላቸው መጠን ተደርጎ መወሰድ የለበትም ብለዋል፤ ይልቁንም እንደማበረታቻ ወይም ተመሳሳይ ነገር መቆጠር አለበት፡፡	Ministers Christie and Rita said the payment could be up to 20% of the income of men, but they said that it should not be considered as a reward or similar.
40	While the Minister sees this as a step forward in women's empowerment, the proposal is being debated hotly, both offline as well as online.	ሚኒስትሩ ይህንን ሴቶችን በማጠናከር ረገድ አንድ እርምጃ ወደፊት የመራመድ ያክል ይቆጥሩታል፡፡	Ministers consider this a step forward in strengthening women. If you can't translate it simply say you don't know.

43	Some feel that measuring the value of unpaid work at home is conceptually correct and well worth trying, though making it mandatory for husbands to pay out a fixed percentage of their salaries in lieu of this work may be the wrong way forward.	አንዳንዶች በቤት ውስጥ ክፍያ የማይፈፀምበትን ሥራ መለካት በፅንሰሐሳብ ደረጃ ትክክል እንደሆነ እና መሞከሩትም ተገቢ እንደሆነ  ተሰምቷቸዋል፤ ነገር ግን ባሎችን የተወሰነ መጠን ያለው ገንዘብ በየወሩ ለሚስቶቻቸው እንዲከፍሉ ማስገደዱ ግን የተሳሳተ አቀራረብ ነው ይላሉ፡፡	Some people think that determining the work that is not paid for is theoretically correct and that it is worth trying, but they say that making men pay their wives a certain amount of money each month is a mistake.
44	Others wonder how it will be possible to put a 'price tag' on all the work that goes on within a home and how such a law would be implemented - given the various questions that are sure to come up in it's wake.	ሌሎች ደግሞ በጉጉት የሚጠይቁት እያንዳንዱን የቤት ውስጥ ሥራ እንዴት ‹የዋጋ መጠን› መስጠት እና ሕጉንም እንዴት ማስፈፀም እንደሚቻል ነው - ተግባር ላይ ሲውል በርግጠኝነት ሊመጡ የሚችሉትን የተለያዩ ጥያቄዎች እያነሱ፡፡	Others are asking how to determine the cost of every home work and how to enforce the law - asking questions that are certain to come up when the law is in effect.
45	And questions are indeed being asked.	ጥያቄዎቹ በርግጥም አሁንም ተነስተዋል፡፡	However, the questions are still being asked. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
46	For example, LordRaj asks:	ለምሳሌ፣ ሎርድራጅ እንዲህ ይጠይቃል፡	"For example, Lord Richard asks, ""How can I know?"""
47	Are you suggesting an Employee / Employer relationship for the married couple?	በባለትዳሮች መካከል የተቀጣሪና/ቀጣሪ ግንኙነት ለመመስረት እየመከራችሁ ነው?	Are you advising to start a relationship between partners?
48	Who is going to decide on the working hours and job description?	የሥራውን ሰዓት እና ዝርዝር የሚወስነው ማነው?	Who decides the work schedule and details?
49	In Ground Report, which is an open news platform, D. Chaitanya outlines some further questions related to this issue that people (both men and women) appear to be hotly debating.	መሬት ላይ በወረደ ሪፖርት ዲ ቻይታንያ ከጉዳዩ ጋር በተያያዘ ሰዎች (ወንዶችና ሴቶች) በጋለ ሁኔታ እየተከራከሩ ያሉበትን ተጨማሪ ጥያቄዎችን ዝርዝር ያስቀምጣሉ፡፡	In the published report, De Schengen outlines the additional questions that are being debated by people involved (men and women) in a row.
50	For example:	ለምሳሌ፡	For example, if you can't translate, just say you don't know.
51	If in the place of wife, house-maid is discharging every day house-hold work, then how should the house-maid be treated?	በሚስቲቱ ቦታ፣ የቤት ሠራተኛዋ ሁሉንም የቤት ሥራ የመሥራት ኃላፊነት ካለባት፣ የቤት ሠራተኛይቱ እንዴት ነው የምትታየው?	In this situation, a house worker has to do all the housework, how does the house worker look?
52	Should not the house-maid be treated on par with the wife?	የቤት ሠራተኛይቱ ሚስቲቱ ማግኘት የነበረባትን ጥቅም ማግኘት የለባትም?	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
53	(In such cases) who are legitimately entitled for that 10 or 20% of amount?	(በዚህ ሁኔታ) ከ10 ወይም 20 በመቶ መጠን ያለውን ክፍያ ለመቀበል መብት ያለው ማነው?	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know (in this case) who has the right to accept a payment of 10% or 20%?
54	If 10 or 20% salary is deposited on wife’s name, what about the maintenance money to wife, if she deserts the husband and files a maintenance case on husband?	10 ወይም 20 በመቶ የሚሆነው የባልየው ደሞዝ መጠን በሚስቲቱ ስም መቀመጥ ካለበት፣ የአስቤዛውንስ ወጪ ማን ይሸፍናል?	If you can't translate simply say you don't know, who will cover the cost of the scrapbook?
55	Will this law create new financial skirmishes between wives and husbands?	ይህ ሕግ በሚስቶችና ባሎች መካከል አዲስ የገንዘብ ጦርነት አያጭርም?	This law doesn't cause a new financial war between husbands and wives?
56	Like 498-A of Penal Code, Maintenance laws, domestic violence laws, will this law also be misused by some wives?	ልክ እንደ ወንጀለኛ መቅጫ ሕጉ 498-A፣ የአስቤዛ ሕግ፣ የቤት ውስጥ ጥቃት ሕግ፣ ይሄ ሕግ በአንዳንድ ሚስቶች አላግባብ መጠቀሚያ አይሆን ይሆን?	Just like the Criminal Investigation Act 498-A, the Prisoner's Arrest Act, the Domestic Violence Act, does this law not become an unnecessary tool for some women?
57	Blogger Surya Murali too is wondering how the government proposes to implement a law such as this.	ጦማሪዋ ሱርያ ሙራሊም ይህንን ሕግ መንግስት እንዴት እንደሚተገብረው በአግራሞት ትታዘባለች፡፡	The writer, Suray Murali, is surprised to see how this law is enforced. If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
58	She says on her blog:	በጦማሯም እንዲ ትላለች:	In her blog she says that:
59	I am all for the empowerment of women, and also their financial independence... (but) my biggest question to these lawmakers is that how are they planning to implement the proposal?	ሴቶችን ማጎልበትን እደግፋለሁ፣ የገንዘብ ነፃነት እንዲኖራቸውም ጭምር… (ነገር ግን) ፍራቻዬ፣ እነዚህ ሕግ አውጪዎች ረቂቁን እንዴት ነው የሚተገብሩት?	I support women's rights, financial independence... (But) my concern is, how these legislators enforce the amendment?
60	If they go about doing it the way such that a husband shares a percentage of his income with his wife for her work, I don’t see how it makes the economic situation of the house any better or how it makes the woman independent and empowered.	ባልየው የገቢውን የተወሰነ ሽራፊ ለሚስቱ የሚያካፍል ከሆነ እንዴት የቤት ውስጥ ኢኮኖሚውን ሁኔታ እንደሚያሻሽለው እና ሴቷንም በገንዘብ ነፃነት እንዴት እንደሚያጠናክራት አይታየኝም፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. If the husband shares his income with his wife, how does he improve the home economy and how does he strengthen his wife with financial independence?
61	The gross income remaining the same, the household economy is not changed.	ድምር ገቢው ዞሮ ዞሮ አንድ ስለሚሆን በቤትውስጥ ኢኮኖሚው ላይ ለውጥ አይኖርም፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The average income is always the same so there is no change in the home economy.
62	Most responsible husbands, in my belief, would share the running costs of the household with their wives anyway… if that isn’t the case, then this sort of a scheme is not going to improve the husband-wife equation of those households.	ብዙዎቹ ኃላፊነት የሚሰማቸው ባሎች፣ የቤት ውስጥ ወጪዎችን ከሚስቶቻቸው ጋር አሁንም ቢሆን ይካፈላሉ…. ጉዳዩ የተለየ ከሆነ ደግሞ፣ ይህ ዓይነቱ መፍትሄ የባል-ሚስት የቤት ውስጥ ቀመርን አያስተካክለውም፡፡	Many responsible men still share household expenses with their wifes.... If the situation is different, this solution does not change the marriage planning.
63	At iDiva, Archana Jayakumar asks:	አርቻ ጃያኩማር በአይዲቫ ላይ ሲጠይቅ፡	"When asked in Hyderabad, Arisha Jaakumar said: ""I don't know."
64	How does all of this not make her anything but a glorified servant?	ይህ ከተከበረች የቤት ሠራተኝነት ሌላ ምንም የማያደርጋት እንዴት ነው?	How can this be done without a recognized occupation?
65	Sunita at Supari.org agrees and calls this proposed Bill as family breaking move by the government.	org ላይ ከረቂቁ ጋር በመስማማትሰበር የመንግስት ቤተሰብ ነክ እርምጃ እንደሆነ ይጠቅሳል፡፡	org says that the settlement was a government family-related action.
66	Under the guise of 'development and welfare' of women, all you have been doing is promoting a bias against men.	በሴቶች ዕድገት እና ደህንነት ጉዳይ፣ የተያያዛችሁት ነገር ቢሆን ወንዶች ላይ መዝመት ነው፡፡	If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
67	Men's rights groups tend to agree.	የወንዶች መብት ቡድንም በዚህ ይስማማል፡፡	The Women's Rights Group agrees.

69	A proposal to part with a portion of the husband’s salary and hand it over to the wife has been strongly opposed by Men’s rights groups...The ‘Save Family Foundation’ has written a letter to Krishna Tirath, Union Minister for Women and Child Development, seeking immediate withdrawal of the proposal.	የባሎችን ገቢ ቆርጦ ለሚስቶች ለመስጠት የቀረበውን ረቂቅ አዋጅ የወንዶች መብት ቡድን በከፍተኛ ሁኔታ ይቃወመዋል… ‘የቤተሰብ አድን ፋውንዴሽን’ ለሚኒስትር ክሪሽና ቲራት (የሴቶችና ሕፃናት ሕብረት ዕድገት ሚኒስቴር) ደብዳቤ ረቂቅ አዋጁ ከወዲሁ እንዲሰረዝ ደብዳቤ ጽፏል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
70	The foundation, representing around 40 different men’s organizations across the country, has termed this proposal as one-sided.	ፋውንዴሽኑ፣ በአገሪቱ ውስጥ የሚገኙ፣ ከ40 በላይ የወንዶችን ድርጅቶች በመወከል፣ ረቂቁን የአንድ ወገን ሐሳብ ሲል ፈርጆታል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
71	With such incentives, it is not surprising that many wives would rather just sit idle, and get free doles from their husbands, with the kind blessings of the Indian judicial system.	በእንደዚህ ያለ ማበረታቻ፣ በርካታ ሚስቶች በቤት ውስጥ ሥራ ፈትተው መቀመጣቸው እና ከባሎቻቸው የነፃ አሻንጉሊት መቀበላቸው የሚያስገርም ነገር አይሆንም፤ በዚህ ዓይነቱ የሕንድ የሕግ ስርዓት ቡራኬ፡፡	With such a encouragement, many women would not be surprised to leave their jobs and receive free toys from their husbands, under such a constitutional encouragement in India.
72	And all this under the guise of women empowerment	እናም ይሄ ሁሉ የሚደረገው ደግሞ ሴቶችን በማጎልበት ስም ነው፡፡	This is done in the name of encouraging women. If you cannot translate this simply say you don't know.
73	However, others are more positive to this proposal for various reasons.	ቢሆንም ግን ሌሎች ስለረቂቁ አዎንታዊ ምልከታ አላቸው፡፡	But others have positive attitudes towards the draft.
74	For example, in a discussion in the Defence Forum India, Yusuf appears pleased.	ለምሳሌ፣ የሕንድ የመከራከሪያ መድረክ ላይ በተካሔደ ውይይት ዩሱፍ ተደስቶ ታይቷል፡፡	For example, Yusof was very happy at a discussion at the Indian debate.
75	Actually this news is music to my ears.	በርግጥ ይህ ዜና ለጆሮዬ ሙዚቃ ነው፡፡	This news is really music to my ears.
76	Gives me more ways to save tax. :-)	የገቢ ግብርን ለመቀነስ ብዙ መንገዶችን ይሰጠኛል	If you can't translate it simply say you don't know.
77	Blogger Surya Murali goes on to offer, what she feels is a more practical solution to the issue, something that will truly benefit the women without getting her into the employer-employee hierarchy within the family.	ጦማሪዋ ሱራይ ሙራሊ የምትመክረው፣ ሴቷን በቤተሰብ ውስጥ ‹‹ከቀጣሪ-ተቀጣሪ›› ተዋረድ የሚያላቅቁ እና በርግጥም የሚያጠናክሩ ሌሎች የተሻሉ ተግባራዊ መፍትሄዎች እንዲቀርቡ ነው፡፡	"The writer, Suray Murali, advises that other more effective practical solutions should be offered to free the woman from the ""supervisor-supervisor"" hierarchy in the family."
78	Let the government work out a method in which they evaluate the households economically and they give the housewives / homemakers an allowance.	መንግስት ሴቶች በቤት ውስጥ የሚያበረክቱትን የኢኮኖሚ ተዋፅዖ አስልቶ ለቤት እመቤቶች/ የቤት ሠራተኞች አበል ይፍቀድላቸው፡፡	Governments should recognize the economic contribution of women in the home. If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
79	This totally skips the husband as a middleman and is a direct deal between the people who want the housewives to be empowered and the housewives.	ይህ ባሎችን ለሚስቶች መጠናከር ቀጥተኛ ተጠሪ እንዲሆኑ ከማድረግ ያድናል፡፡	This makes men less likely to be direct heirs to the wife's strength.
80	In my opinion, this would not only help the women be independent, it will also improve the general quality of life in households which otherwise manage with meager means.	በኔ አስተያየት፣ ይህ ሴቷን ከጥገኝነት ማላቀቅ ብቻ ሳይሆን የቤት ውስጥ ኢኮኖሚ ሁኔታንም ከስስት ኑሮ ያላቅቀዋል፡፡	In my opinion, this does not only free the woman from dependency but also frees the home economy from the financial slump.
81	Thus, both targets of economic upliftment and female empowerment would be achieved.	ከዚያ፣ ሁለቱም ኢኮኖሚውን የማሳደግ እና ሴቶችን የማጠናከር ሕልም ግቡን ይመታል፡፡	So, both of these dreams are going to fulfill their purposes. If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
82	InfoQueenBee agrees and adds:	ኢንፎኩዊንቢ በመስማማት የምትጨምረው፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
83	While we wait to see what happens to the Minister's proposal, it appears that the debate surrounding the question of the husband being forced to pay his house engineer an 'honorarium' for household work, is far from over.	ሕጉን ለቤት እመቤቲቱ ‹ደሞዝ› መስጠት ከማድረግ ይልቅ ለሚስቲቱ እና ልጆቹ የሕይወት፣ ሕክምና እና ኢንቨስትመንት ኢንሹራንሶች እንዲገቡላቸው ቢደነግግ መልካም ነው፡፡ የሚኒስትሩ ዕቅድ ምን እንደሚደርስ እስከምናይ ድረስ፣ ባልየው ‹‹ለጓዳዋ መሐንዲስ›› የሚያስብላት የማበረታቻ ክፍያ ጉዳይ ላይ የሚነሳው የጦፈ ክርክር ማቆሚያ አይኖረውም፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
84	Over the past few years it has become apparent that, if one has a loud enough voice and a big enough audience — not to mention a good sense of humor — social media can serve as a great platform for change.	ባለፉት ጥቂት ዓመታት አመታት ውስጥ ግልጽ ሆኗል ፤ በበቂ ሁኔታ የሚጮህ ድምጽ እና ብዙ አድማጭ ያለው አንድ ሰው ካለ (ጥሩ አሽሙርን ለመጥቀስ አይደለም) ማኀበራዊ ሚዲያ ለለውጥ እንደትልቅ አማራጭ ሊያገለግል ይችላል፤ ለውጡ አብዛኛውን ጊዜ ፖለቲካዊ ወይም ማኀበራዊ ሲሆን ታዋቂው ጦማሪ የዶሱ ሂዘር አርምስትሮንግ እንዳረጋገጠው ደግሞ ትልልቅ ኩባንያዎች ቅሬታዎን እንዲሰሙ የማደረግም አቅም አለው፡፡	It has become clear in recent years; if there is enough noise and a lot of listeners (not a good joke) social media can be used as a great alternative to change; change is usually political or social, and according to famous blogger Dr. Harrison, it can also make large companies hear your complaints.
85	And while that often means political or social change, it can also mean — as famous blogger Heather Armstrong, aka Dooce, has proven — the ability to get a major company to listen to your complaints.	ባለፈው ረቡዕ በግብጽ አየር መንገድ አገልግሎት ተስፋ የቆረጠችው እንግሊዝ-ግብጻዊቷ ጸሐፊ ኤሚ ሞዋፊ ትኬት ለመቁረጥ በአየር መንገዱ ያገጠማትን ፈተና ለሌሎች ለማካፈል ወደ ትዊተር ወሰደችው፡፡	Yesterday, Emily Mowbray, an English-born Ethiopian writer, took her experience with the Ethiopian Airlines airline to share with others.
86	Adding a hashtag, Mowafi encouraged followers to tweet their own complaints about the airline: To all those who've been tortured by @flyegyptair please join me in my plight to get them to answer and explain themselves #DearEgyptAir	ከዚህ በፊት በ@flyegyptair ለተጎሳቀላችሁ በሙሉ ራሳቸው መልስ እንዲሰጡን እና እንዲያስረዱ ቅሬታዬን በመደገፍ እርዱኝ ፡፡	Help me support my complaint by supporting me in support of all of you who were taken off by @flyegyptair before.

116	According to the note below by his wife and fellow journalist Serkalem Fasil, when he was a rrested, Eskinder was bringing their 6 year old child from school. The police stopped him on his way and would not even let him bring the kid home.	ከዚህ በታች በእስክንድር ነጋ ባለቤት እና የሙያ አጋር ሰርካለም ፋሲል በሰፈረው ማስታወሻ መሰረት፣ ሲያዝ የ6 ዓመቱን ልጁን ከትምህርት ቤት እያመጣ ነበር፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

118	What was strange was that they ( police) kept video tapping and taking pictures as the boy was crawling on the ground and crying watching his father who was being thrown around and hand cuffed.	የሚያስገርመው ነገር ታዲያ፣ ይሄ ሲሆን እና ልጅ የአባቱን በካቴና መጠርነፍ እና መንገላታት በማየት እየጮኸ መሬት ላይ የሚንከባለለውን ልጅ አሳሪዎቹ በቪዲዮ ለመቅረፅ መሞከራቸው ነው፡፡	The strange thing is that, when this happens, and the child screams and screams while his father is being stuck in the cage, the killers try to take a video of the child who is lying on the ground.

217	A result of this process is not necessarily a better or more free Internet, but, nevertheless, the current course of action is not going to help the Iranian establishment either.	የሂደቱም ውጤት የግድ በየነ መረብ የተሻለ” ፣ የበለጠ ነጻ” እንዲሆን ላይሆን ይችላል፡፡ ግና ግና አሁን እየተካሄደ ያለው ተግባር ኢራናውያን በሁለት እግራቸው እንዲቆሙ የሚረዳቸው አይደለም፡፡	"If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The result of the process may not necessarily be ""better"" or ""more free"" than the Persian network. However, the current activity does not help Iranians stand up on their two feet."
218	They are pushing people towards a more vigilant approach to the Internet.	እነርሱ ህዝቡን እየገፉት ያሉት የበለጠ ጥንቃቄ ወደሚያሻው የበየነ መረብ አገልግሎት ነው፡፡	They are leading the people to a more serious Internet service.
219	They are telling people go learn how to use a VPN, and I foresee that being exactly what is going to happen.	ለህዝቡ እየነገሩት ያሉት ይሄንን ነው ሂዱ ቪፒኤን እንዴት መጠቀም እንዳለባችኹ ተማሩ” እናም በእርግጠኝነት ምን እንደሚፈጠር መተንበይ እችላለው፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. They're telling the people this, go learn how to use VPN. I can guess what will happen.
220	A Facebook campaign has launched to call for Internet freedom and the right to access Google.	የበየነ መረብ ነጻነትን እና ጎግል የመጠቀም መብትን ለመጠየቅ የፌስቡክ ዘመቻ ይፋ ተደርጓል፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
221	Mana Neyestani's cartoon (right) on Google being filtered is eye-catching on this Facebook page.	ጎግል ሲጠል የሚያሳየው የማና ነይስታኒ ካርቱንም (በቀኝ በኩል) በዚህ የፌስቡክ ገጽ አይነ ገብ ነው፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
222	Several Iranian netizens also tweeted about the filtering with irony.	በርካታ ኢራናውያን የበየነ መረብ ተጠቃሚዎች በውስጠ ዘ ስለማጥለሉ ተውተዋል፡፡	Many Iranians have given up on their ability to hide their secrets.
223	Behran Tajdin tweeted :	ባህራን ታጅዲን ይህን ትዊት አደረገ ፤	The Bahraini telegraph published this tweet. If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.

228	In reality the primary victim in this decision is not Google, but the freedom of Iranians.	በእውነቱ የዚህ ውሳኔ ቀዳሚ ተጠቂ ጎግል ሳይሆን የኢራናውያን ነጻነት ነው፡፡	If you can't translate this decision simply say you don't know.
229	It seems even virtual freedoms are too much for the Islamic regime.	ለእስላማዊ ስርዓት የበየነ መረብ ነጻነት እጅግ የሚበዛ ይመስላል፡፡	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.

233	Many people have come out to congratulate her, whilst some are saying she will not survive her term in parliament because of her age and limited experience.	ብዙ ሰዎች ደስታቸውን ሊገልፁላት ወጥተዋል፤ ሌሎች ደግሞ በውሱን ልምዷና ዕድሜዋ ምክንያት በፓርላማ ጊዜዋ እንደማይሳካላት ስጋታቸውን ገልፀዋል፡፡	Many people went out to congratulate her. Some told her that she would not succeed in the parliament due to her limited experience and her age.
234	Some people believe this is the beginning of change in Africa and its time to get rid of the overly old leaders and allow young people to take the continent forward.	አንዳንዶች ይህ በአፍሪካ የሚመጣው ለውጥ መጀመሪያ እንደሆነ እየተናገሩ ነው፤ እናም ይህ ከመጠንበላይ የጃጁ የአፍሪካ መሪዎችን አስወግዶ በወጣቶች ለመተኪያ እና ወደፊት ለመራመጂ ጊዜው ነው ይላሉ፡፡	Some say this is the first change in Africa, and it is the time to replace the overly conservative African leaders with young people and move on.

270	Monday's official confirmation of Ethiopia’s Prime Minster Meles Zenawi's death, sparked reactions among social media users in Tanzania, especially after tweets started appearing from what some thought was Zenawi's official Twitter account.	የኢትዮጵያ ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር መለስ ዜናዊ ሞት፣ የሰኞ ዕለት የመንግስት ኃላፊዎች ማረጋገጫ በታንዛኒያ የሚገኙ የማሕበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚዎችን አነቃንቋል፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
271	In all started when Zitto Zuberi Kabwe, a Member of Parliament from Tanzania, sent this tweet:	በተለይ የአቶ መለስ ትዊተር አካውንት ነው ከሚባለው መልስ ማግኘት ከተጀመረ በኋላ ነገርዬው ተጋግሎ ነበር፡፡	Especially after the answer to the question of what is the Twitter account of Mr. Mohammed was started to be received. If you cannot translate it simply say you don't know.
272	@zittokabwe: My condolences to the people of #Ethiopia following the death of Prime Minister #MelesZenawi Hope for a democratic developmental Abbysinia	ነገሩ ወዲህ ነው፣ የታንዛኒያ ፓርላማ አባል ዢቶ ዙቤሪ ካብዌ የሚከተለውን በትዊተር ላይ ጻፉ፡	"Then, a senator from Tanzania wrote on Twitter: ""If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know."""
273	Chambi Chachage tweeted a blog post titled ‘Meles Zenawi's Farewell to Young African Leaders' from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) on 16 November 2006, which was retweeted by others. And then suddenly @PMMelesZenawi intervened, apparently 'tweeting after death' to Tanzania's Member of Parliament Zitto Kabwe:	@zittokabwe: በጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር #መለስ ዜናዊ ሞት ለ#ኢትዮጵያ ሕዝብ የተሰማኝ ሐዘን ጥልቅ ነው፡፡	@zittokabwe: My deep grief for the Ethiopian people is very deep.
274	@PMMelesZenawi: @zittokabwe please be better than I was.	ሱዛን ማሺቤ ‏መልስ ሰጠች:	"Susan Mishbee replied: ""I don't know."

277	Source: Twitter Screen Shot	ምንጭ: ከትዊተር ላይ የተወሰደ	Source: taken from Twitter
278	This tweet to Zitto Kabwe, who has more than 29,000 followers, caused a stir, setting off speculation- was ‏@PMMelesZenawi hacked by opponents?	ይህ 29,000 ላለው ለዢቶ ካብዌ የተጻፈ ትዊት መወያያ ርዕስ ከፍቷል፡፡ ግምቱ ‏@PMMelesZenawi በተቀናቃኛቸው ተጠልፎ ይሆን የሚል ነበር፡፡	This 29,000-like tweet opened a discussion for a debate on a controversial topic. The estimate was that PM Meles Zenawi might have been taken prisoner by a rival.
279	@zittokabwe: @hmgeleka this account seems not to be genuine of recent @pmmeleszenawi	@zittokabwe: @hmgeleka ይህ አካውንት እውነተኛ ወይም የቅርብ ጊዜ አይመስለኝም @pmmeleszenawi	@zittokabwe: @hmgeleka This account doesn't seem to be real or recent. @pmmeleszenawi
280	Zitto Zuberi Kabwe concluded, and continued:	ዢቶ ዙብሪ ካብዌ ይህንን ገምተው ቀጠሉ፡	However, according to Scout Zubiri Cabwe, this is not true.
281	@zittokabwe: @AnnieTANZANIA tweets by @PMMelesZenawi not genuine.	@zittokabwe: @AnnieTANZANIA በ@PMMelesZenawi ትዊት የተደረገልኝ እውነተኛ አይደለም፡፡	@zittokabwe: @AnnieTANZANIA @AnnieTANZANIA doesn't know what I was tweeted by PMMelesZenawi.
282	Account hacked by his opponents	ተዉት በቃ፣ አካውንቱ በተቀናቃኛቸው ተጠልፏል፡፡	Leave it, the account has been stolen by their rival.
283	Omar Ilyas backed it:	ኦማር ኢሊያስ መልስ ሰጠ:	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
284	However, the debate on Meles Zenawi’s legacy continued ranging from both admiration for Meles ability to ‘get the job done’ to the widespread awareness that Meles was not a democrat:	@Htunga: @zittokabwe መለስ ግን የምር ማን ነው? ኢትዮጵያውያኖች እየተራቡ እና በጭነት መኪናዎች ላይ ታፍነው እየሞቱ አያለሁ፡፡	@Htunga: @zittokabwe Why is anyone really a fool? I see Ethiopians hungry and being killed by heavy vehicles.
285	@Htunga: @zittokabwe Who is Meles seriously?I see Ethiopians starving n dying in lorries..I remember the shooting in 2010 too.	@zittokabwe: @Htunga በኔሬሬ ጊዜ ታንዛኒያዎችስ እየተራቡና እየሞቱ አልነበረም?	@zittokabwe: @Htunga In Namibia, didn't Tanzanians die of hunger and hunger during the apartheid era?
286	@zittokabwe: @Htunga were Tanzanians not starving and dying during Nyerere?	ነገር ግን በመርሆቹ መሰረት እናከብረዋለን፡፡	But we will preserve it according to its rules.
287	But we celebrate him because of his principles.	መለስም ያው ነው፡፡	Again, it's the same.
288	Meles the same’ @zittokabwe: @PMMelesZenawi regardless of his mistakes, #MelesZenawi remains a role model to me.	@zittokabwe: @PMMelesZenawi ከስህተተታቸው ባሻገር #መለስ ዜናዊ የኔ አርአያ ሆነው ይቀጥላሉ፡፡	@zittokabwe: @PMMelesZenawi Beyond their mistakes, #መለስ ዜናዊ will remain my example.
289	You have freedom to bring back #TheDerg or Isaias	ነፃነትን መልሶ የማግኘት መብት አለህ #ደርግ ወይም ኢሳይያስ	You have the right to regain freedom.
290	The fake (supposedly hacked) @PMMelesZenawi Twitter account, which managed to set off the debate mentioned above, also raises the question of why many public figures and politicians in Africa haven’t had their Twitter accounts verified.	የውሸቱ (ምናልባትም የተጠለፈው) የ@PMMelesZenawi የትዊተር አካውንት፣ ከላይ ያየነውን ክርክር ከማስነሳቱም በላይ ብዙ የአፍሪካ መሪዎች እና ታዋቂ ሰዎች የትዊተር አካውንታቸውን እውነተኝነት አለማረጋገጣቸውን እንደጥያቄ አስነስቷል፡፡	The false (or maybe stolen) Twitter account of @PMMelesZenawi raised the question above, as well as many African leaders and famous people who did not confirm their Twitter account was true.
291	Reportedly, in many cases Twitter takes too long, or simply never respond to requests for verifying accounts.	ከዚህ በፊት እንደተነገረው፣ ትዊተር እንዲህ ዓይነት አካውንቶችን ማረጋገጫ እንዲያስቀምጥ ሲጠየቅ ወይ ለረዥም ጊዜ መልስ ሳይሰጥ ይቆያል አሊያም ደግሞ ከናካቴው መልስ ሳይሰጥ ይቀራል፡፡	As mentioned above, Twitter does not respond to such requests for verification for a long time or simply does not respond.
292	Twitter is extremely popular in Tanzania as a tool for exchanging views and debate and also as a platform for breaking news.	በታንዛንያ ከፍተኛ ዝነኝነት ያገኘው ትዊተር አመለካከቶችን እና ክርክሮችን ያስተናግዳል፣ ለሰበር ዜናዎችም እንደማስተላለፊያ ምንጭ እየሆነ ነው፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.

310	I recently read the M.A. thesis of Arwen Hoogenbosch	በቅርቡ ያነበብኩት አንድ የአርወን ሁግንቦሽ ኤም.	I recently read an Aryan horoscope.

313	He got to know his fellow students, and reports on their varied goals and hopes for learning Chinese.	አርወን አብረውት ለተለያየ ዓላማ እና ተስፋ ውስጥ ቻይኒኛ ያጠኑ ተማሪዎችን ሪፖርት አይቷል፡፡	Aaron saw students studying Chinese with him for different goals and hopes.
314	She continues:	ተመራማሪዋ ቀጥለውም ይናገራሉ:	"The researcher continued to say: ""If you can't translate, just say you don't know."""
315	Arwen's analysis of the motives for Zambians to study Chinese is thoughtful.	የአርወን ትንታኔ እንደሚያስረዳው፣ ዛምቢያዎች ቻይኒኛ የሚያጠኑት አርቀው በማሰብ ነው፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
316	Some thought it would advance their job prospects, although Arwen writes: it appears that Chinese companies prefer Chinese skilled employees.	አንዳንዶች የሥራ አድማሳቸውን እንደሚያሰፋላቸው ያስባሉ፤ ነገር ግን አርወን በጽሑፉ እንዲህ ይላል፡	Some people think that it will expand their work area, but Arnie says that it doesn't.
317	I think there is a lot more potential for Africans who speak Chinese than perhaps Arwen does.	የቻይና ኩባንያዎች በቻይና የሰለጠኑ ተቀጣሪዎችን ይፈልጋሉ፡፡   አርወን ከሚችለው ቻይኒኛ የተሸለ የሚናገሩ ብዙ አፍሪካውያን ሳይኖሩ አይቀሩም፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

323	On the plus side: cheap Chinese cell phone have allowed Africans at the bottom of the pyramid to communicate in unexpectedly large numbers.	በበጎ ጎኑ ስንመለከተው ደግሞ፤ በፓይራሚዱ መቀመጫ ላይ ያሉ አፍሪካውያንን ርካሾቹ የቻይና ተንቀሳቃሽ ስልኮች ባልተጠበቀ ቁጥር ተጠቃሚ አድርገዋቸዋል፡፡	In the positive, the cheap Chinese mobile phones have made Africans in the pacific seats of the pyramid a huge advantage.

328	Last week, the new Land Matrix land grab database was released at a big World Bank conference on land.	ባለፈው ሳምንት፣ አዲሱ የመሬት ማትሪክስ የመሬት መቀራመት የመረጃ ቋት በትልቁ የዓለም ባንክ የመሬት አውደጉባኤ ላይ ታይቶ ነበር፡፡	Last week, a new satellite mapping data set was shown at the World Bank's Earth Conference.
329	The Land Matrix project is an international partnership involving five major European research centres and 40 civil society and research groups from around the world.	የመሬት ማትሪክሱ ፕሮጀክት የአውሮፓ ምርምር ማዕከልን እና በዓለም ዙሪያ የሚገኙ 40 የሲቪል ማሕበራትና ተመራማሪዎች ቡድንን ዓለም አቀፍ ትብብር ነው፡፡	The Earth Mapping Project is a global partnership between the European Research Centre and 40 civil society and research groups across the world.
330	On paper, they have a strong methodology and very strict criteria about projects that are to be included.	በጥናቱ፣ ጠንካራ አዘገጃጀት እና መካተት ስላለባቸው ፕሮጀክቶች በጣም ቀጥተኛ መመዘኛ አላቸው፡፡	In the study, there are very strict criteria for projects that require strong planning and inclusion. If you cannot translate, just say you don't know.
331	But in practice, they seem to violate their own rules routinely, at least when it comes to Chinese projects in Africa.	በተግባር ግን፣ የገዛ መመዘኛቸውን በተደጋጋሚ ሲጥሱት ታይተዋል፤ ቢያንስ በአፍሪካ ያሉ የቻይና ፕሮጀክቶችን በተመለከተ፡፡	In practice, they have been repeatedly breaking their own standards, at least with regard to Chinese projects in Africa.
332	She goes on to list Chinese zombie land grabs in Africa:	የቻይኖቹ ዞምቢዎች መሬት ወረራ በአፍሪካን ተመራማሪዋ በጥልቀት ሲዘረዝሩት:	If you can't translate the invasion of the Chinese Empire, just say you don't know.
333	I understand there is a lot of Chinese land investment in Asia, especially in Cambodia and Laos.	በእስያ፣ በተለይም በካምቦዲያ እና በሌኦስ ብዙ የቻይኖች መሬት ኢንቨስትመንት እንዳለ ይገባኛል፡፡	I know that many Chinese land investments are in Asia, particularly in Cambodia and Laos. If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
334	I don't know the Asia cases, but when the database was made public, I checked the China-Africa cases in the online database, which supposedly only lists the cases that have passed their robust fact-checking process (which apparently involves checking to see if another NGO has published a link to a media report on an alleged case).	የእስያውን ጉዳይ አላውቅም፤ የመረጃ ቋቱ ይፋ ሲወጣ ግን፣ የቻይና-አፍሪካን ጉዳይ ተመልከቼዋለሁ፡፡ እንደምትገምቱት ሁለገብ ዝርዝሮችን ብቻ ለጥሬ ሐቅ ማመሳከሪያነት ያስቀምጣል (ይህም ምናልባት ሌላ መንግስታዊ ያልሆነ ድርጅት አጠራጣሪ መረጃ አውጥቶ ከሆነ ለማመሳከር ብቻ ይበጃል)፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know I don't know the issue of Asia, but when the information warehouse was published, I saw the issue of China-Africa. As you probably guess, it places only two-dimensional details for a genuine proof (which might be enough to prove a false report by another non-governmental organization).
335	I was interested to see which Zombie Chinese projects (i.e. dead projects, or projects that in fact never had any life to them at all!) are in their database as confirmed.	እኔ በጣም ፈልጌ የነበረው ዞምቢዎቹን የቻይና ፕሮጀክቶች ጉዳይ በመረጃ ቋታቸው ውስጥ እርግጡን ለማየት ነበር፡፡ (ያለቁ ፕሮጀክቶች፣ ወይም ለእነርሱ መኖራቸው እንኳን የማይታወቁትን ፕሮጀክቶችን ጉዳይ ማለቴ ነው) ይህን ምሳሌ ተመልከቱ:	I wanted to see the facts of the remaining Chinese projects in their databases. (I mean the remaining projects, or the projects that are not known to them even if they exist) See this example:
336	Here is a sample:	8 ሚሊዮን ሄክታር የፓልም ዘይት ፕሮጀክት አለው፡፡	If you can't translate it simply say you don't know.

338	Huh?	ቀልድ?	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know jokes?
339	This proposed joint venture is not Chinese but South African-Chinese-Ethiopian, and was listed in an Ethiopian database in 2008 as in the pre-implementation phase.	ይህ የጥምረት ፕሮጀክት የቻይኖች አይደለም፣ ነገር ግን የደቡብ አፍሪካዊ - ቻይናዊ - ኢትዮጵያዊ ፕሮጀክት ነው፡፡	This joint project is not Chinese, but a South African-Chinese-Ethiopian project.
340	It has never been implemented.	እስካሁን አልተጀመረም፡፡	It hasn't started yet.

349	Keita's piece makes a lot of good points.	የኬታ ጽሑፍ ብዙ ጥሩ ነጥቦችን ያነሳል፡፡	The Kate article makes a lot of good points. If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
350	Investigative reporters have a very tough road in many parts of Africa and there are many examples of courage under impossibly tough conditions.	ምርምር አዘል ሪፖርት በአፍሪካ እጅግ ፈታኝ የሆነ መንገድ ከፊቱ ይደቀንበታል፤ እናም በማይቻለው ጎዳና ላይ ብዙ ደፋር እርምጃዎችን መውሰዱን መጥቀስ ይቻላል፡፡	Research reports indicate that Africa has a very difficult road ahead of it, and it can be noted that he has taken many bold steps on the unthinkable road.
351	However, his opinion oversteps his evidence in linking increased Chinese economic activity in Africa with increased repression of the media.	በአስተያየቱ፣ ቻይና በአፍሪካ የምታደርገው ምጣኔ ሃብታዊ እንቅስቃሴን እና የመገናኛ ብዙሐን መታፈንን ግንኙነት ለመዘርዘር ማስረጃዎችን አቅርቧል፡፡	In his speech, China presented evidence to explain its economic activities in Africa and the media censorship.
352	Asking Why this disturbing trend? (of media repression) Keita points to (inter alia) the influence of China, which surpassed the West as Africa’s largest trading partner in 2009.	ለምን ይህ አስጨናቂ መገናኛ ብዙሐንን የማፈን እርምጃ አስፈለገ?  ሲል ይጠይቃል፡፡ ኬታ የሚመልሰው ምዕራባውያንን በ2009 የበለጠው የቻይና-አፍሪካ የንግድ ሸሪክነትን እንደሰበብ በማስቀመጥ ነው፡፡	Why did this disturbing media ban be necessary? asked Kate.
353	As an example of this causal linkage, Keita wrote: The volume of trade between Rwanda and China increased fivefold between 2005 and 2009. During the same period, the government has eviscerated virtually all critical press and opposition and has begun filtering Rwandan dissident news Web sites based abroad.	ለነዚህ ጉዳዮች ግንኙነት ምሳሌ ኬታ የሚያቀርበው፣ በ2005 እና በ2009 መካከል የቻይና እና ሩዋንዳ የንግድ ግንኙነት በ5 እጥፍ አድጓል፡፡	Examples of such ties include, according to Kaya, the bilateral trade between China and Russia has grown by five times between 2005 and 2009, according to Kaya.
354	She agrees with Keita about Chinese technical and media ties with African government:	ተመራማሪዋ፣ የአፍሪካ መንግስት መገናኛ ብዙሐን አፈና እና የቻይኖች ቴክኒካዊ ድጋፍ ትስስርን በተመለከተ ከኬታ ጋር ይስማማሉ:	The researcher agrees with Katya about the interference of the government's media and the technological cooperation of Chinese.
355	Keita actually does make a good point in his observation that with growing trade, China has been deepening technical and media ties with African governments to counter the kind of critical press coverage that both parties demonize as neocolonialist.	ኬታ ጥሩ ነጥብ ያነሳው እያደገ ባለ የንግድ ግንኙነት ቻይና ሐያሲ ፕሬሶችን ለማፈን እና ቴክኒካል ድጋፍ በመስጠት ሁለቱም ኒዮ ኮሎኒያሊስት እያሉ በሚጠሩት ሰበብ ተሳስረዋል፡፡	Kitty pointed out that the growing trade ties between China and the US created a political alliance between the two countries because they both called each other neo-colonialists.
356	Rather than training African reporters to be like Xinhua reporters, the Chinese goal in stepping up training and PR activities is to present a different picture of Chinese activities in Africa to counter the negative reporting eminating from the West.	የአፍሪካ ሪፖረተሮች እንደ ዢኖዋ ሪፖርተሮች እንዲሆኑ በማሰልጠን ፈንታ፣ የቻይናውያን ዓላማ በምዕራባውያን ስለቻይና በአፍሪካ ኢንቨስትመንት የሚወራውን አሉታዊ ዜና የሚያስተባብል ስልጠና እና ማሕበራዊ ግንኙነት ላይ ማተኮር ይዘዋል፡፡	If you can't translate, just say you don't know. Instead of training African reporters like Xinhua reporters, China's aim is to promote a teaching and social cooperation that suppresses negative reports about China's investments in Africa by Westerners.

381	Censorship motives	የሳንሱር መግፍኤዎች	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
382	In Lebanon, censorship practices are either politically, religiously or morally motivated.	በሊባኖስ የሳንሱር ልምዶች ፖለቲካዊ ፣ ሀይማኖታዊ ወይም የሞራላዊ መግፍኤዎች ውጤት ናቸው፡፡	If you cannot translate the separation practices in Lebanon simply say you don't know.
383	The Virtual Museum of Censorship explains:	ፖለቲካዊ ምክንያቶች፡	Political reasons:
384	Political reasons: regarding foreign relations with friendly countries, the censor pays considerable attention to the political sensitivities of Arab regimes and endeavors to safeguard diplomatic relations with these countries as well as banning attacks on the Palestinian cause and Arabs in general.	ከወዳጅ ሀገራት ጋር የሚደረግ የውጭ ግንኙነትን በተመለከተ የሳንሱር ሂደቱ ለአረብ ሀገራት የአገዛዝ ስርዓቶች ፖለቲካዊ ትኩሳቶች ላቅ ያለ ትኩረትን ይሰጣል፤ ከእነዚህ ሀገራት ጋር ያለን ዲፕሎማሲያዊ ግንኙነቶች ለመጠበቅ ጥረት ያደርጋል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
385	Films on the civil war have been routinely censored since the nineties on the basis that referring to the conflict threatens civil peace”.	ከዘጠናዎቹ ጀምሮ የሲቪል ሰላም በማስፈራራት” እንደመሰረት በመጥቀስ በእርስ በርስ ጦርነትን የሚያሳዩ ፊልሞችበተደጋጋሚ ታግደዋል፡፡	"If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know From the 1990s, violence-inducing films have been banned often because they are based on the principle of ""threatening civil rights."""
386	Israel: regarding relations with enemy states, censorship is firstly based on a national law that calls for the boycott of all Israeli products.	ከጠላት ሀገር ጋር ያለ ግንኙነትን በተመለከተ መጀመሪያ ሳንሱር መሰረት ያደረገው የእስራኤል ምርቶችን በሙሉ አለመጠቀምን የሚጠራውን ብሔራዊ ህግ ነው፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
387	Secondly, there is censorship of all forms of publicity or compassion for Israel : this boycott was initially observed by the entire Arab League.	በመቀጠል ለእስራኤል ሁሉም አይነት ቅርጽ ያላቸው ማስተዋወቆች ወይም ርህራሄ ያላቸው ነገሮች ለእግድ ተዳርገዋል፡፡ ይህ እስራኤል ላይ የተጣለ እግድ በመነሻ በመላው የአረብ ሊግ ሀገራት ነበር፡፡	Next, all advertising or hospitality objects for Israel were prohibited. This ban was first imposed on all the Arab League countries.
388	Today, only Lebanon and Syria adhere to it stringently(...)	ዛሬ ሊባኖስ እና ሶርያ ብቻ በትጋት እንዲፈጸም ይጥራሉ ፡፡	Today only Lebanon and Syria are trying to accomplish it. If you can't translate it simply say you don't know.
389	Religion: General Security will send creative works it thinks might upset religious sensitivities to their respective governing bodies (usually the Catholic Information Center or the Dar-al-Fatwa, which is Lebanon’s highest Sunni Muslim authority).	ጠቅላይ ደህንነት የፈጠራ ውጤቶች ሀይማኖታዊ ቁጣዎችን የሚቀሰቅሱ ናቸው ብሎ ካሰበ ወደሚመለከታቸው አካላት (አብዛኛውን ጊዜ ለካቶሊክ የመረጃ ማዕከል ወይም በሊባኖስ ትልቁ የሱኒ ሙስሊም ባለስልጣን ለሆነው ለዳር አል ፈጣዋ ) ይልካቸዋል፡፡	If the NSA thinks that creations are religiously motivated, it sends them to authorities (usually to the Catholic Information Center or the largest Muslim official in Lebanon, Dar al-Fata'a)
390	Scenes or topics that question the ability of religion to counter evil and offensive scenes are removed.	ገቢሮች ወይም ርዕሶች የሀይማኖትን አቅም ምላሽ የመጠየቅ ለመጻረር አቅም ካለውና የሚያስቀይም ከሆነ ገቢሮቹ ይወገዳሉ፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. If arguments or topics cannot be translated simply say you don't know.
391	Obscene and Immoral content: regarding censorship material which offends public morals, contains scenes of nudity, sex and foul language are strictly censored and the censor generally determines the extent to which the film or work does not offend public morals.	የህብረተሰቡን ሞራል የሚነካ ውጤትን በተመለከተ ሳንሱር የሚደረገው ራቁት ገቢር ፣ ወሲብና ጋጣወጥ ቋንቋን ያካተተ ከሆነ የግድ ሳንሱር ይደረጋሉ የሳንሱር ምርመራው የሚጠበቅበት ፊልምም ሆነ ሌላ ስራ የህብረተሰቡን ሞራል የማይነካ መሆኑን ማረጋገጥ ነው፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know If the screening is compulsory for a film or other work that contains explicit sexual acts or erotic language , it must be screened. The screening is compulsory for a film or other work that does not offend the public.
392	Also, works that promote homosexuality are prohibited but violent scenes or scenes depicting drug use are allowed.	የአመጽ ገቢር ወይም የአደንዛዥ ዕፅ ተጠቃሚነት የሚወክሉ ገቢሮች ግን የተፈቀዱ ናቸው፡፡	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
393	Twitter reactions	የቲዊተር ምላሾች	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
394	On Twitter, the initiative was welcomed:	በትዊተር ይህ ስራ መልካም ተቀባይነትን አግኝቷል፡፡	This work has received a good response on Twitter.

397	Can democracy exist in Islamic societies?	‘በኢስላማዊ ማኀበረሰብ ዴሞክራሲ ሊኖር ይችላል?	Is there democracy in the Muslim community?
398	This was the topic of conversation between Bahraini bloggers today.	’ዛሬ ይህ ርዕስ በባህሬናውያን ጦማሪዎች መካከል መነጋገሪያ ሆኗል፡፡	Today, this topic has become a topic of conversation among Bahraini writers. If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
399	Bahraini artist Al Shaikh raised the issue when he tweeted :	ጉዳየን ያነሳው የባህሬናውው አርቲስት አል ሻክህ ትዊት በማድረግ ነው :	The issue was raised by the Broadway actor Al Shaked.
400	@Anas_Al_Shaikh: It is difficult to separate between what is political and what is religious in Islamic societies and this is why democracy will never succeed even if we write the best constitutions and accept the peaceful rotation of power	@Anas_Al_Shaikh፤ በኢስላማዊ ማኀበረሰብ ውስጥ ፓለቲካ ምን አንደሆነ እና ሀይማኖት ምን እንደሆነ ለመለየት አስቸጋሪ ነው፤ ለዚህም ይመስላል ምንም እንኳን ምርጥ ህገ መንግስት ብናዘጋጅም ሰላማዊ የስልጣን ሽክርክርን ብንቀበል ዴሞክራሲ ተሳክቶልን የማያውቀው፡፡	@Anas_Al_Shaikh; It is difficult to distinguish politics from religion in an Islamic community; that's why democracy hasn't worked for us, even if we have a good constitution, a peaceful political debate.
401	Fearless Ba7rainia replies:	ፊርለስ ባሪኒያ መለሰ፤	Fernando Barca replied.
402	@fearlessbahrain: Democracy is the solution and the remedy for such problems. If laws are developed, people will improve too in a natural way.	@fearlessbahrain፤ ለእንደዚህ አይነት ችግሮች ዴሞክራሲ መፍትሔና ፈዋሽ ነው፤ ህጎች ከተዘጋጁ በተፈጥሮዓዊ መንገድ እየተሻሻሉ ይመጣሉ፡፡	@fearlessbahrain; Democracy is the solution and cure for such problems; laws are changed naturally when they are created.
403	A civil society is our people's savior	የሲቪል ማኀበረሰብ የኛ ህዝብ መድህን ነው፡፡	The civil society is our people's salvation.
404	Bahraini journalist Abbas Busafwan has another take. He responds to Al Shaikh's original tweet saying:	ባህሬናዊው ጋዜጠኛ አባስ ቡሳፍዋን ሌላ መወሰድ አለው፤ ለአል ሻይክህ የመጀመሪያ ትዊት እንዲህ ሲል መለሰ፤	"The Bahraini journalist asked for another t-shirt, and he replied, ""I don't know."""
405	@abbasbusafwan: This conclusion is really painful. It could be a generalisation.	@abbasbusafwan፤ ይህ ድምዳሜ በእውነት ያማል፤ ይህ በጅምላ መፈረጅ (generalization) ነው ፡፡	@abbasbusafwan; This conclusion is true; this is a generalization.
406	Perhaps Turkey's example is a success	ምን አልባት ቱርክ የስኬት ተምሳሌት ልትሆን ትችላለች፡፡	Maybe Turkey could be a success symbol. If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
407	Al Shaikh answers:	አል ሻይከህ መለሰለት፤	If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
408	@Anas_Al_Shaikh: Turkey did not balance between religious and political issues.	@Anas_Al_Shaikh፤ በቱርክ የሀይማኖት እና ፖለቲካዊ ጉዳዮችን ሚዛናዊ አይደሉም፡፡	@Anas_Al_Shaikh; in Turkey, religious and political issues are not equal.
409	For instance, Turkey has rights for gays, and I saw them myself protesting on the famous Taksim street	ለምሳሌ በቱርክ የግብረ ሰዶማውያንን መብት አለ፤ እናም እኔ ራሴ በታዋቂው ታክሲም ጎዳና ተቃውሞ አይቻለው፡፡	For example, in Turkey there is a right for gays, so I can't protest in the famous tramway.
410	And Ahmed Al-haddad adds:	አህመድ አል ሓዳድም ጨመረበት	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
411	@DiabloHaddad: Turkey isn't today what it was during the rule of Ataturk. The famous Erdogan took Turkey to the pre-Ataturk era	@DiabloHaddad፤ ዛሬ ቱርክ በመራሔ አታቱርክ እንደነበረችው አይደለችም፤ ታዋቂው ኤርዶጋን ቱርክን ወደ ቅድመ አታቱክ ዘመን መልሷታል፡፡	@DiabloHaddad; Today Turkey is not the former Turkey; famous ErdoÄŸan has returned Turkey to the pre-Attoman era.
412	In reply, Busafwan jokes:	ቡሳፍዋን በመልሱ ቀለደ፤	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
413	@abbasbusafwan: I think that Saudi Arabia is the best example of democracy, Shura, Human rights, free Press, and balancing between religion and politics	@abbasbusafwan፤ ሳውዲ አረቢያ የዴሞክራሲ ምርጥ ምሳሌ ትመስለኛለች፤ ሹራ፣ ሰብዓዊ መብት፣ ነጻ ፕሬስ፣ በሀይማኖት እና ፓለቲካ መካከል ሚዛናውነት	@abbasbusafwan; Saudi Arabia seems to be the best example of democracy; separation of church and state, free press, equality between religion and politics.
414	Abu Yousif agrees that politics and religion don't mix:	አቡ ዮሲፍ በሃይማኖት እና ፖለቲካ አለመቀላቀል ይስማማል፤	Abu Yusuf agrees to avoid political and religious interference.
415	@xronos2: I agree. We shouldn't mix religion with politics for they don't agree and then we would become a repressive regime like Iran	@xronos2፤ እስማማለው ሃይማኖት እና ፖለቲካን መቀላቀል የለብንም እነርሱ ግን አይስማሙም ከዚያም ልክ እንደኢራን ጨቋኝ ስርዓት ይኖረናል፡፡	@xronos2; I agree that we should not join faith and politics but they don't, so we will have a fascist regime like Iran.
416	And Abu Karim says we should improve what we already have instead of importing a Western-style democracy:	አቡ ካሪም የምዕራባውያን የዴሞክራሲ ዘዬ ከውጭ ከምናመጣ ያለንን ማሻሻል ይገባናል ይላል፤	Abu Kariya says that we should improve our democracy style from abroad, if we cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
417	@AbuKarim1: Our problem is that we want to implement Western theories on our societies instead of searching in what we have and modernising it	@AbuKarim1፤ ችግራችን ያለንን ከማሠስ እና እርሱን ከማዘመን ይልቅ በእኛ ማኀበረሰብ ላይ የምዕራባውያንን ንድፈ ዐሳብ ለመተግበር እንፈልጋለን፡፡	@AbuKarim1; We want to apply the European philosophy to our society rather than to fix our problems and modify them.

The text below shows the situation in a short paragraph.
444	Before he threw the shoe, he said, even if your talk is not good, you can go back to your hotel.	‹‹ከሁሉ አስቀድሜ አቶ ሲማ ናንን እንኳን ወደ ሀይናን ዩንቨርስቲ በሰላም መቱ ለማለት እፈልጋለሁ፡፡	First of all, I want to say that Mr. Simin went to the University of China peacefully.

445	If I argue against it, certainly I will be locked up in a tiny dark room.	እኔም እዚህ ተማሪ ነኝና፡፡	I'm also a student here.
446	The student took the action during a Question and Answer session.	በመጀመሪያ በአንድ ወቅት ስለ ሶቅራጠስ አንብቤለሁ በአንድ እናም እኔ ማውቀው አለማወቄን ነው ይላል፡፡	First I read about aspartacus in a book and I don't know.

449	I want to make a few points.	እኛ በእኩልነት ነፃነታችንን ማራመድ አልቻልንም፡፡	We can't exercise our freedom in equality.
450	Secondly, I need freedom and democracy is a means to protect freedom. Thirdly, I have to say, your talk against democracy has invaded my freedom. We are not equally able to exercise our freedom of speech.	ምንም እንኳን የምትናገረው ጥሩ ነገር ባይሆንም፣ ወደ ሆቴልህ መመለስ ትችላለህ፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know You can return to your hotel even if you don't know what you're saying.

455	You should have the manners not to interrupt me.	ሌላ ተማሪ በወቅቱ ነበረውን ሁኔታ በጦማሩ ሲገልፅ:	Other student explained the situation in his blog:
456	Here comes my question, can I throw my shoe at you?	30 ነበር፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
457	As my freedom is harmed in this country, I am here to protect my freedom.	ሲጀመርም ሲማ ናን የዩንቨርስቲውን አስተዳዳሪ ሊ ጂንባዎንን በማወደስ ጀመሩት፡፡	Since then, Simin started to praise the University's governor, Lee Jin-won. If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
458	Another student describes the scene in his blog:	በእውነት ማካበድ ይችሉበታል፡፡	If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
459	The talk started at 7:30. At the beginning Sima Nan kept praising our university headmaster Li Jianbao, he is really good at flattering.	የአስተዳዳሪው ስብእናም በቅፅበት ማደግ ጀመረ፡፡	The manager's character grew exponentially. If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
460	Then he pretended to be very open minded said that he was aware that some people wanted to throw things at him and invited them to throw stuff.	አሰከትለውም በጣም ግልፅ ለመምሰል ሞከሩ እናም አንዳንድ ሰዎችም የተለያዩ ነገሮችን ሊወረውሩ እንደሚችሉ ይገባኛል አይነት ሀሳብ በማምጣት፤ ለዛም ዝግጁ እንደሆኑ ገለፁ፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
461	Since he had not started talking, people were not ready to throw things.	ከዛም አራት ነጥቦችን ብቻ አስቀምጠው ቀሪውን ጊዜ ለጥያቄ እና መልስ እንደሚያዉሉት ቃል ገቡ፡፡	They then simply took four points and promised to use the rest of the time for questions and answers.
462	Then he promised that he would focus on making four points and leave more time for exchange.	ንግግራቸው ረጅም፣ አሰልች እና በስህተቶች የተሞላ ነበር፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
463	I was too naive to believe him.	አራት ነጥብ ያሉትም 1.	There are four points.
464	His talk was long, boring and full of mistakes.	በፓርቲ አመራር ውስጥ ብዙ ማህበራዊ ችግሮች ይኖራሉ 2.	2. There are many social problems in the leadership of the party.
465	His four points were: 1.	የፓርቲው አመራሮች ብዙ ስኬቶች እንዳስመዘገቡ 3.	The party leaders have achieved many successes.
466	The party leaders have great achievements; 3. Without the party society would be in chaos; 4.	ያለ ፓርቲ ህብረተሰቡ ማጥ ውስጥ እንደሚዘፈቅ 4 የዜጎች ዲሞክራሲ ከፓርቲው አመራር መነጠል እንደማይችሉ ናቸው፡፡	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
467	People's democracy should not be detached from party leadership.	በንግግራቸው መካከልም አንድ ሰው ወደ አዳራሹ ሊገባ ሲል በጠባቂዎች ተከለከለ፡፡	In their conversation, a man was blocked from entering the hall. If you cannot translate, just say you don't know.
468	In the middle of his talk, someone tried to enter the hall but was stopped by the security guards.	ከአንድ ሰዓት ከሰላሳ ደቂቃ ንግግር በኋላ ሲማ ናና ንግግራቸውን አቆሙ፡፡	After one hour and forty minutes of speech, Shyam ended his speech.
469	The climax was unexpected.	የጥያቄ እና መለስ ጊዜውም ተጀመረ፡፡	The time for questions and answers also began. If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
470	Sima Nan finally had enough of his talk after one and a half hours.	ከኔ ፊት ለፊትም አንድ ብርቱካናማ የስፖርት ልብስ ለበሰ ሰው መናገር ጀመረ፡፡	Then a man in a blue athletics shirt started to talk to me.
471	The Q & A session started.	ንግግሩንም ከግሪኩ ፈላስፋ ሶቅራጠስ ንግግር ጠቅሶ ጀመረ፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
472	In front of me a man dressed in orange sport wear started talking.	ዝርዝር ሁኔታዎችን አስገራሚ ስለነበሩ ዘንግቻቸዋለሁ፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
473	His main point was about freedom and equality.	የንግግሩ ዋነኛ ነጥብም ነፃነት እና እኩልነት ነበር፡፡	The main point of his speech was freedom and equality.
474	He said: Today we don't have equality in our rights to speak. I have no freedom.	ምንም እንኳን የተናገሩት ጥሩ ነገር ባይሆንም፣ ወደ ሆቴልዎት መመለስ ይችላሉ፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
475	What you have said are politically correct theories. When you are done, you go back to your hotel.	ነገር ግን እኔ ንግግሩን ብቃወም ትንሽ ጨለማ ክፍል ውስጥ እንደሚዘጋብኝ እርግጠኛ ነኝ ፡፡	But I'm sure if I don't reject the conversation I will be locked in a dark room .
476	If I argue against that I would be locked up in a tiny dark room (This is all I can remember, sorry).	(ይህ እኔ ላስታውስ የቻልኩት ነገር ነው፣ አዝናለሁ) ፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence, just say you don't know (I can't remember that, sorry).
477	Then Sima Nan said that it was not a question. The student then replied, Here comes my question, can I throw my shoe?	ሲማ ናን አስከትለው ይህ ጥያቄ አይደለም አሉ፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
478	Then he threw a sports shoe to the stage with determination.	ተማሪውም ሲመልስ የኔ ጥያቄ ይሄው ነው፣ ጫማየን መወርወር እችላለሁ; ከዛም በቁርጠኝነት የለበሰውን የስፖርት ጫማ ወደ መድረኩ ወረወረ፡፡	"The student replied, ""My question is this, can I drop my shoes?"" He then stood up and stood up and stood up with his athletic shoes."
479	I clapped my hand without being aware of that…	እኔም ሳላስበው አጨበጭብ ነበር…	I was also laughing without realizing...
480	Sima Nan is a Maoist and in the past few years he has kept praising the North Korean model in China to advocate for a stricter approach to foreign policy.	ሲማ ናን ማኦይስት ሲሆኑ ባለፉት ጥቂት አመታት ውስጥ የሰሜን ኮሪያ ሞዴል በጫይናም እንዲዳብር እና በውጭ ጉዳዮች ላይ ጠንካራ አካሄድ እንዲኖር ይፈልጋሉ፡፡	Since the last few years, Kim Nam-ae has wanted to promote the South Korean model in the clothes and to have a strong stance on foreign issues.
481	He has also propagated a lot of hate speech against liberals, accusing them of being traitors of the country.	በተጨማሪም ለዘብተኞች ላይ የጥላቻ ንግግር በማድረግ እና የሀገሪቱ ስጋቶች ናቸው በሚል ውንጀላቸው ታዋቂ ናቸው፡፡	They are also famous for their hate speech and accusations of being the country's threats.
482	Many have applauded the student's courageous act, but some are also worried about the student's safety.	ብዙ ተማሪዎች የተማሪውን ደፋር ተግባር ያደነቁ ሲሆን አንዳንዶች ግን የተማሪው ደህንነት አሳስቧቸዋል፡፡	Many students applauded the student's bravery, but some asked for the student's safety.
483	Below is my pick of the online discussion :	ከዚህ በታች በድረ ገፅ ስለሁኔታው የነበረውን ውይይት በኔ ምርጫ አቅርቤያለሁ:	I've chosen to display the discussion on the situation below. If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
484	慕容雪村: Sima Nan calls himself an intellectual and upholds Maoist ideology.	ምንአልባትም በማኦ ዘመን ስለተካሄደው ማሰቃየት እና ጥቃት ዘንግተውት ይሆናል፡፡	You may have forgotten about the torture and murder that took place in the Ming dynasty.
485	He has probably forgotten about the torture and insult intellectuals went though in the Mao Era - they were forced to wear tall hats and rally on the street, beaten by belts with copper locks, forced into labour on cattle farms to reflect upon their wrongs.	- በዛን ወቅት ሰዎች ረጅም ኮፍያ አጥልቀው በመንገድ ይነዱ ነበር፣ በብረት ቀበቶም ይገረፉ ነበር ፣ከብት በመጠበቅ ስራ ላይ እንዲሰማሩ በማድረግ ስህተታቸውን እንዲያምኑ ይደረጉ ነበር፡፡	If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
486	Zhang Zhixin had his throat cut, Wang Shiwei was buried in a well after a secret execution.	ዛነግ ዚን አንገቱን ተቆርጧል፣ ዋንግ ሰዊ በድብቅ ከተገደለ በኋላ ጉድጓድ ውስጥ ተቀብሯል፡፡	Zhou Jin was cut off the head, and Wang Xiao was buried in a cave after being murdered in secret.
487	Lao She and Fu Lei committed suicide… Throwing shoe at him is like a reward.	ላኦ ሺ እና ፉ ሊ ራሳቸውን አጥፍተዋል… ጫማ ወደ እራሳቸው መወርወሩ ለእራሳቸው እንደ ሽልማት ነው፡፡	Lao Shi and Fu Li killed themselves... throwing shoes at themselves is like a reward.
488	吴钩1975: Many are debating about the student's act on Weibo.	吴钩1975￼፡	只翻译翻译。如果不能翻译, simply say you don't know.
489	Some clapped their hands, some criticized the student for infringing other's rights.	በዊቦ ብዙዎች ስለ ተማሪው ድርጊት እየተከራከሩ ይገኛሉ፡፡	Many people in Whoop are arguing about the student's actions. If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
490	We should have some consensus in understanding the nature of throwing shoes.	አንዳንዶች አጨብጭበዋል፣ ሌሎች ደግሞ የሌሎቹን መብት መጣስ ተገቢ አይደለም እያሉ ይተቻሉ፡፡	Some laughed, others argued that other people's rights were not being violated.
491	I don't agree that throwing shoes is an attack.	ጫማ ስለመወርወር ጉዳይ ስምምነት ላይ መድረስ ይኖርብናል፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
492	It is just a form of protest by the weak side in a situation when the power is not equal.	እኔ ጫማን መወርወር ጥቃት ነው ብየ አላስብም፤ ይልቅስ ደካማው ወገን ተቃውሞውን የሚገልጽበት መንገድ ነው፡፡	I don't think throwing a baton is a threat; it's a way for the weak to express their disagreement.
493	It is quite commonly seen in western countries when people throw eggs at government officials. Don't label the act.	በምዕራብ ሀገሮች ወደ ባለስልጣናት እንቁላል መወርወር በጣም የተለመደ እና እንደ ጥፋት የማይይጠር ድርጊት ነው፡፡	In Eastern countries, throwing eggs at officials is a very common and unavoidable act.
494	十年砍柴: One should not cheer for the student.	十年砍柴: ሰዎች በተማሪው ድርጊት ደስ ሊላቸው አይገባም፡፡	十年砍柴: People should not be happy with the student's behavior.
495	In western countries, throwing eggs and shoes are common forms of expression and the punishment is light.	በምእራብ ሀገሮች እንቁላል መወርወር መብት አካል ሲሆን ቅጣቱም እዚህ ግባ የማይባል ነው፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
496	But in China, the risk is very high.	ነገር ግን በቻይና አደጋው ብዙ ነው፡፡	But in China the danger is very high.
497	This time Sima Nan does not have the power to punish the student.	ሲማ ናን ተማሪውን መቅጣት ስልጣን የለውም፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
498	But if other hot blooded students are encouraged and decide to throw shoes at those who have real authority, the price is too huge.	ነገር ግን ድርጊቱን እንደ ተሞክሮ በመውሰድ ሌሎች ተማሪዎች ይሄን ድርጊት ስልጣኑ ያላቸው ሰዎች ላይ ከፈፀሙት፤ የሚከፍሉት ዋጋ ከባድ ነው፡፡	But if other students took this act as a lesson, they would pay a heavy price if they did it against the authority.

526	@mpalele: The sad part abt this Campus Divas for Rich Men is that they think 50K , coffee java and a trip 2 naivasha is the definition of a rich man.	@mpalele: ስለነዚህ የካምፓስ ቀውጢ-ቺኮች ለሀብታሞች አሳዛኙ ጉዳይ 50,000፣ ቡና እና ጥቂት ጉዞ የሀብታም ሰው ትርጉም ይመስላቸዋል፡፡	@mpalele: For these castle-crazed chicks for the rich, 50,000, beer and a few trips seem like a rich man's meaning.

543	Tens of thousands showed up in the areas of Mishref and Sabah Al-Salem protesting the Kuwaiti ruler's amendment of the voting law, which now allows a citizen to vote for one candidate instead of four.	የኪዌት መሪዎች የመምረጥ መብት ህግን በመከለሳቸው በሚሽረፍ እና ሳባህ አል ሳሌም አከባቢዎች በአስር ሺዎች የሚቆጠሩ ሰዎች ተቃውሟቸውን ሲያሰሙ ታይተዋል፡፡ ይህ ህግ አንድ ዜጋ ለአራት እጩ ተወዳዳሪዎች የሚሰጠውን ድምጽ ወደ አንድ ያወርደዋል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
544	Protesters did not find the Amir's decree constitutional and believe the new law is made to play with the coming elections in December and to weaken the opposition that won most of the parliament's seats earlier this year.	ተቃዋሚዎቹ የአሚሩን ውሳኔ ሕገ መንግስታዊ ሆኖ አላገኙትም አዲሱ ህግ የተዘጋጀው በዚህ ዓመት ቀድሞ አብዛኛውን የፓርላማ ወንበር ያሸነፈውን ተቃዋሚ ፓርቲ በመጪው ታህሳስ በሚካሂደው ምርጫ ላይ ለማዳከም ነው ብለው ያምናሉ፡፡	Critics say the amendment was not constitutional. The new law was designed to weaken the opposition party in the upcoming parliamentary election in December.
545	Like the previous march, Sunday's protest witnessed smoke and tear gas bombs and several arrests of protesters, who were later released.	እንደ መጀመሪያው ሰልፍ ዕለተ ሰንበት የአስለቃሽ ጢስ እና ቦንቦችን ሰለባ የሆኑ ሲሆን በርካቶችም ከታሰሩ በኋላም መለቀቃቸው ታውቋል፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
546	Who is leading the protests?	ተቃውሞውን የሚመራው ማነው ?	Who is leading the protest?
547	In the past few years, protests were criticized because they were led by opposition MPs.	ባለፉት ጥቂት አመታት አመጸኞቹ በተቃዋሚ የፓርላማ አባላት በመመራታቸው ትችት ደርሶባቸዋል፤ በኋላ ወጣቶቹ የተቃውሞው መሪዎች ለመሆን ጥረት አድርገዋል፡፡	In recent years, protesters have been criticized for being led by opposition MPs, and then young people have tried to become the leaders of the protest.
548	Lately, the youth tried to be the leaders of those protests. This shift got bigger numbers to show up for those dignity marches.	ይህ ለውጥ የክብር ሰልፎች ላይ የተሳተፉ ሰዎች ቁጥር እንዲያሻቅብ አድርጎታል፡፡	This change has made the number of people participating in the awards to rise. If you can't translate it simply say you don't know.
549	What is interesting though is that an anonymous Twitter account is the one deciding dates of both marches and the meeting points.	ሌላው አስገራሚ የሚያደርገው ነገር ደግሞ የሁለቱም ሰልፎች ቀንና መነሻ ቦታ የተወሰነው በህቡዕ የትዊተር ገጽ መሆኑ ነው፡፡	Other interesting thing is that both rallies were scheduled on a secret Twitter page.
550	The account @KarametWatan tweeted a message on the 24th of October to Twitter not to revel their identity to the Kuwaiti authorities:	ጥቅምት 24 @KarametWatan (በአረብኛ የሀገር ክብር) የተሰኘ የትዊተር ገጽ ትዊተር ማንነታቸውን ለኪዌት መንግስት አሳልፎ እንዳይገልጥ የሚጠይቅ መልዕክት በትዊተር አስተላለፈ፡፡	@KarametWatan (in Arabic: وطن الوطن) on October 24 tweeted a message asking Twitter not to reveal their identity to the Kuwaiti government.

If you can't translate the event, just say you don't know.
553	The turn-out reached over 150,000 (around 11.5% of citizens of Kuwait) that stunned the government.	ይህ ግልብጥ ብሎ የወጣው ከ150, 000 በላይ ቁጥር ያለው ህዝብ(ከጠቅላላው የከዌት ዜጋ 11.	This is a total of 150, 000 people (11% of the total population of Rwanda).
554	In return the government ordered their forces to attack the peaceful demonstration in a brutal manner that was never been seen before for no reason.	በምላሹም መንግስት በአውሬነት፣ ያለምክንያት፣ ከዚህ በፊት ታይቶ በማይታወቅ መልኩ ይህን ሰላማዊ ሰልፍ እንዲያጠቁ ሀይሎቹን አዟል፡፡	In response, the government ordered the forces to attack this protest without reason, in a way never seen before.
555	Over 100 people were injured and over 50 were detained in an unlawful manner.	ከመቶ በላይ ሰዎች ሲጎዱ ከሀምሳ በላይ የሚሆኑት ደግም በህገወጥ መልኩ ወህኒ ወርደዋል፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.

559	Should Bahrainis support Kuwaitis?	ባህሬናውያን ኪዌቶችን ደግፈዋልን?	Are Brazilians supporting the Cubans?
560	Considering the sectarian remarks and support of Kuwaiti opposition figures for the Bahraini regime against the February 14th revolution, the Shia of Kuwait do not want to protest next to the opposition.	የጎጠኞቹን ሐተታ ግምታ ውስጥ በማሰገባትና የኪዌት ተቃዋሚ መሪዎች የጥር 14 አብዮት የባህሬንን ስርዓት በመደገፋቸው፤ የኪዌት ሻይቶች ከተቃዋሚዎች ጎን ሆነው መሰለፍ አይፈልጉም፡፡	Because of the political debate and the support of the opposition leaders of the January 14 revolution, the Knights of the Ivory Coast doesn't want to stand with the opposition.
561	This, in result, influenced the Shia of Bahrain and started a discussion on whether Bahrainis should or should not support Kuwaiti marches.	በውጤቱም የተፅእኖ ወስጥ የወደቀው ባህሬናዊ ሻይት ሰልፉን መደገፍ እንዳለባቸውና መደገፍ እንደሌለባቸው ውይይት ጀምሯል፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.

596	Ethiopia has been elected to be a member the United Nations Human Rights Council.	ኢትዮጵያ የተባበሩት መንግስታት ሰብአዊ መብት ኮሚሽን አባል ሀገር ሆና ተመረጠች።	Ethiopia was chosen to be a member of the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
597	Which Ethiopia?	የትኛዋ ኢትዮጵያ! ?	What is the name of Ethiopia!
598	Which Human Right?	የትኛው ሰብአዊ መብት!	What human rights do you know?
599	Which United Nations Human Rights Council?	የትኛው የተባበሩት መንግስታት የሰብአዊ መብት ኮሚሽን!	If you can't translate simply say you don't know which UN Human Rights Commission!
600	Is it not worrisome that an Ethiopian sense of discomfiture is not shared by our government?	እኔ የምለው ኢትዮጵያዊው የዩልኝታ ባህላችን ያለው ህብረተሰቡ ዘንድ ብቻ መሆኑ በጣም አሳሳቢ ችግር አይመስላችሁም?	I think that the Ethiopian hospitality culture is very serious problem. If you can't translate it simply say you don't know.
601	If our government had any Ethiopian sense of discomfiture, they would have rejected when they got elected as a member the United Nations Human Rights Council!	እንዴ መንግስት እኮ ይሉኝታ ቢኖረው ኖሮ ተመድ የሰባዊ መብት ኮሚሽን አባል አድርጌ መርጨሀለሁ!	If you can't translate simply say you don't know
602	They would have admitted that the Ethiopian government would not fit in the Human Rights Council but our government never had an Ethiopian sense of discomfiture and accepted the membership to United Nations Human Rights Council gladly!	” ሲለው… አረ በህግ አምላክ እኔ አልሆናችሁም ሀገር ተሳስታችሁ ነው! ወይ ደግሞ ባታውቁኝ ነው የመረጣችሁኝ…! ” ማለት ነበረበት።	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
603	They even went on to declare that the Ethiopian government has a good human right record!	ነገር ግን መንግስቴ ምን ይሉኝ” ያልፈጠረበት ነውና አሜን ብ ሎ መቀበሉ ሲገርመን፤ ጭራሽ በአደባባይ እንዲህ ነን እኛ ሰብአዊ መብት ጠባቂዎች” ተብሎ ተነገረን!	"But when the government says ""What do you say to me?"" it makes us wonder; because we were told in public that we were ""human rights activists."""
604	Zerihun Tesfaye, an exiled journalist and blogger, described the conundrum of Ethiopia’s election in an extended Amharic note on Facebook:	በደረሰበት ጫና ከሀገር የተሰደደው ጋዜጠኛ እና ጦማሪ ዘሪሁን ተስፋዬ በፌስቡክ ገጹ ይህን ለማመን የሚከብድ ‘የኢትዮጵያ መመረጥ’ እንዲህ ሲል ገልጾታል፡፡	While he was in prison, a journalist and blogger, Zarin Taufey, who was forced to leave the country, has written on his Facebook page that he is shocked by the 'Ethiopian Election'.
605	Let me chant, I can’t, I can’t as she has forgotten my cause!	እስቲ ልነሳና ልበል አልቸም አልቸም	Let me get up and say sorry.
606	Says a local songster.	እሷ የኔን ነገር ትተዋለች መቼም የሠፈራችን አዝማሪ።	She always leaves my things alone, because she is our singer.
607	I find it easy to join this local songster and chant with him when we fall upon international organizations and governments who deafen their ears to our cause!	አንዲህ ነገር ዓለሙን የተዉ ግለሰቦች፣ ዓለም አቀፍ ተቋማት እና መንግሥታት ሲያጋጥሙ አዝማሪውን ተቀብሎ ማንጎራጎሩ ሳይቀል አይቀርም።	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know
608	But paradoxically, sometimes international organizations have a better understanding than Ethiopians themselves, about horrendous human right situations in Ethiopia and we feel better as we consider the international community is recognizing our great efforts.	ስለኢትዮጵያ መንግሥት ሰብዓዊ መብት ረገጣ አንዳንዴ እኛን ባለጉዳዮቹን በሚያስደንቅ ኹኔታ የዓለም ዓቀፉ ማኅበረሰብ ሲያቀነቅን ወይ ጉድ ለካንስ እነዚህ ሰዎች የልብ አውቃ ኖረዋል ብለን ተስፋ እናደርጋለን።	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
609	Sometimes we even think the international community is part of the revolution we aspire to in Ethiopia and our hearts fill with joy!	አንድ ቀን የለውጡ አካል ሆነው የነጻነታችንን እንቀዳጃለን ብለንም ልባችን በሐሴት ትሞላለች።	If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
610	So through journalism we used to report a lot on human rights abuse in Ethiopia.	እናም የጋዜጠኝነት ሙያችንም የረዳንን ያህል የማቃጠር ሥራ እንሠራለን።	We only work on translation if you cannot translate. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
611	For instance, if we report fifty innocent Ethiopians are jailed in a famous prison called Kality” some of the international community members correct us with more accurate number (120) of innocent prisoners including their names!	ሌሎች የማይጠቀሱ ጉዳዮች ተደራርበው ትላንት የተባበሩት መንግሥታት የሰብዓዊ መብቶች ካውንስል ይህቺን በሰብዓዊ መብት አያያዝ የማትጠረጠር አገር አባል አድርጎ ሲመርጥ ግን የሠፈሬን አዝማሪ ማስታወስ ግድ አለኝ።	Other unmentioned issues have accumulated when the United Nations Human Rights Committee chose to recognize this country as a non-suspected member of the Human Rights Council yesterday.
612	Then we feel these people are with us and hope good things are yet to come!	በእውነት እነዚህ የመብት ተሟጋቾች እና ተቋማት ተስፋ ሊያስቆርጡን እየሞከሩ ነው?	Does this really mean that these rights activists and organizations are trying to derail us?
613	But when I heard of the news of Ethiopia’s election to the United Nations Human Rights Council last evening, the hymn of our local songster rang a bell!	ወይስ በየትኛውም መስፈርት አገርን ለማስተዳደር ብቃቱ የሌለው ቦዘኔ መንግሥት ምን አልባት አባል ሲሆን የጠባይ ለውጥ ያመጣ ይኾን ብለው?	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
614	Are these intergovernmental human rights organizations trying to destroy our optimism?	አሁን አሁን እየተፎጋግርን ያለን ያህል ተሰማኝ።	I feel like we're fighting.
615	Or do they think a bad-mannered government will get better when it becomes a member of United Nations Human Rights Council?	ክፋቱ አሁንም የእነሱን ድጋፍ የምንፈልግ መሆናችን፤ የለማኝ ስልቻ ቢንከባለል ከለማኝ ደጅ እንዲሉ።	The problem is that we still want their support; a hammer spins from the hammer's side.
616	Nowadays I feel everybody has become politically correct to everybody!	ሌላው ያገባኛል ያለው የበየነ መረብ ቀበኛ ዮሐንስ ሞላ ይህን ጻፈ፡፡	Others who believe me wrote this, John Moll.
617	But the worse thing is still we need their help!	እማር በሰር ጫሪም፣ ጒቸ ገግት ቧሪም፡፡	I am a bitch, I am a bitch, I am a bitch.
618	And another concerned netizen, Yohanes Molla, wrote :	” የጉራግኛ ተረትና ምሳሌ (ወማካ) ነው፡፡	This is a Greek myth and example (Wamkha). If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
619	There is a local proverb which says: A fool makes a donkey carry red meat and sends her along with a hyena!	ወደ አማርኛ ሲመጣ አህያ ላይ ስጋ ጭነው፣ ጅብን ሸኝ አሉት፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
620	So the hyena will chomp through the red meat and later turn on the donkey!	እንግዲህ ይህ ሲሆን ውጤቱ ግልፅ ነው፡፡	So, this is the result. If you can't translate the sentence, just say you don't know.
621	However, when I woke up this morning I could not escape this story!	ምናልባት አህያዋንም ጠግቦ ካቆያት ነው እንጂ እርሷንም በጊዜ ይበላታል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
622	It keeps coming back to me and makes my day horrific!	ትናንት ማምሻውን በእንቅልፍ ልቤ አንብቤው….	I read it in my sleep last night....
623	So what could better describe Ethiopia’s election to United Nations Human Rights Council other than the proverb I cited above!	’ እያልኩ ተኝቼ፣ ዛሬ ስነቃ እውን ሆኖ የደገመኝና እስካሁን ድረስ በአህምሮዬ ላይ ተተክሎ ቀኔን ያጠቆረብኝና፣ እያቃጨለብኝ ያለውን ኢትዮጵያ የተመድ የሰብዓዊ መብት ካውንስል አባል የመሆን ወሬ ጉዳይ ከዚህ ተረትና ምሳሌ የተሸለ ምን ይገልፀው ይሆን?	‘I was sleeping, and when I got up, it turned out to be true, and I still have it in my mind, and I still have it in my mind.’
624	Jawar Mohammed wrote a detailed analysis of how Ethiopia secured a seat in the council.	ዳንኤል ብርሃነ ግን የኢትዮጵያን የምክር ቤት አባልነት ከሚቃወሙት ጋር አይስማማም፡፡	Daniel Berhane doesn't agree with those who oppose the membership of the Ethiopian Parliament.
625	But Daniel Berehane disagreed with those opposing Ethiopia's membership to the council:	የኢትዮጵያ ለተባበሩት መንግስታት ሰብዓዊ መብቶች ምክር ቤት መመረጥ ምንም ጥመት አላየኹበትም፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
626	I see no anomaly with Ethiopia being elected to the UN Human Rights Council. Both Ethiopia and the Council have good Constitutions.	ሁለቱም፤ ኢትዮጵያም ምክር ቤቱም ጥሩ ሀገ መንግስት አላቸው፡፡	Both nations, Ethiopia and the Parliament, have a good constitution. If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
627	They both have capacity (political, financial, etc) limitations implementing it.	ሁለቱም ለትግበራ የአቅም (ፖለቲካዊ፣ የገንዘብ ወዘተ.	Both have the capacity to operate (political, financial, etc.)
628	Perfect match.	ፍጹም ጥምረት!	If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
629	Human rights groups have been criticizing Ethiopia as one of the most serious human rights violators in Africa with huge number of dissidents, activists and journalists languishing in jail.	ኢትዮጵያ የሰብዓዊ መብት ተሟጋቾች ከፍተኛ የሰብዓዊ መብት ጥሰት ያካሄዳሉ ብለው ከሚከሷቸው የአፍሪካ ሀገሮች አንዷ ስትሆን በተጨማሪም በርካታ ተቃዋሚዎች፣ አራማጆችና ጋዜጠኞች በወህኒ የሚሰቃዩባት ናት፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. Ethiopia is one of the African countries where human rights activists are being accused of serious human rights violations, and where many protesters, activists and journalists are imprisoned.
630	The reports have not been received well by some netizens.	ይህ የባቡር መሥመር የአቡነ ጴጥሮስንና የዐፄ ምኒሊክን ሐውልት እንዲነሡ ያደርጋል?	This train line will cause the statue of St. Peter and St. James to be destroyed?
631	It was in 1896 that Ethiopian forces led by Emperor Menelik II had defeated an Italian army with better contemporary military technology at the Battle of Adwa.	በወቅቱ የኢትዮጵያ ንጉሰ ነገስት የነበሩት አጼ ምኒልክ መላውን የኢትዮጵያ ህዝብ ከጎናቸው አሰልፈው የጊዜውን ዘመናዊ መሳሪያ የታጠቀውን የጣሊያን ጦር አድዋ ላይ ድል አደረጉ፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know

633	For his triumph at Adwa and for his endeavor to change Ethiopia in his own ways, a statue in his honor was erected at the center of Addis Ababa called Arada.	ለዚህ የአድዋ ድልና ሀገሪቱ ዘመናዊ እንድትሆን ላደረጉት ጥረት መታሰቢያ ይሆን ዘንድ ይህ ሐውልት በመሐል አዲስ አበባ አራዳ ጊዮርጊስ ቆመላቸው፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

635	Almost forty years later, in 1935, the Italians launched a new but a prearranged military campaign endorsed by their then belligerent leaders.	ከመጀመሪያዎቹ ኢትዮጵያውን ጳጳሳት አንዱ የሆኑት ብፁዕ አቡነ ጴጥሮስ እጃቸውን ተይዘው ማርሻል ግራዚያኒ ፊት ቀረቡ፡፡	Blessed Peter was one of the first Ethiopian popes to appear before Mary Gracie.
636	The Italians managed to have a brief military occupation of Ethiopia but faced a staunch resistance from Ethiopians.	የኢትዮጵያ መሬት ጠላትን ብትቀበል የተረገመች ትሁን፡፡	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.

639	He was forced to appear before General Rodolfo Graziani to submit and declare the Ethiopian patriots as bandits.	አለመሞታቸው ሲታወቅ ከግራዚያኒ አዛዦች አንዱ በሦስት የሽጉጥ ጥይት ራሳቸውን በመምታት ገደላቸው፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
640	He refused to comply with their demand and condemned the aggressors instead. He asked Ethiopians to struggle for their freedom. Finally, the Italians executed him in public.	ይህን ለሀገር ነጻነት የከፈሉትን መስዋዕትነት ለማዘከር በግፍ ከተገደሉበት ቦታ በቅርብ ርቀት ሐውልት ተሰራላቸው፡፡	If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
641	As it was done with Emperor Menelik II, a statue of Abune Petros was built at the center of Addis Ababa as reminiscent of his unwavering stand for his country.	ይሁንና ከቻይናው ሪልዌይ ግሩፕ ሊሚትድ ጋር በመተባበር የከተማ ባቡር መስመር ለመዘርጋት ያቀደው የኢትዮጵያ መንግስት እነዚህን ሁለት ሐውልቶች ሊያፈርስ መዘጋጁቱ ብዙ ኢትዮጵያውያንን አስቆጥቷል፡፡	But the Ethiopian government is preparing to demolish these two monuments, which were designed by the Chinese railways group limited, in a bid to build a city railway. If you cannot translate the two monuments simply say you don't know.
642	However, unconfirmed reports are circulating online that the two iconic statues found on an historical thoroughfare might get wrecked due to an Addid Ababa rail tunnel construction project.	ስለኢትዮጵያ ታሪክ ባሕል እምነት ፖለቲካ እና ትውፊት ምልከታውን የሚያቀርበው ዳንኤል ክብረት መሠረታዊ ጥያቄውን በማስቀድም ትችቱን አስከተለ፡፡	Daniel K. asked the fundamental question before he started his criticism of the Ethiopian history, culture, religion, politics and tradition.
643	The reports have not been received well by some netizens.	ይህ የባቡር መሥመር የአቡነ ጴጥሮስንና የዐፄ ምኒሊክን ሐውልት እንዲነሡ ያደርጋል?	This train line will cause the statue of St. Peter and St. James to be destroyed?

652	So constructing rail lines at the cost of Ethiopia’s iconic figures is like going to a barber shop for hair cut after amputating one’s head!	ለነጻነት የተሠውትን የአቡነ ጴጥሮስ ሐውልት ነቅሎ በባቡር ላይ በነጻነት ለመሄድ መከጀል ግፍ መሥራት ነው የሚሆነው፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.

655	Abush Zekaryas relates an incident related to the recent controversy, which erupted in Italy after a small town east of Rome built a memorial to a Fascist military leader, General Rodolfo Graziani, using public funds.	ነገር ግን እጅግ ጥልቅ የዐሳብ ድህነት ያጠቃቸው የከተማችን ንድፍ ሰሪዎች መስመሩን ለመዘርጋት ከፍተኛ ዋጋ የሚሰጣቸውን ታላላቅ የታሪክ ምልክቶችን የሚዘክሩ ሁለት ሐውልቶች ለማፍረስ ወይም ቦታቸውን መቀየር አለብን ብለዋል?	But those who are very poor at thinking have called for demolition or relocation of two monumental monuments that deserve a lot of attention to the expansion of the city.
656	While some Italians built a memorial to a Fascist military leader, there is a rumor that Ethiopians are set to demolish the iconic statues of Menelik II and Abune Petros!	ጧት ጉዞ ላይ ሳለሁ፤ ፋና ሬዲዮ ይፈርሳሉ ተብሎ እየተወራ ያለው የአጼ ምኒልክ እና የአቡነ ጴጥሮስ ኅውልቶች የማህበራዊ ድረ-ገጾች የሚያናፍሱት ያልተጣራ አሉባልታ እንደሆነ ነገረን።	Yesterday morning, while I was on a trip, I heard that the rumors about the demolition of the Ferdinand and the Cardinal Peter's tombs were a fake news.

660	Why are the statues and historical places of our forefathers who have contributed a lot for Ethiopia not given due emphasis during planning?	የአውሮፓ የጥንት ከተሞች ላይ ያሉ ኅውልቶችም ሆኑ የቅርስ ቦታዎች በመሰረተ ግንባታ ምክንያት ሲፈርሱ ሰምቼም አይቼም አላውቅም።	I have never heard or seen a memorial or cultural site being demolished because of structural expansion in European ancient cities.

662	However, pro-government media, Fana Broadcasting Corporate, has a self contradictory story on their website denying the iconic statues will be demolished for rail lines construction! :	ምናልባት ህዝቡን ለማሳመን መንግስት ይህንንም እንደሌሎቹ ልምዶች (የምርጫ የስነ-ምግባር ህግ፣.

664	However, as the Addis Ababa rail tunnel project passes through the iconic thoroughfare it will momentarily dig up the Abune Petros statue and it will not get anywhere near the statue of Menelik II.	እኛ እያልን ያለነው ሀገሪቱ ላይ የሚሰሩ ፕሮጀክቶች ለምን ቅድመ ጥናት ሲካሄድ የእምነትና የሐውልት ቦታዎች ፤ የአባቶቻችን ለቤተክርስቲያንም ሆነ ለኢትዮጵያ አሻራቸውን ያስቀመጡበት ቦታ ከግምት ውስጥ አይገባም ?

667	Kwame Nkrumah's statue, which was unveiled at the African Union (AU) headquarters, which was built with help of the Chinese government, has also sparked anger amongst Ethiopians as many Ethiopians feel that the country's former leader Haile Selassie also deserved recognition.	ከዚህ በፊት በቻይና መንግስት በተገነባው የአፍሪካ ህብረት አዳራሽ ቅፅር ግቢ ውስጥ የአፍሪካ አባት ተብለው የሚጠሩት ቀዳማዊ አጼ ኃይለ ሥላሴን በመተው ለጋናዊው ክዋሜ ንክሩማህ መሰራቱ ብዙዎችን እንዳስከፋ የሚታወስ ነው፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know
668	It has been three months since Meles Zenawi, the late Ethiopian Prime Minister, was formally declared dead at the age of 57 after months of speculation as to his whereabouts.	የቀድሞው ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር መለስ ዜናዊ የት ይሆኑ ይሆን በሚለው ላይ ወራት የዘለቀው ግምት አቧርቶ በ57 ዓመታቸው ከዚህ ዓለም በሞት እንደተለዩ በመደበኛ መንገድ ከተገለጸ ወዲህ ሦስት ወራት ተቆጥረዋል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

670	As his legacy continues to be discussed in various international mainstream media, Ethiopians have been taking to social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to reflect on his legacy.	የመለስ ውርስ በዓለም መገናኛ ብዙኃን በመወራት ላይ ባለበት ጊዜ ኢትዮጵያውያን የመለስ ውርስ የሚባለው ጉዳይ ላይ የራሳቸውን ሐሳብ ሊያንፀባርቁ በፌስቡክ እና ትዊተር ላይ ብቅ ብለዋል፡፡	If you can't translate the issue simply say you don't know.

677	On one of major unpleasant chapters in Zenawi's legacy, Abiye Teklemariam writes:	በሌላም እንዲሁ በሚያስቆጨው የመለስ ውርስ ላይ ዐብይ የሚከተለውን ጻፈ:-	In another disturbing article, Prime Minister Ayad wrote that:

680	I am sure many of the people who were singing the praises of our late PM immediately after his death doesn’t even know who these people are.	በርግጠኝነት ከቀድሞው ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር ሞት በኋላ መለስን በማሞገስ የሚያቀነቅኑት ሰዎች የታሰሩት ሰዎች እነማን እንደሆኑም ከነጭራሹ አያውቁም፡፡	If you cannot translate, just say you don't know.
681	However, some consider Meles Zenawi a visionary leader and believe that his legacy should be maintained. In a Facebook post, Jossy Romanat recounts a conversation he had about the legacy of Meles Zenawi with his friend: A Sunday conversation between Me and My Friend (MF).	ምንም እንኳን መለስ ዜናዊ ባለራዕይ ናቸው ቢባሉም እና ውርሳቸውም መቀጠል አለበት እየተባለ ቢሆንም፤ በፌስቡክ ጽሑፉ ጆሲ ራማናት ስለመለስ ውርስ ከጓደኛው ጋር የተነጋገረውን ይዘረዝራል:-	Although although Prime Minister of Myanmar is a visionary, and his legacy should continue, a Facebook post by Jamie Ramney explains what he spoke to his friend about the legacy of Prime Minister of Myanmar.
682	MF: Do you think PM.	የእሁድ ዕለት የኔና የጓደኛዬ ውይይት	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
683	Meles Zenawi was a great leader?	ጓደኛዬ:- መለስ ዜናዊ ታላቅ መሪ የነበሩ ይመስልሃል?	My friend:- Do you think that Mohammed Zinian was a great leader?
684	ME: Yes indeed!	እኔ:- አዎ እርግጥ ነው!	I: Yes, I know!
685	He was a great leader and probably the best Ethiopia has seen so far.	ታላቅ መሪ ብቻ ሳይሆን ምናልባት ኢትዮጵያ ያየችው ምርጡ መሪያችንም ነበሩ፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
686	However, this doesn’t mean he wasn’t irreplaceable, as you always believe. MF:- If you think PM.	ነገር ግን ይህ ማለት አንተ ብዙ ጊዜ እንደምታምነው የማይተኩ ናቸው ማለት አይደለም፡፡	But that doesn't mean that they are not being met as often as you think.
687	Meles was a great leader, do you support the idea of naming different institutions after his name?	ጓደኛዬ:- መለስ ታላቅ መሪ ናቸው ብለህ ካመንክ ብዙ ተቋማት በእርሳቸው ስም መሰየማቸውን ትደግፋለህ?	My friend:- If you think that a great leader is a huge leader, do you support many organizations named after him?
688	Like the renaissance dam” to be named Meles Zenawi dam” and his image to be featured on the 100 Birr bill ?	ለምሳሌ የሕዳሴው ግድብ” የመለስ ዜናዊ ግድብ” ቢባል እና ምስላቸው በመቶ ብር ኖት ላይ ቢሰፍር?	"For example, if the ""Overseas Development Pipeline"" is called ""The Ethiopian Pipeline"" and the image is on a 100 rupee coin, would you know that?"
689	ME: - There is no problem with naming things after a great leader at all.	እኔ: - ነገሮችን በታላቅ መሪ ስም መሰየም ምንም ችግር የለውም፡፡	I: - It's no problem to name things by a great leader.
690	For example, I was happy to see that Mekelle University named its new camps in Quiha as Meles Zenawi Institute of Technology” I also heard the same story from Jigjiga University.	ለምሳሌ፣ መቐለ ዩንቨርስቲ የኲሓ ካምፓሱን ‹‹የመለስ ዜናዊ የቴክኖሎጂ ኢንስቲትዩት›› ጅጅጋ ዩንቨርስቲም ውስጥ ተመሳሳይ ታሪክ ሰምቻለሁ፡፡	For example, I heard the same story in the University of Malang's Faculty of Chemistry and in the University of Gaziantep's Faculty of Technology.
691	And then, it seems many Universities, offices, towns and villages are busy naming whatever thing they have after Meles.	እናም፣ ብዙ ዩንቨርስቲዎቸ፣ ቢሮዎች፣ ከተሞችና መንደሮች ያላቸውን ነገር ሁሉ በመለስ እየተሰየሙ ነው፡፡	And, many universities, offices, cities and villages are changing their names. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
692	It sounds like they are in completion as to who wins the game” of the day well, and this could go beyond the limit.	ፉክክሩን” ማን ያሸንፋል እየተባባሉ ይመስላል እና ጉዳዩ ከዚህም በላይ ገደብ ሊያጣ ይችላል፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
693	For example, yesterday I heard that one of the oldest high schools in Tigray (which was named after one of the past Ethiopian heroes) has been changed to Meles Zenawi high school” – If this is true, it is ridiculous and disrespecting PM. Meles.	ለምሳሌ፣ ትላንትና እንደሰማሁት ከትግራይ ጥንታዊ ትምህርት ቤቶች አንዱ (በነገራችን ላይ በቀድሞ ጀግናችን ስም የተሰየመ ነበር) አሁን ‹‹መለስ ዜናዊ ከፍተኛ ሁለተኛ ደረጃ ት/ቤት›› ተብሏል፡፡	"For example, yesterday I heard that one of the oldest schools in Eritrea (which was named after our former hero) has been renamed ""Patel Zinawi Higher Secondary School"". If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know."
694	Besides, don’t we have other local heroes who should be recognized at the local level, at least?	ይህ እውነት ከሆነ፣ በጣም አስቂኝ እና ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር መለስ የሚያዋርድ ነው የሚሆነው፡፡	If this is true, it will be very funny and will annoy Prime Minister Mohammed.
695	Can’t we just give whatever we want for the new ones and keep the old ones as they are.	በዛ ላይ፣ በአካባቢ ደረጃ ሊከበሩ የሚገባቸው የአንድ አካባቢ ጀግኖች አይኖሩንም ማለት ነው?	In addition, does that mean that there are no heroes in the area that should be remembered at the local level?
696	Regarding the renaissance dam, well I believe it is appropriate to name the dam after Meles as it is believed to be one of his ambitious plans and had full energy and commitment for its accomplishment.	የሕዳሴውን ግድብ በተመለከተ፣ በመለስ ስም መሰየሙ ተገቢ ነው ብዬ አምናለሁ ምክንያቱም ግድቡ ከአስጎምጂ ዕቅዳቸው አንዱ በመሆኑና ለአፈፃፀሙም ቁርጠኝነት እና ሙሉ ኢነርጂ ነበራቸው፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
697	But then, I fear that this could be against Meles’s belief because when he decided to name the dam renaissance dam” he probably had a good reason for that.	ነገር ግን ይህም ራሱ ከመለስ እምነት ውጪ ይሆናል ብዬ እሰጋለሁ… ምክንያቱም እርሳቸው ‹‹የሕዳሴው ግድብ›› ብለው ሲሰይሙት በቂ ምክንያት ይኖራቸዋል ብዬ እገምታለሁ፡፡	"But I'm afraid that this will be beyond the confidence of Abdullah... because I think they have a good reason to call it the ""water of the rainbow"""
698	But still completely in support of the idea of Meles Zenawi Dam”.	ነገር ግን አሁንም ‹‹መለስ ዜናዊ ግድብ›› ቢባል የሚለውን ሐሳብ እደግፈዋለሁ፡፡	"But I still support the idea of a ""Palace of Peace"" being named. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know."
699	As to featuring Meles’s image on any of the Ethiopia banknotes/bills, I do not think it is a good idea.	ነገር ግን የመለስን ፎቶ በየብሩ ላይ ማተም የሚባለው ጥሩ ሐሳብ አይመስለኝም፡፡	But I don't think it's a good idea to print the picture of a former president on every newspaper.
700	The Ethiopian ruling party, EPRDF, has had to endure an endless censure for using the name and pictures of Meles Zenawi to unite the country under his vision.	የገዢው ፓርቲ ኢሕአዴግ በመለስ ዜናዊ ራዕይ የኢትዮጵያ ሕዝብን አንድ ለማድረግ በስማቸው እና በምስላቸው መጠቀሙን መቀጠል አለበት፡፡	If you can't translate, just say you don't know. The ruling party needs to continue to use their name and image to unite the people of Ethiopia.
701	However, some people feel that the party is abusing the late leader to the maximum.	ምንም እንኳን አንዳንድ የፓርቲ ሰዎች መለስን አላግባብ ፓርቲው እየተጠቀመባቸው እንደሆነ እየተሰማቸው ቢሆንም፡፡	Although some party members feel that the party is using Paul inappropriately.
702	In an open memo, Kirubel Teshome asks the widow of Meles Zenawi to stop cheap adoration of her dead husband:	በግልጽ ማስታወሻው፣ ክሩቤል ተሾመ የሟች መለስ ዜናዊ ባለቤት ስለባለቤታቸው እያወሩ ያሉትን ርካሽ የፍቅር ወሬ እንዲያቆሙ ጠይቋል:-	In a clear note, Carolyn T. asked the former wife of late President Mohammed Zine-Adei to stop gossiping about her. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
703	Open memo to W/ro Azeb Mesfin: Can you please, please, please, tell the Addis Ababa .A city administration to stop violating the wish of the late PM. You openly told Ethiopians and the world that Meles was not a kind of person that indulges individual fame or cult.	- እባክዎ፣ እባክዎ፣ እባክዎ ለአዲስ አበባ አስተዳዳሪዎች እርስዎ መለስ የግል ዝና እና ሰብእና ግንባታ አይወዱም በማለት ለኢትዮጵያ ሕዝብ በግልጽ የተናገሩትን የመለስ ምኞት መጣስ እንዲያቆሙ ይንገሯቸው፡፡	Please tell the chiefs of the capital that you don't like their personal fame and their personal character, as they explicitly said to the people of Ethiopia, that you don't like their personal fame and their personal character.
704	You revealed how he would have disliked to see all this images of him being a wall paper of the city.	ምስላቸው የከተማዋ የግድግዳ ሽፋን ሆኖ ማየት እንዴት እንደሚጠሉ ነግረውናል፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
705	I am sure, by now, you may have noticed how the city administration have been relentless in advancing against his legacy by painting the town with pictures of the late PM.	እርግጠኛ ነኝ አሁን፣ የከተማዋ አስተዳደር ያለምንም እረፍት ከተማዋን በመለስ ምስል ከመለስ ውርስ በተቃራኒ እያጥለቀለቀው መሆኑን አስተውለዋል፡፡	I'm sure now, the city administration is taking over the city without a rest, surrounding it with the image of Paul, against Paul's tradition. If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
706	I wonder why they dont wish to let him have peace at least on his death?	ቢያንስ ከሞታቸው በኋላ እንኳን እረፍት እንዲያደርጉ ለምን እንዳልፈቀዱላቸው ግራ ገብቶኛል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. I wonder why they didn't allow them to rest even after they died.
707	It is also against his legacy to see cleaner and greener Addis.	አሁንም የፀዳችና አረንጓዴ አዲስ አበባን ማየት ውርሳቸው ነበር፡፡	However, they still loved to see the sunny and green New Delhi.
708	Can you please call for the immediate collection of his images from the walls, fences and buildings of Addis?	ስለዚህ እባክዎ ባስቸኳይ ምስሎቻቸው ከከተማዋ ግድግዳዎች፣ አጥሮች እና ሕንፃዎች ላይ እንዲነሱ ያድርጉ፡፡	Please immediately remove their images from the walls, roofs and buildings of the city.
709	It would be a favor that the people of Addis will not forget!	የአዲስ አበባ ሕዝቦች መቼም የማይዘነጉት ውለታ ይሆንልዎታል!	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know The people of Hyderabad will never forget your contribution!
710	Since his death, the late prime minister has been praised for the economic growth Ethiopia has claimed to have recorded over the past two decades.	ሞታቸው ከተሰማ ጀምሮ፣ የቀድሞው ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር የኢትዮጵያ ኢኮኖሚ ላለፉት ሁለት ዐሥርት ዓመታት ላስመዘገበው የዕድገት ክብረወሰን ሲሞገሱ ከርመዋል፡፡	Since the announcement of his death, the former Prime Minister has been lauding the growth of the Ethiopian economy for two centuries. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
711	By the same token, he has also been criticized for jailing political activists and journalists, using vaguely defined terrorism offenses.	በተመሳሳይም፣ የፖለቲካ አራማጆች እና ጋዜጠኞችንም አሻሚ ትርጉም ባለው የአሸባሪነት ወንጀል በማሰራቸውም ይወቀሳሉ፡፡	In addition, politicians and journalists are also accused of being involved in a terrorist plot.

713	Besides the beauty of the Ethiopian game and the composure the players showed after a long absence from the AFCON tournament, Ethiopian politics was at the centre of online discussion.	ከኢትዮጵያውያኑ ውብ አጨዋወት እና ከረዥም ጊዜ መጥፋት በኋላ በአፍሪካ ዋንጫ ከታየው ድንቅ የተጫዋቾች ችሎታ ባሻገር፣ የኢትዮጵያ ፖለቲካ ከኳሱ ጎንለጎን ማዕከላዊ የውይይት አጀንዳ ለመሆን በቅቶ ነበር፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
714	Ethiopian fans in the stadium displayed various placards and flags representing different political interests.	በስታዲየሙ ጨዋታውን ለመመልከት የገቡት ኢትዮጵያውያን የተለያዩ ጽሑፎችን እና ባንዲራዎችን ሲያውለበልቡ ታይተዋል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

717	In a bid to create a sense of deja vu for Ethiopians the blog Addis Rumble published a few historical photos from old AFCON tournaments in which Ethiopia had participated.

718	In the pictorial post titled, The Ethiopian comeback it wrote:	‹የኢትዮጵያ መመለስ› የሚል ርዕስ በሰጡት በዚህ ጽሑፋቸው የሚከተለውን አስፍረዋል፡	"In his article titled ""The Return of Ethiopia"" he explained the following:"
719	This week Ethiopia is making a surprise comeback at the 2013 Cup of Nations in South Africa after knocking out neighboring rivals Sudan through an aggregate 5-5 draw in the final qualification round.	በዚህ ሳምንት፣ ኢትዮጵያ በድንገቴ ድል ጎረቤታችን ሱዳንን በደርሶ መልስ ጫወታ 5 ለ 5 በመርታት የመጨረሻውን ዙር አልፋ ለ2013 የአፍሪካ ዋንጫ ለመሳተፍ በቅታለች፡፡	This week, Ethiopia ended a surprise win over neighbor Sudan 5 to 5 in a tie-break to qualify for the 2013 African Cup of Nations.
720	In the days after the qualification was secured in October last year, Addis seemed like a transformed city.	ለዋንጫ ጨዋታው ማለፏ ከተረጋገጠ ወዲህ ባሉት ቀናት፣ ከጥቅምት ወር ወዲህ አዲስ አበባ የተለወጠች ከተማ መስላ ሰንብታለች፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
721	Previously you would hardly notice any football celebrations in the cityscape (other than of the usual English Premier League teams) but following the qualification most of the capital’s blue taxis and mini-buses – usually the best way of distilling public opinion – started displaying posters of the national team with a ‘Yes We Can’ text added.	ከዚህ በፊት (ከተለመደው የእንግሊዝ ፕሪሚየርሊግ ወግ በቀር) ብዙም የደመቀ የኳስ ወሬ የማይስተዋልባት ከተማ በዚሁ ወሬ ተጠምዳ ሰንብታለች… ብዙ ጊዜ የሕዝብ አስተያየት እንደሚንፀባርቅባቸው የሚታመኑት የታክሲ ውስጥ ጽሑፎች ሳይቀሩ… ‹አዎ እንችላለን› የሚል ጽሑፍ ለጥፈው ታይተዋል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know
722	The occasion was also packed with interesting Ethiopian political tidbits.	አጋጣሚው የተለየ የፖለቲካ ጣዕምም ተቋድሷል፡፡	If you can't translate the situation simply say you don't know.
723	Mohamed Ademo, a blogger based in New York wrote on Facebook about how different groups stood behind one team despite their variation on the political and cultural spectrum:	ሞሐመድ አዴሞ የተሰኘ፣ ኢትዮጵያዊ የኒውዮርክ ጦማሪ በፌስቡክ ገጹ ላይ የተለያየ የፖለቲካ አመለካከት ያላቸው ሰዎች ከነፖለቲካ ልዩነታቸው አንድ ቡድንን ለመደገፍ የቆሙበትን ሁኔታ እንደሚከተለው ገልጾታል፡	Mohammad Adeem, an Ethiopian journalist in New York, describes the situation in which different political opinions have stood up for a particular party.
724	Sport brings people together.	ስፖርት ሕዝቦችን አንድ ያደርጋቸዋል፡፡	Sports makes people united. If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
725	The cheerful Oromo crowd in South Africa today is a good example of that.	የደስተኞቹ ኦሮሞዎች ስብስብ ዛሬ በደቡብ አፍሪካ ያንን የሚያስመሰክር ነው፡፡	The Ethiopian diaspora is proving that today in South Africa.
726	In the states, rarely do we see both sides (Oromo and other Ethiopians) cheering for the same team.	በአሜሪካ ሁለቱ ወገኖች (ኦሮሞዎች እና ሌሎቹ ኢትዮጵያውያን) አንድ ቡድን ለመደገፍ የምንገናኝበት ዕድል በጣም ጠባብ ነው፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
727	We have separate sporting tournaments and federations.	የተለያዩ የስፖርት ግጥሚያዎች እና ፌዴሬሽን ነው ያለን፡፡	We have different sports and federations. If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
728	For Ethiopia's football fans in South Africa, the choice today was between OLF flag, the defacto Oromo flag, and the EPRDF (Ethiopia's ruling party) flag.	ዛሬ በደቡብ አፍሪካ ላሉ የኢትዮጵያ እግር ኳስ ደጋፊዎች ምርጫው በኦነግ ባንዲራ እና በአገልግሎት ላይ ባለው የኦሮሞ ባንዲራ መካከል ነበር፡፡	Today, for Ethiopian football fans in South Africa, the choice was between the opposition flag and the operating Ethiopian flag.
729	As you have said so eloquently, whether the Oromo and non-Oromo fans of Team Ethiopia displayed different flags didn't matter. They both supported one team.	እናንተም ቀድማችሁ በግልጽ እንዳስመሰከራችሁት፣ ኦሮሞም ሆኑ የኦሮሞ ያልሆኑ የኢትዮጵያ ቡድን ደጋፊዎች የሚያውለወልቡት ባንዲራ ልዩነት ምንም ችግር የለውም፤ ምክንያቱም ሁሉም የሚደግፉት አንድ ቡድን ነበር፡፡	You also pointed out that the difference in the flag doesn't matter, as you already pointed out, because all supporters of the Ethiopian team supported the same team.
730	For far too long, at international sporting events and bazaars, a monolithic image of Ethiopia have been presented to the world.	ለረዥም ጊዜ፣ የዓለም አቀፍ የስፖርት እንቅስቃሴዎች፣ አንዲት ኢትየጵያን ለዓለም ሲያስተዋውቅ ነበር፡፡	For a long time, international sport events have been selling an entire country to the world.
731	An Ethiopia with 3000 years of history that is still a christian island, has one flag, and speaks only Amharic.	የ3000 ዓመት ታሪክ ያላት፣ የክርስትያን ደሴት፣ አንድ ባንዲራ ያላት እና አንድ አማርኛ የምትናገር ኢትዮጵያን፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know Ethiopia has a 3000-year history, a Christian island, a flag and an alphabet.
732	But in reality, Ethiopia is a truly diverse nation with divergent aspirations and historical experiences.	እውነታው ግን፣ ኢትዮጵያ የብዝኃ-ብሔሮች አገር በተለያዩ ታሪኮች እና ባሕሎች የተገነባች መሆኗ ነው፡፡	But the truth is that Ethiopia is a multi-ethnic country with diverse history and customs.
733	As a result, contending national sentiments (isms) have emerged.	በውጤቱም፣ ብሔራዊ ስሜቶች እየጎሉ መጥተዋል፡፡	In the end, national feelings have become weaker. If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
734	Under previous Ethiopian regimes, for example, the use of Afan Oromo in public spaces and government offices was banned.	ባለፉት የኢትዮጵያ መንግሥታዊ ሥርዐቶች ለምሳሌ፣ ኦሮምኛ መናገር በሕዝባዊ ስፍራዎች እና በመንግሥት ጽ/ቤቶች ውስጥ የተፈቀደ አልነበረም፡፡	For example, in the past Ethiopian governments, it was not allowed to speak Armenian in public places and in government offices.
735	In EPRDF's Ethiopia, while linguistic and cultural rights are - at least in theory - respected, wearing or displaying an OLF flag amounts to an act of terrorism.	በኢሕአዴግ ኢትዮጵያ፣ የቋንቋና የባሕል መብቶች - ቢያንስ በኀልዮት ደረጃ ቢከበሩም የኦነግን ባንዲራ ማውለብለብና መልበስ በሽብርተኝነት ያስቀጣል፡፡	If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
736	What you saw today (the bitching and moaning about Oromo flag from those who still want to control the narrative of Ethiopia) is an extension of that false sense of unity.	ዛሬ ያያችሁት (ስለኦሮሞ ሕዝብ ያለውን ትርክት ለመቆጣጠር የሚፈልጉ ሰዎች ስድብ እና ዘለፋ) የመነጨው ከዚህ የሐሰት የአንድነት ቀኖና ነው፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. What you've seen today (the abuse and rumors of people trying to control the myth of the Oromia people) comes from this false unity doctrine.
737	I concur with you that, at the absence of national consensus, the way forward is to recognize our differences and respect people's rights to identify however they see fit.	ከናንተ ጋር የምስማማው፣ ልዩነታችንን በመቀበል እና ሕዝቦች ያመኑበትን በማክበር ወደፊት መቀጠል ስንችል ነው፡፡	I agree with you, that we can continue to move forward by accepting our differences and respecting what people believe.
738	In the same vein, our Oromo activists should also stop pouncing on every chance to question the nationalism of those who are passionate football fans - and chose to look beyond politics.	በተመሳሳይ መንገድ፣ የኦሮሞ አራማጆቻችን ከፖለቲካ አጀንዳ አፈንግጠው ኳሱን ብቻ ለመመልከት የፈለጉትን የኳስ አፍቃሪዎች ስሜት በብሔር ነክ ጥያቄዎች ማስጨነቃችሁን ማቆም ይኖርባችኋል፡፡	In the same way, our advocates for the Oromia should stop worrying the football fans who wanted to see the game alone, without politics.
739	All the while, it's imperative to stay civil and use this opportune moment to ask: who is Ethiopian, what's the Ethiopian identity, does the EPRDF flag represent the aspirations of the diverse people of Ethiopia, does waving OLF flag automatically make one a secessionist, why do Oromos love the OLF flag, why are non-Oromo Ethiopians so scared of assertive Oromo nationalism etc.	ይህም ሆኖ ሳለ፣ እንደአንድ አስተዋይ ዜጋ የሚከተሉትን ጥያቄዎች መጠየቅ ተገቢ ይሆናል፡ - ማነው ኢትዮጵያዊ፣ የኢትዮጵያዊነት መለያ ምንድን ነው፣ የኢሕአዴግ ባንዴራ የኢትዮጵያዊ ብዝኃነትን ይወክላል፣ የኦነግን ባንዲራ ማውለብለብስ ገንጣይ ያሰኛል፣ ለምን ኦሮሞዎች የኦነግን ባንዲራ ይወዱታል፣ ለምን ኦሮሞ ያልሆኑ ኢትዮጵያውያን ኦሮሞነታቸውን የሚወዱ ኦሮሞዎችን ማየት ያስደነግጣቸዋል… ወዘተ፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know

743	While #Zambia's fans waved only 1 flag, #Ethiopia's side had more than 2 flags.	የ #ዛምቢያ ደጋፊዎች አንድ ባንዲራ ብቻ ሲያውለበልቡ፣ የ#ኢትዮጵያ ደጋፊዎች ከሁለት በላይ ባንዲራዎችን አውለብልበዋል፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
744	But for Zerihun it would have been great for Eritreans if Eritrea was still a part of Ethiopia.	ፖለቲካ የተቀባ ኳስ - መፍትሔ ያልተሰጣቸው ጉዳዮች ነፀብራቅ፡፡	Political soccer - a reflection of problems that are not resolved.
745	Mentioning the alleged failed coup attempt by Eritrean rebel soldiers, he tweeted:	ለዘሪሁን ደግሞ ኤርትራ እስካሁን የኢትዮጵያ አካል ብትሆን ለኤርትራውያን ጥሩ እንደነበር በዕለቱ ተካሄደ ስለተባለው የመፈንቅለ መንግሥት ሙከራ እየጠቀሰ ይናገራል፡፡	For Zarin, Eritrea was a good thing for the Eritreans when it was a part of Ethiopia, referring to the coup attempt that took place on the same day.

753	By accessing the university's satellite connection, which was provided by the government program called Infocentros , the students are able to access the internet to share images of activities, facilities, and the stunning nature that surrounds the 2,000-hectare campus located in the state of Bolívar.	በመንግሥታዊው ኢንፎሴንትሮስ የተሰኘ ፕሮግራም በተዘጋጀው የዩንቨርሲቲውን የሳተላይት ግንኙነት በመጠቀም ተማሪዎቹ እንቅስቃሴዎቻቸውን፣ ንብረቶቻቸውን እና አስደናቂ ውበት የተላበሰውን እና በቦሊቪያ ውስጥ 2,000 ሄክታር ላይ የተንጣለለውን ካምፓሳቸውን በበይነመበረብ አጋርተዋል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know

766	Rosie Alves is a young Angolan blogger and cronista living in Luanda.	መኖሪያዋን ያደረገችው በአንጎላ ዋና ከተማ ሉዋንዳ ውስጥ ነው፡፡	She lived in the capital of Angola, Luanda.
767	The crónica is a Portuguese writing form that is very suited to blogging - originally published in newspapers, they are tales, sometimes true and sometimes fictionalized, that convey a point or a conceit in a very short form. In her blog Sweet Cliché, Alves writes short tales, often about love and intimate encounters.	cronista” ማለት በፖርቱጋል ቋንቋ መጦመር የሚለውን ቃል ተስተካካይ ትርጉም የሚሰጥ ሲሆን - ፅሁፎቹ ባብዛኛ ጊዜ በጋዜጣ የሚታተሙ ታሪኮች አንዳንዴ እውነተኛ ተሪኮች ሌላ ጊዜ ደግሞ የፈጠራ ልብ ወለዶች ሲሆኑ ብዙውን ጊዜ የራስ ችሎታን በአጭሩ ያሳያሉ፡፡	"If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know cronista. ""Cronista"" means in Portuguese to write a substitute for the word ""cronist"" - these letters are usually published in the press, sometimes true stories, sometimes fiction, often a brief summary of one's own talents."
768	(Blogspot warns readers of the adult nature of her blog). Here's an excerpt from her most popular recent post Matei o meu amor - I killed my love:	Sweet Cliché በተሰኘው ጦማሯ አልቬስ አጫጫር ታሪኮችን የምትፅፍ ሲሆን፣ በአብዛኛው ስለፍቅር እና ስለፍቅር ጥብቅ ግንኙነቶች ትፅፋለች ( Bolgspot የፅሑፎቿ እንባቢዎች እድሜቸው ለፅሑፉ የሚመጥን ስለመሆኑ ያስጠነቅቃል)፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know Sweet Cliché in her blog, Alessa writes funny stories, mostly about love and romance (Bolgspot warns readers that their age is appropriate for the article).
769	I like to write narrative crónicas - that are sometimes made up only of dialogue. They come very close to short stories.	ከዚህ በታች ሰሞኑን በጣም አነጋጋሪ የነበረው ፅሑፏ ቀርቧል፡፡	Here is the article that has been very controversial this week.
770	They are more committed to daily events, that is, banal, common events.	I killed my love” (ፍቅሬን ገደልኩት”):-	"If you can't translate simply say you don't know I killed my love"" (I killed my love):-"
771	I like to mix things up and explore new territory.	አንዱን ከአንዱ መደበላላቅ እና እዲስ ነገር መፍጠርም እወዳለሁ፡፡	I like to mix and match and create new things.
772	GV: When did you start blogging?	GV: መጦመር መቼ ነበር የጀመርሽው ?	When did you start dating?
773	Why do you write?	ለምን ትፅፊያለሽ?	Why do you write?
774	I decided to blog in 2010.	ለመጦመር የወሰንኩት በ2010 ነው፡፡	I decided to start dating in 2010.
775	Writing calms me.	መፃፍ ያረጋጋኛል፡፡	Write me alone. If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
776	Every time I write, I feel that I am taking a load off of my shoulders.	ሁሌም በፃፍኩ ቁጥር ከትከሻዬ ላይ ሽክም እንዳወረድኩ ይሰማኛል፡፡	Every time I write I feel like I'm being squeezed from my shoulder.
777	And my tongue (lol).	ከምላሴም( ሳበሳ)፡፡	If you can't translate, just say you don't know from heaven.
778	For me, it is the best therapy.	ለኔ መፃፍ ፈውስ ነው፡፡	Write is a cure for me.
779	GV: You write quite a bit about love, intimacy, and sex.	GV: ፍቅር፣ የፍቅር እና ግብረ ስጋ ግንኝነት በተመለከተ ነው የምትፅፊው፡፡	GV: You are writing about love, love and sex. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
780	How are these topics dealt with by Angolan society? Are they taboo?	እነዚህ ርዕሶች በአንጎላውያን ማህበረሰብ ዘንድ እንዴት ይታያሉ?	How do these topics look in the Angolan community?
781	Is there erotic literature in Angola?	ነውር አይደሉም?	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know isn't it a sin?
782	Angolan society is quite conservative in what relates to these themes.	በአንጎላ ልቅ ወሲብን የተመለከቱ ስነፅሁፎችስ አሉ?	Is there any literature on homosexuality in the brain?
783	(This explains why, after Spain, Angola is the country that least visits my blog.) There are many taboos in Angola.	የአንጎላ ማህበረሰብ እኔ ስለማነሳቸው ሃሳቦች የሚይዙት አቋም ወግ አጥባቂ የሚባል አይነት ነው(ከስፔን በመቀጠል አንጎላ የኔን ጦማር በጥቂቱ ከሚመለከቱ አገሮች ተርታ መመደቧ ይህንን እውነት ያረጋግጣል) በአንጎላ ብዙ ነውር ነገሮች አሉ፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The Angolan community holds a stance that is conservative (after Spain, Angola ranks among the few countries that read my blog). There are many evil things in Angola.
784	In the old days, we could say that it was a question of conservatism.	ጊዜው ጥንት ቢሆን ኖሮ የወግ አጥባቂነት ጥያቄ ነው እንል ነበር፣ ነገር ግን በማህበረሰባችን ውሰጥ በርካታ ለውጦች በሚካሄዱበት በአሁኑ ወቅት ነውር ለሚባለው ነገር ምንም ቦታ የለኝም፡፡	If it were earlier, we would have called it a cultural issue, but in the current society, there are many changes, I don't think that a negative thing is a place.
785	Now with all of the transformations ongoing in our society, I see no reason for taboos.	በአንጎላ ልቅ ወሲብን በተመለከተ የተፃፉ ስነፅሑፎችን አላውቅም(የተፃፉእና ለንባብ የበቁ) ለዚህ ሃሳብ ቅርብ የሆነ ያነበብኩት Paula Tavares ‘Ritos de Passagem’ (Rites of Passage) የተሰኛ ስራ ነው፡፡	"If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. I have not read any books on eroticism in the Netherlands (written and published) but I read Paula Tavares's book ""Ritos de Passagem"" (Rites of Passage)."
786	I don't know of any erotic literature in Angola (at least published and distributed).	ሰዎች የአንጎላ ማህበረሰብ ለእንደኔ አይነት ፅሁፎች ዝግጁ አይደልም ሲሉ በተደጋጋሚ እሰማለሁ፡፡	People often say that the Angolan community is not ready for such a writing. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
787	The closest to this that I've read was the work of the poet Paula Tavares 'Ritos de Passagem' (Rites of Passage).	እውነት ነው አንጎላዊያን ለእንደኔ አይነት ፅሑፎ ዝግጁ አይደሉም፣ ነገሮች በሚሄዱበት የአካሄድ ፍጥነት ከሆነ ደግሞ መቼም ዝግጁ አይሆኑም.	Truth is, Angolans are not prepared for such a writing, and they will never be prepared for the pace of things.
788	I am used to hearing people say that Angolan society is not prepared for this kind of topic.	GV: ወጣትሴት ሆኖ በሉዋንዳ መኖር እንዴት እንደሆነ ትነግሪናለሽ?	GV: How do you tell us how to live in Geneva as a young woman?
789	That's true, it is not.	ቀላል ሆኖ አያውቅም፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
790	And at the rate things are going, it will never be...	እዚህ ከፍ ያለ ማግለል እና ለሴት ልጅ ክብር አለመስጠት አለ፡፡	This is a high exclusion and a lack of respect for women.
791	GV: Can you tell us what it is like to be a young woman in Luanda?	በመርህ ደረጃ ነፃ የወጣን ግን ማህበረሰቡ በዘልምድ ያስቀመጠልንን ሃለፊነት እንድንፈፅም የሚጠበቅብን ነፃ ያልወጣን ሴቶች ነን፡፡ GV: ስለልጅነት ትዝታሽ አጫውቺን?	GV: Tell us about your childhood.
792	It hasn't been easy, here there is much discrimination and disrespect for women.	በአራት አመት እድሜዬ አባቴ ሚሰጠኝን የተረት መፅሐፎች ማንበብ በጣም እፈልግ ነበር፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
793	At four years old, I really wanted to read a storybook that my dad gave me, so he took me to a tutor who helped me read and write before I went to primary school.	አባቴ የቤት ውስጥ አስተማሪጋር ወስዶኝ ገና መጀመሪያ ደረጃ ትምህርት ቤት ከመግባቴ በፊት ማንበብና መፃፍ ቻልኩ፡፡ በጀርባዬ የደብተር ቦረርሳ ተሸክሜ ሁሌም አስተማሪዬ ጋር እመላለስ ነበር፣ እስካሁንም ድረስ እነዚህ የልጅነት ጣፍጭ የምንግዜም ትዝታዎቼ ናቸው፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know My father took me to a home teacher before I went to school. I always took a notebook with me and always went with my teacher, these memories are still my memories of childhood.
794	I would go there every day, with my backpack on my back.	GV: በአንጎላ ያሉ የአንቺ ዘመን ትውልዶችን እንዴት ትገልጪያቸዋለሽ?	GV: How do you define the generation of your generation in Nigeria?
795	Even up until now, they were the most beautiful moments I've lived.	የኔ ዘመነኞች በታላቅ ለውጥ ውስጥ የሚኖሩ ናቸው፡፡	My generation is living in a great change. If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
796	GV: How would you describe your generation in Angola?	የሚችል ትውልድ ነው፣ህልም እና እምቅ ችሎታ ያላቸው፡፡	It's a generation that can dream and have a wonderful talent.
797	My generation is living through great changes.	መጥፎው ነገር እምቅ ችሎታ እንዳላቸው የተረዱት ጥቂቶች ናቸው፡፡	If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
798	It is a very able generation, full of dreamers and people with a lot of potential.	በሌላ በኩል የኔ ትውልድ እርስ በእርሱ ተወዳዳሪ ነው ፡፡	In the other hand , my generation is competing . If you can't translate it simply say you don't know .
799	Too bad few really know their own .	ግን በዙሪያችን ያሉ ስዎች በአንድ አላማ ስር ሲሰባሰቡ አናይም፡፡	But we don't see people gathered under one goal.
800	On the other hand, we're very competitive, we cannot see those around us and come together for the same cause.	ጥቂቶች ብቻ ናቸው ‘ህብረት’ እና ‘በአንድ አላማ መትጋት’ የሚሉትን ቃላት ፍቺ የሚያውቁ፡፡	Only few people know the meaning of the words 'unity' and 'work for one goal'.
801	Few know the meaning of the words union and solidarity.	ለመረጃ ቅርቦች ሆነን ሳለ ድርጊቶቻችን ግን በድንጋይ ዘመን እንደሚኖር ነው፡፡	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
802	We have more access to information, and even so we act as though we live in the stone age.	በአንጎላ የተለመደ አባባል አለ ወጣት ሆኖ በጭፈራ ቤት የማይጨፍር ወጣት አይደለም” የሚል፡፡	"If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know in Angola a common saying is that ""a young man who doesn't dance in a party is not a young man."""
803	In Angola, there's the phrase a young person who does not party is not a young person. Youth today only wants to party. Without generalizing, because of course there are exceptions.	ወጣቶች ዛሬ ዛሬ መጨፈር ብቻ ነው የሚሹት ፣እርግጥ ነው ሁሉንም ወጣቶች በደፈናው በአንድ ማጠቃለሌ አይደለም፡፡	If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
804	GV: Do you fit into a larger blogging scene in Angola?	GV: በአንጎላ ባሉ የጦማሪያን ምድብ ስር ራስሽን ትመድቢያለሽ?	GV: Do you choose to be a blogger in Nigeria?
805	I think so.	የበይነመረብ ጓደኞች አሉኝ፡፡	I have friends on the internet.
806	I have online peers, the Angolan blogosphere grows by the day.	ገፁን እርስ በእርሳችን ለመደጋገፍ እንዲሁም ስራዎቻችንን ለበለጠ አንባቢያን ለማዳረስ እንጠቀምበታለን፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. We will use the page to foster cooperation and to promote our work to more readers.
807	It is where we converse, trade ideas, and experiences.	ሃሳቦችን ልምዶችን የምንገበያይበት አይነተኛ መንገድ ነው፡፡	It's a great way to sell ideas and experiences.
808	And not just there, I have peers in other countries around the world.	ከአንጎላ ብቻም ሳይሆን ተጨማሪ በተለያዩ አገሮች በመላው አለም በይነ መረብ ጓደኞችአሉኝ፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
809	What should I call him?- Call him love.	- አስተናጋጅ እባክህን ቢራ? - ምንን የለንም፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
810	GV: Tell us about your writing process.	GV: ስለአፃፃፍ ሂደትሽ ንገሪን?	GV: Tell me about your writing process.
811	What are your greatest challenges?	ስትፅፊ የሚያጋጥምሽ ችግሮችም ምንድን ናቸው?	What are the problems you may have when writing?
812	Generally, I pick up my mobile and I begin to write and in less than two hours, I finish. Sometimes I spend two weeks developing a text, and it even really frustrates me.	በአጠቃላይ የሞባይል ስልኬን አውጥቼ መፃፍ እጀምራለሁ፣ ከሁለት ስዓት በሚያንስ ጊዜ ውስጥ እጨርሳለሁ፡፡	I usually start writing on my mobile phone, in less than two hours.
813	One of my great challenges, if not the only, is to make the reader find himself/herself in what I write, and I can say that I have achieved that based on the feedback I receive.	አንዳንድ ጊዜ ደግሞ እንድ ፅሑፍ ለማቀናበር ሁለት ሳምንት የፈጅብኛል፣ ያኔ ትክት ነው የሚያደርገኝ፡፡ ብቸኛው ባይሆንም አንዱና ዋንኛው ችግሬ አንባቢዎቼ በፁሑፌ ውስጥ ራሳቸውን እንዲያገኙ ማድረጉ ላይ ነው፡፡	Some times it takes me two weeks to write a single article, that makes me sick. One of the biggest problems is that I can't get my readers to find themselves in my writing.
814	GV: Who are your readers, do you know?	GV: አንባቢዎችሽ ማን ማን እንደሆኑ ታውቂያለሽ?	G: Do you know your readers?
815	How do people react to what you write?	ስለፅሑፎችስ ሰዎች ምን ይላሉ?	What do people say about books?
816	I can say that many people read it.	ብዙ ሰዎች ፅሑፌን ያነባሉ ማለት እችላለሁ፡፡	Many people can read my text. If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
817	With that I mean: all ages groups, in the most diverse group of countries.	ይህንንም ስል በተለያዩ የአለማችን ክፍሎች በተለያዩ የእድሜ ክልል ውስጥ ያሉ ስዎችን ማለቴ ነው፡፡	This also means that people in different parts of the world in different ages are being called.
818	It is strange, but according to the statistics, the country that most visits my blog is the US.	እንግዳ ነገር ነው በአለማችን ከሚገኙ ሰዎች በስታትስቲክሱ መሰረት በርካታ አንባቢዎቼ የሚገኙት በአሜሪካን ነው፡፡	It's a surprise that most of the people in the world are in America. Statistics show that most of my readers are in America.
819	There are those who have told me they read via Google Translator.	በጉግል ትርጉም አማካኝነት በመጠቀም ፅሁፌን እንዳነበቡ የገለፁልኝም አሉ፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
820	The majority congratulates me, gives me suggestions, and encourages me to carry on.	አብዛኞቹ አንባቢዎቼ በርትቼ እንድቀጥልና እንድጠነክር ማበረታቻ ሃሳብ ይሰጡኛል፡፡	Most of my readers give me encouragement to continue and to grow.
821	Obviously there are always those who do not like it or take it the wrong way, I've even been challenged by someone telling me that I should take care with what I write.	በሌላ በኩል በፍፁም ፅሑፌን የማይወዱና በተሳሳተ መንገድ የሚተረጉሙትም አሉ፡፡ ስለምፅፈው ፅሑፋ ጥንቃቄ እንድወስድ ማስጠንቀቂያ የሰጠኝ አንባቢም አለ፡፡	In the other hand, some people don't like my writing and translate it incorrectly. A reader also warned me to take care of my writing.
822	GV: What are your aspirations for the future?	GV: የወደፊት ትልሞችሽ ምን ምን ናቸው?	GV: What are your future goals?
823	I am a person full of dreams, and if I start to recount all of my aspirations here, I will not even finish today.	ወደፊት ብዙ ህልሞች ያሉኝ ሰው ነኝ፡፡	I have many dreams in the future.
824	But one of them, and really special, is to become a cronista in a newspaper or a magazine.	ለወደፊት ማድረግ የምፈልጋቸው ትልሞቼን መዘርዘር ከጀመርኩ ዛሬ የምጨርስ አይመስለኝም ነገር ግን በጋዜጣ አሊያም በመፅሔት አምደኛ ሆኖ መፃፍ አንዱ ነው፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
825	It would be fantastic.	አሪፍ ይሆናል፡፡	It will be very nice.
826	A public service announcement promoting condom use to combat the spread of HIV and other diseases in Kenya was recently pulled from the airwaves after the TV spot caused an uproar among the country's religious leaders.	በቅርቡ ለህዝብ አገልግሎት ይውል ዘንድ HIV እና ተዛማጅ በሽታዎችን ለመከላከል የተላለፈ የኮንዶም ማስታወቂያ የተለያዩ የሃይማኖት ተቋማትን ማስቆጣቱን ተከትሎ በመገናኛ ብዙሃን እንዳይተላለፍ ታገዷል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know
827	The advert, which shows a woman advising her married friend to use a condoms while engaging in an extramarital affair, was sponsored by Kenya's health ministry and foreign assistance agencies USAid and UKAid.	የኬኒያ የጤና ጥበቃ ሚኒስቴር ፒተር ቼሩቲች ለBBC ዜና አገልግሎት እንደገለፁት ማስታወቂያው የተሠራው ከባለ ትዳሮች መካከል 30 በመቶዎቹ ከትዳር ውጪ ሌሎች ተጨማሪ ግንኙነቶች ስላላቸው ነው ብለዋል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

873	Perhaps understandably, considering the higher profile crises on its doorstep, the West has treated Djibouti as little more than a tool in its arsenal – as a military base, launch pad for drone strikes, or venue for regional diplomacy – rather than a situation worth addressing in its own right.	ምናልባትም በሚያግባባ መልኩ ጅቡቲ የራሷን የውስጥ ችግር ከመፍታቷ ይልቅ የምዕራቡ ዓለም ጥቅም ማስጠበቂያ መሳሪያ እና የአካባቢው ወታደራዊ ማዕከልነትና ዲፕሎማሲያዊ ጥቅም ማስጠበቂያ ብቻ ናት፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

893	More than three years ago, Iranian authorities attempted to use the same method of humiliation against a student activist, but failed.	ከሦስት ዓመታት በፊት የኢራን ባለሥልጣናት በተማሪ አራማጆች ላይ ተመሳሳይ የማዋረድ ሥራ ሊሠሩ ሞክረው ነበር፤ አልተሳካላቸውም እንጂ፡፡	If you can't translate, just say you don't know. Three years ago Iran's authorities tried to do the same thing to students, but they didn't succeed.
894	Back then, Iranian authorities claimed that Majid Tavakoli dressed as a woman to escape after delivering a speech in Tehran on Student Day.	ያን ጊዜ የኢራን ባለሥልጣናት የጠየቁት ማጅድ ሳቫሊን ቴህራን ላይ ንግግር ካደረገ በኋላ በተማሪዎች ቀን እንደሴት እንዲለብስ ነበር፡፡	When Iran's officials asked Mahmoud Saeed to dress as a woman after speaking in Tehran, they said they don't know.
895	However, human rights activists in Iran published a report from an eyewitness saying: All the pictures published by the state media are false and a clear use of immoral means against student and civil activists in Iran.”	‹‹በመንግሥት መገናኛ ብዙኃን የሚወጡ ማንኛውም ፎቶግራፎች ውሸት እና በተማሪዎች እና በኢራን የሚሠሩ በማኅበረሰብ አራማጆች ላይ የሚወጡ የተዛቡ የሞራል እሴት የሌላቸው ናቸው›› ብሏል፡፡	"If you can't translate, just say you don't know ""All photographs published by the government media are false and those published on students and activists in Iran are offensive and offensive."
896	At the time, hundreds of Iranian men photographed themselves dressed as women in hijab to support Tavakoli.	በጊዜው በመቶ የሚቆጠሩ ኢራናውያን ወንዶች ቀሚስ ለብሰው ራሳቸውን ፎቶግራፍ በማንሳት ታቫኮሊን በመደገፍ ከጎኑ ቆመዋል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
897	Today, October 26, was the day Saudi activists chose to protest against the driving ban on women in the Kingdom.	ዛሬ፣ ጥቅምት 16፣ 2006 ለሳኡዲ አራማጆች በኪንግደሙ ሴቶች መኪና እንዳይነዱ የተጣለባቸው ማዕቀብ ላይ ለማመጽ የመረጡት ቀን ነበር።	Today, October 16, 2006, was the day when Saudi activists chose to protest against the ban on women driving in the UK.
898	As social networks were buzzing under increasing number of reports of women driving across the country, a brilliant a capella remake of Bob Marley's No Woman, No Cry spread at the speed of light, in a sound support of brave women challenging conservative sexist legislation and pseudo-scientific justification of them being prohibited to enjoy freedom of movement:	የማኅበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚዎች በአገሪቷ ውስጥ መኪና እየነዱ ስለታዩት ሴቶች ቁጥር መጨመር በስፋት እያወሩ ሳሉ፣ ተወዳጁ፣ የቦብ ማርሌይ ኖ ዉማን፣ ኖ ክራይ የተሰኘ ዜማ ሴቶችን በነጻነት የመንቀሳቀስ መብታቸውን ለመንፈግ የወጣ የወግ አጥባቂ ስርዓተ ፆታ ሕግን እና ሐሰተኛ የሳይንሳዊ ማብራሪያውን በሞገቱ ቆራጥ ሴቶች ድምፅ ድጋፍ ተቀይሮ በብርሃን ፍጥነት ሲሰራጭ ነበር፤	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

929	Internet penetration in Ghana is about 14 percent and has been on the up and up for the last decade as more Ghanaians, especially young people, have hooked up to the web.	በጋና፣ የበይነመረብ ተዳራሽነት መጠን 14 በመቶ ገደማ ነው፤ በተጨማሪም ባለፉት ዐሥር ዓመታት በተለይም ወጣት ጋናውያን ከመረጃ መረብ ጋር መተዋወቃቸውን ተከትሎ እያደገ፣ እያደገ መጥቷል፡፡	In Ghana, the Internet is accessible to 14 percent of the population, and has grown exponentially over the past ten years, particularly among young Ghanaians who have been acquainted with the Internet.
930	As a result, the number of Ghanaians on various social media platforms is also increasing rapidly, and some now see a need for a physical social media hub to facilitate the activities of the many people who use social media or want to learn about it.	በዚህም፣ ማኅበራዊ አውታር የሚጠቀሙ ሰዎች ቁጥር እየጨመረ በመምጣቱ አንዳንዶች የማኅበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚዎችና ስለምንነቱ መማር ለሚፈልጉትም ጭምር መሰባሰቢያ ስፍራ እንደሚያስፈልግ ታይቷቸዋል፡፡	This is because the number of people who use social media has increased. Some people have noticed that a meeting place is needed for social media users and those who want to learn about it.
931	Enter Blogging Ghana, the country's largest organization of bloggers and social media enthusiasts with more than 100 members.	ጋናን ጡመራ (Blogging Ghana)ን ይመልከቱ፣ 100 አባላት ያክል ያሉት የአገሪቱ ጦማሪዎችና ማኅበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚዎች ትልቅ ስብስብ ነው፡፡	Look at Ghana's Blog, a large group of bloggers and social media users with 100 members.
932	The group launched a campaign on January 20, 2014 to establish Ghana's first ever social media hub, explaining on their website:	ቡድኑ ጥር 12/2006 የጋናን የመጀመሪያውን የማኅበራዊ አውታር መሰባሰቢያ ቋት ለመመሥረት የሚያስችለውን ዘመቻ ድረገጹ ላይ በተደረገ ማብራሪያ ጀምሯል፡	The team began its campaign on January 12, 2006 by explaining the campaign on the site. If you cannot translate it simply say you don't know.
933	A physical meeting place, a hub, will go a long way to provide a platform for the experienced bloggers in the organisation to train students and professionals on how to use blogging for creating #MoreStories and use social media to advance their agenda as citizens in Ghana.	በአካል መገናኛ ስፍራ፣ ቋት፣ ስብስቡ ውስጥ ያሉ ብዙ ልምድ ያላቸው ጦማሪዎች ተማሪዎችን እና ባለሙያዎችን ጡመራን ብዙ ትረካዎችን (#morestories) ለመፍጠር እንዴት መጠቀም እንደሚችሉ እና ማኅበራዊ አውታሮችን በመጠቀም እንደ ጋና ዜግነታቸው ተሳትፏቸውን ማበርከት እንዲችሉ ያስተምሯቸዋል፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
934	Africa on the Blog, a multi-author blog by people of African heritage, which is supported by Babs Saul and Sarah Arrow, explained the history of blogging in Ghana:	አፍሪካ በጦማር የተሰኘ ብዙ ደራሲዎችን የአቀፈ በባብስ ሳዉል እና ሳራ አሮው የሚደገፍ የአፍሪካ ቅርስ ሰዎች የጡመራን ታሪክ በጋና አብራርተዋል፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
935	The blogging and social media scene in Ghana has improved in the last five years.	ጡመራ እና ማኅበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚነት ባለፉት አምስት ዓመታት በጋና ዕድገት አሳይቷል፡፡	The use of internet and social media has shown a growth in Ghana in the past five years.
936	The West African country has seen the number of bloggers in the country grow from just a handful in 2005 to several hundreds this year.	በ2005 ከነበሯት በጣት የሚቆጠሩ ጦማሪዎች ዛሬ ላይ በርካታ መቶዎች የሚሆኑ ጦማሪዎችን ለማየት በቅታለች፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
937	This trend was facilitated by a bold step taken by a Swedish blogger who had moved to Ghana some five years ago.	ይህ ዕድገት አንድ ወደጋና የዛሬ አምስት ዓመት ገደማ የመጣ ስዊድናዊ በወሰደው ትልቅ ርምጃ ሊሳካ ችሏል፡፡	This development was achieved by a Swedish man who came to Geneva five years ago.
938	Kajsa Hallberg Adu who is now the Chair of Ghana’s biggest association of bloggers brought all the bloggers who were active online under one roof to discuss their passion.	ካጅሳ ሆልበርግ አዱ፣ በአሁኑ ሰዓት የጋና ትልቁ የጦማሪዎች ማኅበር ሊቀመንበር ሲሆን በወቅቱ በይነመረብ ላይ በንቃት ይሳተፉ የነበሩትን ጦማሪዎች ሰብስቦ በአንድ ጣሪያ ስር ስለሥራዎቻቸው እንዲወያዩ አስችሏቸዋል፡፡	Currently the largest journalists' organization in Ghana, Captain Joel Bure, is the president of the largest journalists' organization in Ghana. He gathered the bloggers who were actively participating in the internet during the time he was a journalist.
939	With time, this small group of internet users decided to introduce blogging and the use of social media tools to many other people who may be interested but just didn’t know how.	በጊዜ ሒደት፣ ይህ ትንሽ ቡድን ጡመራንና ማኅበራዊ አውታርን ባለማወቅ ዝም ያሉ ነገር ግን ቢያውቁ ኖሮ እነሱ እንደሚጠቀሙበት ሊጠቀሙበት የሚችሉ ሰዎችን ከማኅበራዊ አውታሮች ጋር ለማስተዋወቅ ወሰነ፡፡	In the course of time, this small group decided to introduce people to social media that they didn't know, but would have used it if they knew.
940	This selfish desire to spread such knowledge lead to what has today become the nation’s biggest blogging and social media event.	ይህ ዕውቀትን የማሰራጨት የግል ፍላጎት ዛሬ አገሪቱ በጡመራ እና ማኅበራዊ አውታር አጠቃቀም ለደረሰችበት ደረጃ አድርሷታል፡፡	This individual desire to share knowledge has led to the reach of the country today in the use of forums and social media.
941	Edward Amartey-Tagoe, the director of corporate services at Blogging Ghana, also recounted how things were half a decade ago:	ኤድዋርድ አማርቴ-ታጎ፣ በጋናን ጡመራ ውስጥ የኮርፖሬት አገልግሎቶች ዳይሬክተር - የዛሬ አምስት ዓመት ነገሮች እንዴት እንደነበሩ አስታውሰዋል፡	Eduardo Amarte-Tago, the director of company services at the Geneva Summit, remembers how things were five years ago.
942	Some five years ago, there were only a handful of bloggers in Ghana, since then, bloggers and Internet enthusiasts have been organised under one umbrella body to build capacity, learn and share ideas from one another.	የዛሬ አምስት ዓመት ገደማ በጣት የሚቆጠሩ ጦማሪዎች ብቻ ነበሩ፤ ከዚያ ወዲህ ግን ጦማሪዎች እና የኢንተርኔት ወዳጆች በአንድ ጥላ ሥር ተደራጅተው አቅማቸውን ለመገንባት እና አንዱ ከሌላው ለመማርና ሐሳቦችን ለመለዋወጥ ችለዋል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know Before five years, there were only a handful of bloggers; since then, bloggers and Internet friends have formed a network and developed their skills and learned from each other and exchanged ideas.
943	Today, we are an influential organisation with a yearly event and awards ceremony who produce local content online on blogs and on various social media channels.	ዛሬ፣ ተፅዕኖ ፈጣሪ ስብስብ ከመሆናችንም ባሻገር በየዓመቱ ጥሩ አገራዊ ይዘት ያላቸውን ጦማሮች የሚጽፉትን የምንሸልምበት ደረጃ ላይ ደርሰናል፡፡	Today, we are a diverse group of influence, but we also reach a level where we can judge those who write good publications each year.
944	We want to share our skills and create #morestories!	ክኅሎታችንን በማጋራት ብዙ ትረካዎች እንዲፈጠሩ እንፈልጋለን፡፡	We want to create a lot of jokes by sharing our skills.
945	ENews Ghana published the campaign on their website:	ኢኒውስ ጋና ስለዘመቻው በድረገጻቸው ላይ የሚከተለውን ጻፉ፡	The Independent published the following on its website:
946	Bloggers in Ghana are creating Ghana’s first Social Media hub for bloggers and social media enthusiasts to meet, interact and share more local content from and we think it will make a great feature on GOOD.	የጋና ጦማሪዎች እና የማኅበራዊ አውታር ወዳጆች የሚገናኙበት የመጀመሪያውን ቋት በመመሥረት ሊገናኙ እና ሐሳቦቻቸውን ሊለዋወጡ ነው፤ ይህ ለዘለቄታዊ መልካም ዕድል ነው ብለን እናምናለን፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
947	Social Media is growing in Ghana and we (Blogging Ghana) has over the past 5 years been a leader in Ghana.	የማኅበራዊ አውታር በጋና እያደገ ነው፡፡ እና እኛ (ጋናን ጡመራ) ላለፉት አምስት ዓመታት በጋና የጡመራ መሪዎች ሆነናል፡፡	Social media is growing in Ghana. And we (Ganai Scouts) have been the leader of the Scouts in Ghana for five years.
948	In 2012, with funding from USAID, UKAID, EU & DANIDA, we used social media to cover Ghana’s elections; raising awareness of the issues and empowering politicians and citizens.	ከUSAID፣ UKAID፣ EU እና DANIDA በተገኘ የገንዘብ ድጋፍ ማኅበራዊ አውታርን የጋናን ምርጫ ሽፋን ለመስጠት ተጠቅመንበታል፤ በተለያዩ ጉዳዮች ላይ ግንዛቤዎችን በማስጨበጥ እና ፖለቲከኞችን እና ዜጎችን በማጎልበትም ጭምር፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
949	We also in 2013 organised Ghana’s first social media awards which was huge success.	አ. 2013 የጋናን የመጀመሪያውን የጋናን የጦማሪዎች ሽልማትንም በማዘጋጀት ትልቅ ስኬት ተቀናጅተናል፡፡	In 2013, we also shared a big success in arranging the first Geneva Writers' Prize. If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
950	We want to do more and get more Ghanaians to use social media to tell their stories.	ብዙ መሥራት እና ብዙ ጋናውያን ወደማኅበራዊ አውታር በመውጣት ታሪካቸውን እንዲናገሩ እንፈልጋለን፡፡	We want to work hard and to get many Ghanaians to tell their stories on social media.
951	We want to overcome the internet and power challenges bloggers face.	ጦማሪዎች የሚገጥሟቸውን የበይነመረብ እና የኃይል ችግር መቅረፍ እንፈልጋለን፡፡	We want to solve the problems of the soldiers with Internet and power.
952	We have therefore launched a crowdfunding campaign to create a haven/hub with a co-blogging space to and create the much needed local content.	ለዚህም ከዜጎች ገንዘብ በመሰብሰብ የመገናኛ ስፍራ መመሥረት ለጋራ ጡመራ እና የአገር ውስጥ መረጃዎችን ለመጻፍ የሚያስችለንን ዘመቻ ጀምረናል፡፡	For this, we have begun a campaign to raise money from the public to create a media center that can coordinate a joint search and publish local information.
953	It makes sense for a social media organization to use our online network and do crowd-sourcing to fulfill our dreams.	የጋራ ጽሑፎችን በመጻፍ ሕልሞቻችንን እውን ለማድረግ ማኅበራዊ አውታር ተጠቃሚዎች መደራጀት ሲሆን ትርጉም ይሰጣል፡፡	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

Conversational languages are natural languages; the speaker is very closely related to the speaker because they learn natural laws in the area and form a person's personality.

993	At the end of the 20th century, this trend was reversed.	በ20ኛው ክፍለዘመን መገባደጃ፣ ይህ ሒደት ተቀለበሰ፡፡	In the end of the 20th century, this process was completed.
994	While Ainu’s future is still not guaranteed because it isn’t taught in schools, the resurgence of interest is undeniable.	ምንም እንኳን የኤኑ ቋንቋ ቀጣይነት ዋስትና ባይኖረውም መነቃቃቱ ግን የማይካድ ነው፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

999	Is your mother tongue facing extinction?	የአፍ መፍቻ ቋንቋችሁ እየጠፋ ነው?	Is your native language going to disappear?

1003	A lot of people speaking English natively forget the importance of mother language due to its predominance. 	በእንግሊዝኛ ቋንቋ አፋቸውን የሚፈቱ ሰዎች በቋንቋው የበላይነት ምክንያት የአፍ መፍቻ ቋንቋን ዋጋ ይዘነጉታል፡፡	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1004	They take their language for granted.	ቋንቋቸውን እንደመተማመኛ ይይዙታል፡፡	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
1005	However, each year a bunch of languages become extinct, the latest being Eyak, which got extinct exactly a month ago with the death of Marie Smith Jones the last native Eyak speaking person.	ሆኖም በየዓመቱ ብዙ ቋንቋዎች ይጠፋሉ፤ የቅርብ ጊዜው የዛሬ አንድ ወር ገደማ የመጨረሻ ተወላጅ ተናጋሪው በነበረችው ማሪ ስሚዝ ጆንስ ሞት ምክንያት የጠፋው እያክ ነው፡፡	But every year many languages are lost; the most recent is the Dutch, which has been lost since the death of Mary Smith Jones, the last speaker of the language.
1006	I believe that if we don't actively try to preserve our mother language they will slowly become extinct.	እንደሚመስለኝ ሁላችንም የአፍ መፍቻ ቋንቋችንን ለማኖር ካልጣልን ቀስበቀስ ይጠፋሉ፡፡	I think we all have to stop keeping our native language. If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1007	One of the most important things to preserve a language is to ensure that they are better covered by technology.”	ቋንቋዎች እንዳይጠፉ አንደኛው በጣም ጠቃሚ መንገድ ቋንቋዎች ከቴክኖሎጂጋ እንዲዋሃዱ ማድረግ ነው፡፡ ”	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

1009	Citizen media is a great tool to promote own languages.	የዜጎች ብዙኃን መገናኛ ቋንቋዎችን ለማሳደግ በጣም ጠቃሚ ነው፡፡	It is very useful to promote the development of citizens' media languages. If you cannot translate it simply say you don't know.
1010	According to Technorati there are more than 100 million blogs out there.	እንደ ቴክኖራቲ ከ100 ሚሊዮን በላይ ጦማሮች አሉ፡፡	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1011	A previous year’s report show that about 37% blogs are in Japanese followed by English (36%), Chinese (8%), Spanish(3%), Italian (3%), Portuguese (2%), French(2%) among others.	አንድ ያለፈው ዓመት ሪፖርት እንደሚያሳየው 37 በመቶ የሚሆኑት ብሎጎች በጃፓኒኛ፣ ቀጥሎ በእንግሊዝኛ (36 በመቶ)፣ ቻይንኛ (8 በመቶ)፣ ስፓኒሽ (3 በመቶ)፣ ጣሊያንኛ (3 በመቶ)፣ ፖርቹጊዝ (2 በመቶ)፣ ፈረንሳይኛ (2 በመቶ) እና ሌሎችም ናቸው፡፡	One recent report showed that 37 percent of the newspapers were in Japanese, followed by English (36 percent), Chinese (8 percent), Spanish (3 percent), Italian (3 percent), Portuguese (2 percent), French (2 percent) and others.
1012	And there are other growing language communities and they will rise eventually.	እናም፣ ሌሎችም ቋንቋዎች ያሉ ሲሆን እነርሱም እያደጉ ይሄዳሉ፡፡	And there are other languages, which are growing.
1013	There are ICT based advocacy sites like Bisharat which promotes research, advocacy, and networking relating to use of African languages in software and web content.	እንደ ቢሻራት ያሉ የቴክኖሎጂ የለውጥ ማማጫዎች አሉ፡፡ የአፍሪካ ቋንቋ ሶፍትዌሮችን እና የመረብ ግንኙነቶችን ለማጠናከር ይሠራሉሉ፡ ግሎባል ቮይስስ (የዓለም ድምፆች) በይነመረብ ላይ የተለያዩ ቋንቋዎችን ያበረታታል፡፡	There are technology changes advocates like Bishar. They work to strengthen African language software and Internet connections. Global Voices (World Voices) encourages different languages on the Internet.
1014	Global Voices Online also supports and promotes the diversity of languages.	የቋንቋ ፕሮጀክቱ ዋናውን የእንግሊዝኛ ገጽ ወደተለያዩ ቋንቋዎች የማስተርጎም ሥራ ይሠራል፡፡	The language project works on translating the main English page into different languages. If you cannot translate the main English page simply say you don't know.
1015	Now that is one example many international online media may want to follow to secure meaningful transfer of information to global readers.	አሁን ይህንን ምሳሌ ሊሆን የሚችል የበይነመረብ መገናኛ ብዙኃን መረጃን ለተለያዩ አገር ሰዎች ለማዳረስ የሚደረገውን ጥረት ሌሎችም ሊከተሉት ይችላሉ፡፡	This can be an example of the effort by Internet media to reach people in different countries. If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
