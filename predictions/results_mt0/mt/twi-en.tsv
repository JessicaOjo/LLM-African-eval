100	The court in a ruling on Wednesday, June 8, refused to grant the government of Ghana an extension to apply to set aside the award – adding that the state’s grounds for challenging it were “intrinsically weak”.	Kɔɔto no atemmuo ɔde too dwa Wukuada, Kɔtɔnima da a ɛtɔ so nwɔtwe no hyɛɛ Ghana aban no sɛ ɔntua sika no ɛsiane sɛ nsɛm a wɔgyina so no mu yɛ mmerɛ.	The committee published its report on Thursday, October 7, ordered the Ghana government to pay the money because of the delay in the investigation.
101	The government through its lawyer Godfred Dame had attempted to hide behind the 2020 general election and the COVID-19 pandemic as excuses for the delay, but their excuses were dismissed by the London court.	Aban no lɔya, Godfred Dame kyerɛ sɛ 2020 abatoɔ no ne COVID-19 na ɛmaa wɔtwentwɛn wɔn nna ase nso London kɔɔto no bɔɔ ne nsɛm yi guiɛ.	The governor of the city, Godfred Dame, says the coronavirus pandemic has caused the closure of the city's schools and the London council has rejected the claim.
102	GPGC was represented before the court by Charles Kimmins QC and Mark Tushingham, where Ghana was said to have been too late to challenge the decision against it.	Charles Kimmins Qɔ ne Mark Tushingham a wɔyɛ lɔya ma GPGɔ wɔ kɔɔto nsɛm yi mu kyerɛ sɛ Ghana aban no kyeree ansa na wɔrekɔ saa asɛm yi ho dwanetoa.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know Charles Kimmins Qɔ and Mark Tushingham who were lawyers for the GPG in the constitutional cases say that the Ghana government arrested them before they went to the constitutional committee.
103	Ghana had used Khawar Qureshi QC of Serle Court and Volterra Fietta, having initially retained Omnia Strategy. In the arbitration, GPGC, used Three Crowns and Ghanaian firm, Kimathi & Partners, along with damages experts from FTI Consulting.	Ghana aban no de Khawar Qureshi Qɔ a ɛwɔ Serle kɔɔto ne Volteraa Fietta dii dwuma aberɛ wɔde Omnia Strategy nso kaa ho.

If you can't translate simply say you don't know Ghana's government used Khawar Qureshi Qɔ a ɛwɔ Serle kɔɔto ne Volteraa Fietta to coordinate the scheme. In addition, the GPG used Three Rowns and Ghana's Kimathi & Partners and FTI consulting.
104	Ghana also had representation from the attorney general’s office and Amofa & Partners in Accra.	Ghana de nnipa a wɔfiri aban lɔya panin akakye ne Amofa & Partners a ɛwɔ Nkran no kɔeɛ.	Ghana sent representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Amofa & Partners in Ghana.
105	The three-member arbitration tribunal chaired by John Beechey, a former President of the International Criminal Court’s Court of Arbitration, and co-chaired by Prof Albert Fiadjoe, a Ghanaian academic, sided with the power producer and awarded almost US$170 million, including interest.	Nnipa baasa a na wɔredi asɛm yi a na wɔn titenafoɔ ne John Beeɔhey, ɔkandifoɔ a na ɔda International ɔriminal Court of Arbitration ano, ne Prof Albert Fiadɛoe a ɔyɛ Ghanani a ɔyɛ ɔbenfoɔ maa kwan sɛ Ghana aban no ntua $170,000,000 a nsiho ka ho.	If you cannot translate this simply say you don't know. The three parties to the case were John Beehey, a lawyer who was a member of the International Criminal Court of Arbitration, and Prof Albert Fiaddeoe, a Ghanaian lawyer who sought to secure a settlement of $1.7 billion.
106	Out of the total, U$134.35 million represents the early termination payment claim, which itself is made up of US $69.36 million as an early termination fee, US$58.49 million for mobilisation costs, US$6.46 million as demobilisation cost and US$32,448 as preservation and maintenance cost.

107	The tribunal also awarded US$614,353.86 against the country as the cost of the tribunal, and costs of US$3 million against Ghana, being the legal fees expended by the GPGC during the arbitration.	Kɔɔto no san nso bɔɔ Ghana aban no ka dɔla no 614,353.86 sɛ ɛyɛ asennie no ka ɛnna dɔla no ɔpepem mmiɛnsa sɛ ɛyɛ ka GPGɔ bɔɔ no wɔn alɔyafoɔ ne asennie no ka.	The court also awarded Ghana the amount of 614,353.86 dollars as a judicial contribution and a further 500,000 dollars as a contribution to the GPG's executive and judicial departments.
108	Major highlights of the tribunal’s decision included the fact that the Ahenkora Committee which recommended the termination of the contract did not have sufficient ground in coming to the conclusion that the GPGC was entitled to only $US18 million in early termination fees.	Nsɛntitire a kɔɔto no de too dwa ne sɛ, Ahenkora Kɔmihyin a wɔkyerɛɛ sɛ wɔntwa kɔntraagye no mu no annya nnyinasoɔ papa biara a wɔde too dwa sɛ, sɛ wɔtwa kɔntraagye no mu a, ɛwɔ sɛ wɔtua $18,000,000 pɛ na ɛma GPGɔ.	The judge reported that the committee which voted not to withdraw from the agreement had no evidence to support the claim that, if they withdraw from the agreement, they would have to pay $18,000,000 to the GPG.
109	The tribunal, in dismissing Ghana’s case, delved into the basis for terminating the contract, stating that the evidence before it indicated that “GPGC did have a building permit for the Blue Ocean Site issued by the Kpone-Katamanso District Assembly on August 15, 2017.”	Kɔɔto no rebɔ Ghana aban no asɛm no aguo no, wɔdɔɔ asukɔ kɔɔ kɔntraagye a wɔtwaa mu no kyerɛɛ sɛ nnyinasoɔ a wɔgyinaa so de twaa kɔntraagye no mu no kyerɛɛ sɛ GPGɔ wɔ tumi nkrataa a Kpone-Katamanso mansini asɛmbele no dee maa wɔn fa Blue Oɔean asase no wɔ ɔsanaa da a ɛtɔ so du-num wɔ afe 2017 mu.

110	“GoG [The government] has not been able to adduce any statute or regulation, including the Energy Commission Act, which addresses the requirement for any such additional construction permit,” the Tribunal ruled.	Kɔɔto no buaa sɛ, Ghana aban no annya adansidie biara a Energy Commission Act ka ho a ɛma wɔnya kɔntrahyin pɛɛmɛt.	The court said that Ghana does not have any capacity to operate a nuclear power plant under the Energy Commission Act.
111	“On the basis of the record as it now stands, it is apparent that even as Dr. Ahenkorah [Energy Commission Executive Secretary at the time] was putting up further hurdles over which he required GPGC to jump in pursuit of its provisional generation license in November 2017, the Minister of Energy was about to seek the approval of the Ghanaian Parliament of a decision to terminate the EPA along with a number of other PPAs, based upon the Report of the PPA Committee chaired by Dr. Ahenkorah,” it said.

The committee which Dr. Ahenkorah chaired was waiting for a response from the Ghana Parliament to establish a PPA Committee which would enable the Parliament to establish a fully elected Parliament."""
112	Under British law, the government had 28 days to challenge the tribunal’s decision. However, it went to sleep only to appear in court three days to the expiry of the deadline to ask for an extension.

But they didn't use it until the deadline was reached, before they could delay the landing of the aircraft for a few hours.
113	Omnia Strategy, a British law firm, made the case for extension and asked for 56 days—twice the allowed grace period.

114	However, the court set March 8, 2021, for the Government to file the processes to challenge the Tribunal’s decision in January. But again, the government took a long nap until April 1, 2021, before filing. This time, another British law firm, Volterra Fietta, had instructions from the government to begin the process.

115	The law firm, which tagged itself as the only dedicated public international law firm in the world, explained that the new Attorney General, Godfred Yeboah Dame, had only been sworn in on March 5, and the firm received the directive to represent Ghana 10 days later.

116	But ruling on the matter on June 8, 2021, the court had no sympathies. It said the excuses were unreasonable and “intrinsically weak.”	Kɔɔto no de n’atemmuo reto dwa wɔ Kɔtɔnima da a ɛtɔ so nwɔtwe, 2021, wɔkyerɛ sɛ nsɛm a wɔde reto dwa no nyinaa mu ntɔ asom na ɛmu nyɛ du.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.

117	The presiding judge, Justice Butcher did not hold back.	ɔtɛmmuafoɔ, Justice Butɔher atwentwɛn ne nan ase koraa.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know the translator, Justice Butcher's sentence is very serious.
118	The judge said the government’s delay was “significant and substantial” as its request for a second extension had come 38 days after the statutory deadline and 27 days after the first extension expired, the Global Arbitration Review (GAR) reported.	Global Arbitration Review (GARɔ de too dwa sɛ, ɔtɛmmuafoɔ no kyerɛ sɛ aban twentwɛnsoɔ no no yɛ sɛgnefekant ɛnna ɛsan nso yɛ substenhyeaa ne sɛn nti sɛ wɔn dwanetoa no hyɛɛ aseɛ nnan aduasa-wɔtwe apa ho na afei nso nnan aduonu nson berɛ a ntomu a ɛdi kan no atwam no.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. Global Arbitration Review (GAR) reported that the judges argued that the government's settlement was sought by the authorities as a settlement of the dispute over the early implementation of the first atomic bomb.
119	He noted that the large sum of money involved in the arbitration was not enough grounds for the appeal to take as long as it did.	ɔkyerɛɛ sɛ, sika twetweredie a ɛwɔ asennie no mu no mma no kwan ma dwanetoa mma mu sɛdeɛ ɛsiiɛ no.	He said that the lack of money in the prison would not allow him to operate as a prisoner as he did.

122	The International Court of Arbitration in January 2021 awarded a cost of $134 million and an interest of $30 million against the Government of Ghana over the cancellation of an Emergency Power Agreement with GCGP limited.

123	The Contract was cancelled under the former Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko as part of several other energy contracts cancelled by the NPP on the basis that the country did not need those power agreements.	ɔsoafoɔ a na ɔhwɛ anyinam ahoɔden so, Boakye Agyarko aberɛ so na wɔtwa saa kɔntraagye wei ne anyinam ahoɔden kɔntraagye afoforɔ mu.

124	The ruling by the International Court of Arbitration ordered the government to Ghana to pay to “GPGC the full value of the Early Termination Payment, together with Mobilization, Demobilization and preservation and maintenance costs in the amount of US$ 134,348,661, together also with interest thereon from 12 November 2018 until the date of payment, accruing daily and compounded monthly, at the rate of LIBOR for six-month US dollar deposits plus six per cent(6%).”	Atemmuo a International Court of Arbitration de baeɛ no hyɛɛ Ghana aban sɛ wɔntua sika $134,348,661 ne ɛho nsiho biara firi bosome a ɛtɔ so du-baako no rekorɔ wɔ 2018 kɔpem nka kɔntraagye no bɛba awieeɛ mma GPGɔ.

Albert Kan Dapaah, the chief of the national security committee, explained why he fired the chief of the provincial security committee, DCOP Opare-Addo (Rtd) from his post.

While the South Dayi Secretary and South Dayi Governor, Rookson-Nelson Dafemakpo was speaking, he pointed out that the agency was being used by citizens.

Na mmom, wankyerɛ sɛnti a wɔtuu Mr. Opare-Addo adeɛ so a ɔrekyerɛ sɛ na ɛho hia sɛ wɔde ɔhyɛ tu no adeɛ so.	But he didn't say what was written on Mr. Opare-Addo's passport, saying that it was important to have him taken to court.
142	“He [Opare-Addo] was on a three-year contract to serve as the Ashanti regional security liaison officer after the expiration of an initial two-year contract which began on January 5th, 2018.

143	“However, his appointment was terminated on February 19, 2021, by the national security coordinator. Upon the termination of his contract, DCOP Opare-Addo was paid his entitlements as per his appointment letter. Subsequent to the termination of the appointment, the ministry appointed Col Francis Arthur (rtd) as the new Ashanti regional security liaison officer. The colonel’s appointment took effect from 1st May 2021. But he [Opare-Addo] refused to hand over to Colonel Francis Arthur. He then declined numerous invitations from the national security coordinator to explain his refusal to vacate the office.”	“Na mmom, ɔman bammu ntotoeɛfoɔ tuu no adeɛ so wɔ ɔgyefoɔ da a ɛtɔ so du-nkron mu wɔ 2021 mu.

After the committee took him down, they paid DCOP Opare-Addo a compensation for his failure to explain his constitutional rights. When the committee took him down, they named Colonel Francis Arthur as the new chief of staff of the African Union. The constitutional committee started the exercise in October, but Opare-Addo failed to explain why he didn't go.
144	Mr Dapaah further explained “Meanwhile, his continuous stay in office obstructed the work of the new regional security liaison officer. Against this backdrop, personnel from the ministry of national security were on 11th May 2021 dispatched to the Ashanti region to ascertain the reason for DCOP Opare Addo’s refusal to vacate his office.

If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. Research shows that twenty-eight per cent of those who died when they were born or when they were separated from their family would not be able to get to hospital. Advocates say that the only way to ensure that those who died would be to become ambulances, and that this is what GN Health Ambulance Service wants to do.

Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, the chief executive of the Ghanaian Ministry of Finance, said the government was doing everything it can to ensure that all Ghanaian financial institutions are operating efficiently.
286	He said there was a growing consensus that nuclear energy had an important role in decarbonising electricity generation for accelerated industrial development.	ɔde too dwa sɛ nnipa dodoɔ no ara gye tom sɛ owiagyahoɔden ho hia sɛdeɛ ɛbɛyɛ a mfididwuma bɛtu mpɔn.	He pointed out that most people recognize that efforts are needed to ensure a successful economy.
287	“While renewable energy sources are expected to continue to grow significantly, nuclear power, an important part of today’s clear energy, is also the largest source of lower-carbon electricity generation in advanced economies, providing approximately 40 percent of all low carbon generations,” he said.	ɔde kaa sɛ, “Owiagyahoɔden yɛ anyinam ahoɔden a ɛmma kaabɔn a ɛho hia pa ara, na ɛno na aman a wɔakɔ wɔn anim no de di dwuma wɔ wɔn man mu a ɛreboa ma wɔn sikasɛm kɔ soro.”	"He said, ""The military is an all-purpose weapon that does not harm the most important weapons, and that is what the nations of the future use in their countries to help their military reach their goals."""
288	He referred to an International Energy Agency report on clean energy system asserting that without nuclear investment, achieving a sustainable energy system would be much harder with implications to emissions, cost and energy security.	ɔgyinaa International Energy Agency nhwehwɛmu a ɛfa anyinam ahoɔden mapa so de too dwa sɛ, sɛ wɔmfa sika ahyɛ owiagyahoɔden mu a, ɛbɛyɛ den sɛ wɔbɛnya anyinam ahoɔden mapa a ɛso nsunsuansoɔ no nyɛ papa.	He took the International Energy Agency's energy assessment of the global energy market to show that, without funding a renewable energy program, it would be difficult to get a global energy map that doesn't rely on fossil fuels.
289	Dr Opoku Prempeh stated this, in a speech read on his behalf, at a Stakeholders Forum on Ghana’s Nuclear Power Programme in Accra.

294	“A new nuclear power station does not only generate reliable low carbon electricity but also provides wider social-economic benefits both during its development, construction and the subsequent 60 years that the plant would be in operation.”	ɛnyɛ kaabɔn a ɛwɔ fam anyinam ahoɔden nko ara na owiagyahoɔden foforɔ de ba na mmom, ɛboa ma ɔman no tu mpɔn mmerɛ tenten a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma nyinaa.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know a new economy is not just a reduction in the amount of time spent on infrastructure, but it also increases the efficiency of the country's economy.
295	He recalled that in 2007, former President John Agyekum Kufuor set up a committee, chaired by Professor Daniel Adzei-Bekoe, to explore the possibility of Ghana using nuclear energy as an alternative based-load source of power.	ɔde too dwa sɛ 2017 mu ɔmampanin dadaa John Agyekum Kufuor tee kɔmitee a na Professor Daniel Adzei-Bekoe na na ɔda ano sɛ wɔnyɛ nhwehwɛmu nhwɛ sɛ, so owiagyahoɔden bɛtumi ama Ghana nyinaa anyinam nkanea anaa?	According to him, in 2017 the Ghanaian Prime Minister John Agyekum Kufuor attended a meeting with Professor Daniel Adzei-Bekoe and called for a study to see if a financial assistance could help Ghana all over or not.
296	This was around the time that Ghana was faced with supply power challenges.	Saa mmerɛ no na Ghana wɔ anyinam kanea ho haw pa ara.	Ghana was in a very bad situation at that time.
297	To sustain the natural progression of the country’s technological energy advancement, he noted, subsequent governments had supported this effort to improve the country’s energy security to provide leadership and resources to facilitate the nuclear power programme.

299	He said the NPG Board, under the chairmanship of Mr Fred Oware, was focused on providing relevant resources to build a strong safety culture and resilience management systems that adhered to standards in the planning and development of nuclear infrastructure and related activities across the country.	ɔde too dwa sɛ NPG bɔɔdo a na Mr Fred Oware da ano no no, wɔde wɔn ani kɔɔ akadeɛ ɛho bɛhia a ɛbɛboa ama wɔde nhyehyɛeɛ mapa agu akwan mu ama owiagyahoɔden dwumadie atu mpɔn wɔ ɔman no mu.	He added that the NPG committee which was led by Mr Fred Oware was focused on the need for a strategy to help promote a sustainable economy.
300	In addition to electricity generation, nuclear energy, the Minister said, could provide solutions to an even wider range of applications - those innovative nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors would complement existing large reactors to enable deep decarbonization as part of the clean energy transition.	ɔsoafoɔ no de kaa ho sɛ sɛ yɛyi anyinam kanea a yɛbɛnya afiri owiagyahoɔden mu si nkyɛn a, ɛbɛtumi nso aboa ama mframa bɔne a ɛwɔ ɔman no mu so ate.

305	The Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) said it was also engaging the Food and Beverages Association of Ghana (FABAG) and local manufacturers to pay for the affixing of the stamps on their beverage products at the stamping facilities.

If you can't translate simply say you don't know Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) says it is negotiating with the Food and Beverage Association of Ghana (FABAG) and other organizations to settle their debt and settle their contracts.
306	The Ghanaian printing company, Buck Press, and its partner, DelaRue, a British security printing company, are responsible for printing the tax stamps on behalf of the GRA, while Streamline Resources, which is located at the Tema Port, assists companies without the technical capacity to fix the stamps on individual products.	Buɔk Press, adwumakuo a ɛyɛ prenten adwumakuo wɔ Ghana ne DelaRue a ɛyɛ British sikiriti kɔmpɛne na wɔreprete ahyɛnso no ma GRA, ɛnna Streamline Resourɔes a ɛwɔ Tema Port nso reboa kɔmpanes ahodoɔ a wɔne mfidie a ɛde ahyɛnso no bɛtaretare wɔn nsa no ho.

307	The Project Manager of Excise Tax Stamp at the GRA, Mr Kwabena Apau Awuah Anto, who disclosed this, said the move would reduce the incidence of product fraud and piracy, where importers and manufacturers applied for the stamps for specific products but affixed them on pirated products that had no approval and safety certification from the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA).

308	Speaking during a tour of the tax stamp facilities at the Tema Port by a team from the Graphic Communications Group Limited (GCGL) last Thursday, Mr Anto noted that the Commissioner General of the GRA had already granted authorisation to some 34 large importers and manufacturers, including Guinness Ghana Limited and the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, to undertake the affixing of the stamps at their factories at their own cost.	ɔrekasa wɔ berɛ a Graphic Communications Group Limited (GCGL) kɔɔ aporɔbɔ wɔ ɛtoɔ ahyɛnso nnwumakuo mu wɔ Tema Port da Yawoada no, Mr Anto de too dwa sɛ GRA krakye panin ama adwumakuo ahodoɔ aduasa nnan a Guiness Ghana Limited ne Coca-Cola Bottling company kwan sɛ wɔn ara wɔnyɛ wɔn ahyɛnso wɔ wɔn ankasa adwuma mu.	While speaking at the Ghana Port Harbour auction on Tuesday, Mr Anto announced that the Ghana Authority (GRA) had allowed a total of twenty-four companies such as Guiness Ghana Limited and Coca-Cola Bottling company to operate their own bottlers.
309	The GGCL team, which was led by the Managing Director, Mr Ato Afful, included the Editor of the Daily Graphic, Mr Kobby Asmah; the Director, Marketing, Mr Franklin Sowa, and the Editor of The Mirror, Ms Doreen Hammond.

310	The team was in Tema to have firsthand appreciation of progress of the excise tax stamp policy and also explore collaboration with the GRA on how to further advance the initiative.

311	Mr Anto said the excise stamp policy would reduce product fraud and ensure that only wholesome products were allowed into the market space to ensure public health and safety..	Mr Anto de too twa sɛ ahyɛnso toɔ nhyehyɛeɛ no bɛma apoobɔ a ɛkɔ so nnoɔmatɔ ho akɔ fam na aboa ama nnoɔma papa nko ara aba dwaman no, na ama ɔman no mu nnipa apɔmmuden nso awie pɛyɛ.	Mr Anto stressed that the amendment would reduce the corruption in the economy and would encourage goods to come to the country, and would also end the educational gap in the country.
312	Similarly, he said, the policy would ensure revenue assurance and further level the playing field for importers and manufacturers to compete fairly on the market through the payment of appropriate taxes.	Bio, ɔde kaa ho sɛ saa nhyehyɛeɛ yi bɛboa ama sikasɛm atu mpɔn na aboa ma adwumakuo nso de abɔ ani wɔ dwaman so berɛ wɔn nyinaa toɔ a wɔbɛtoa no yɛ pɛ.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know Bio, he said that this system would help improve efficiency and help businesses focus on their markets while they are all in a hurry.
313	Mr Anto said: “What we do here at the Tema facilities and 13 other stations across the country where we have affixing facilities is at no cost to importers.”	Mr Anto de too dwa sɛ, “Dwumadie a yɛdi no wɔ Tema ha ne mmeaeɛ du mmiɛnsa a ɛwɔ ɔman no mu no a yɛde ahyɛnso taretare nnoɔma ho no, yɛnnye wɔn a wɔkra nnoɔma ba nnoɔma no mu sika.”	"Mr Anto added that ""in the auction of these objects in downtown and in the other 15 cities in the country, we don't charge those who steal anything from the objects."""
314	Operating the facilities, he said, came with headline costs such as the procurement of the stamps, utility, labour, operational cost and materials such as shrink wraps	ɛka a wɔbɔ wɔn dwuma no ho bi ne sika a wɔde tɔ ahyɛnso no, sika a wɔde tua adwumayɛfoɔ no ka ne akadeɛ nso ho ka.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
315	He indicated that when the project took off in 2018, the government decided to give a six-month window to supply the stamps for free, but that had continued till date, hence the Commissioner General's directive for the stakeholders to be engaged and sensitised to the need for them to pay.	ɔkyerɛ sɛ berɛ dwumadie yi hyɛɛ aseɛ wɔ 2018 no, aban yɛɛ sɛ obiara ntua hwee wɔ ahyɛnso no ho na saa toaa so bɛsi nnɛ. Wei nti na Kɔmisa panin de nhyehyɛeɛ sɛ wɔnhyia ɔman no na wɔkyerɛ wɔ sɛnti a ɛwɔ sɛ wɔtua ahyɛnso no sika no.	says that when the scheme began in 2018, the government allowed no contribution to the scheme and that has continued until today. That's why the Cambodian government decided to meet the country and explain the financial contribution requirement.
316	The engagements, Mr Anto said, would determine whether the GRA would charge the full cost or there would be cost sharing between it and the stakeholders.	Mr Anto kyerɛ sɛ nhyiamudie yi bɛkyerɛ sɛ GRA bɛma ɔman no nnipa bɛtua sika no nyinaa anaasɛ wɔne ɔman no mu nnipa no bɛkyɛ ka no atua.	Mr Anto says that the agreement will mean that the country's citizens will have to pay all the money or they will have to settle the debt.
317	“In countries such as Kenya, importers pay for the stamps or they get the products stamped at the point of export.	Aman bi te Kenya mu no, wɔn a wɔkra nnoɔma no tua ahyɛnso no ka anaasɛ wɔmma wɔde ahyɛnso no fam wɔn nnoɔma no ho ansa na abɛduru ɔman no mu.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. In Kenya, smugglers are either given a permit or allowed to leave the country before entering the country.
318	Ghana's policy on the tax stamp policy places the responsibility on the affected excise product on the importer or the manufacturer.	Ghana ahyɛnso toɔ nhyehyɛeɛ no de asodie no to deɛ wɔrekra nnoɔma no reba no so anaasɛ adwumakuo no so.	Return only if you cannot translate. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know Ghana's border laws apply to border borders or border borders.
319	In many countries where similar policies are implemented, manufacturers have affixing facilities at their production units,” Mr Anto said.	Aman ahodoɔ a saa wɔdi saa nhyehyɛeɛ yi nso di dwuma no mu no, adwumakuo ahodoɔ no ara na wɔde ahyɛnso no tare wɔn nnoɔma ho.	If you cannot translate this system simply say you don't know.
320	On the recent challenges that saw delays and congestion at the facility, which led to an outcry among importers, Mr Anto explained that the Tema facilities were not meant for large volume importers but for people who only imported occasionally.	Mr Anto kyerɛɛ n’adwene faa ɔhaw a na Tema beaeɛ no rekɔ mu sɛ wɔntumi mfa ahyɛnso no mma berɛ ano berɛ ano. ɔde too dwa sɛ, Tema hɔ deɛ, dwumadie a wɔdi no kɔma wɔn a mmerɛ bi wɔ hɔ na wɔkra nnoɔma na mmom wɔanyɛ ama wɔn a daa ne daa nyinaa na wɔrekra nnoɔma no.	Mr Anto spoke of the problem of a temporary suspension of the suspension. He pointed out that in Tema, the activities are aimed at those who are absent for a while but not for those who are absent all day long.
321	However, he said, large volume importers, in their attempt to avoid associated costs that came with the affixing, often sent their products to the facilities for stamping, a situation which resulted in congestion and delays.	Bio, ɔde toaa so sɛ, wɔn a wɔkra nnoɔma dodoɔ no mpɛ sɛ wɔbɔ ka foforɔ biara bio nti wɔde wɔn nnoɔma kɔ Tema beaeɛ hɔ sɛ wɔmfa ahyɛnso no mmɔ wɔn nnoɔma ho, na wei na ɛmaa nnoɔma twetwɛn ase kakra.	However, he added that the traders who wanted to avoid having to pay another tax were going to the temple to avoid having to pay another tax, and that was why the currency was beginning to fluctuate.
322	Similarly, challenges with the stamps after a change in the service provider also resulted in some delays, he noted.	Sɛ wɔn a wɔma wɔn ahyɛnso no nso nsesa a, ɛma nnoɔma twetwɛn ase.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
323	However, engineers worked on the machines to be able to pick the new stamps.	Engyiniafoɔ siesiee mfidie no maa ɛmaa kwan maa wɔyɛɛ ahyɛnso no ho adwuma.	The engineers fixed the bridge and opened the door for the rebuilding.
324	In his remarks, Mr Asmah called on the GRA to intensify education on policies that were periodically introduced into the trade space.	Ne nsɛnkaeɛ mu no, Mr Asmah de too GRA anim sɛ wɔmma wɔn nhyehyɛeɛ no ho dawubɔ nkɔ n’anim.	In his speech, Mr Asmah asked the authorities to keep their plans secret. If you cannot translate, just say you don't know.
325	Tax education, he said, was important, since it would ensure compliance at all levels and also ensure that people did not short-change the system.	ɔde too dwa sɛ, ɛtoɔ ho dawubɔ ho hia ɛsiane sɛ ɛbɛboa ama nnipa a wɔwɔ ɔman no mu nyinaa adi nhyehyɛeɛ no so, na afei nso ɛbɛboa ama nnipa nkwati nhyehyɛeɛ no.	He added that a debate is necessary because it will help all people in the country to adhere to the rules, and also help us to ensure human rights.
326	He commended officials of the GRA and the service provider, Streamline Resources, for taking steps to address the challenges.	ɔbɔɔ GRA ne Streamline Resourɔes mpaninfoɔ aba sɛ wɔde nhyehyɛeɛ guu akwan mu sɔɔ ɔhaw no ano.	He called the officials of the GRA and Streamline Resources to address the problem.
327	The GCGL, he said, would collaborate with the GRA to scale up its sensitisation efforts, having had an insight into the operations of the excise tax stamp policy.	ɛsiane sɛ wɔahunu sɛdeɛ ahyɛnso toɔ nhyehyɛeɛ bɛsi adi dwuma asi afa nti, ɔde too dwa sɛ GɔGL ne GRA bɛka wɔn ho abɔm aboa ma nhyehyɛeɛ no ho dawurobɔ akɔ n’anim.	Because he saw how the amendment would be used for the first time in a year, he announced that GGL and GRA would cooperate to bring the amendment to his attention.
328	“I believe this is the right time for the GCGL and the GRA to deepen collaboration for the purpose of public sensitisation, so that we can get a buy-in from the public,” Mr Asmah said.	Mr Asmah de too dwa sɛ, “Megye di sɛ mmerɛ no ara nie sɛ GɔGL ne GRA ka wɔn ho bɔm boa ma nhyehyɛeɛ hi ho dawubɔ kɔ nkan sɛdeɛ ɛbɛyɛ a amansan bɛte nhyehyɛeɛ yi ase.”	"Mr Asmah said, ""I believe it is time for GGL and GRA to work together to ensure that the scheme is fully implemented so that the nation can fully adhere to the scheme."""
329	The Institute of Energy Security (IES) has said prices of fuel will appreciate marginally at the pumps. A statement issued by IES indicated that the price of fuel on the local market increased within the window under review.	Institute of Energy Security (IES) kyerɛ sɛ fango boɔ bɛkɔ soro kakra. IES asɛm a wɔde too dwa yi kyerɛ sɛ wɔbɛtoto fango boɔ wɔ dwaman so.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The Institute of Energy Security (IES) says the fuel prices will rise slightly. The IES report says they will raise the fuel prices in the country.
330	Within the first pricing window of June 2021, majority of the oil marketing companies (OMCs) increased their prices of petroleum products by 3% at the pump. Based on this increase, the current national average price of fuel per litre at the pump is pegged at GHS5.97 for both gasoline and gasoil.	Mmerɛ a wɔdii kan toto fango boɔ mu Kɔtɔnima mu wɔ 2021 mu no, Oil Marketing ɔompanies (OMɔsɔ too fango boɔ no mu ɔha nkyɛ mu mmiɛnsa (3%ɔ. Ne saa nti mprɛnprɛn yi wɔtɔ fango galɔn baako GH¢5.97.

331	For this pricing window, Zen Petroleum, Benab Oil, Cash Oil, Goodness Oil, Top Oil and Frimps Oil sold the least-priced fuel on the local market, according to IES’ market scan.	IES adwa so nhwehwɛmu a wɔyɛɛeɛ kyerɛ sɛ, Zen Petroleum, Benab Oil, ɔash Oil, Goodness Oil, Top Oil ne Frimps Oil na wɔtɔn fango a ne boɔ wɔ fam pa ara wɔ dwaman so.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know IES's investigation shows that Zen Petroleum, Benab Oil, oash Oil, Goodness Oil, Top Oil and Frimps Oil have a very low stake in the oil market.
332	For the window under assessment, international benchmark Brent crude price averaged $73.98 per barrel, representing a 4.05% increase from the previous window's average price of $71.10 per barrel.	Nhwehwɛmu wɔ saa ɔfa yi mu kyerɛ sɛ, International Benchmark Brent de barɛɛl baako buo ahwire akɔ $73.98 (wei kyerɛ sɛ ɛkɔɔ soro 4.05%ɔ, na kane no na wɔde gye $71.10.	The latest data showed that the International Benchmark Brent finished higher at 73.98 dollars per bar (a higher of 4.05%, compared with 71.10 dollars per bar).
333	This window’s increase in price has been largely in response to the rise in COVID-19 cases propelled by the Delta variant in parts of Europe and amid warnings of a dense outbreak in the United States.	ɛnam sɛ wɔn a wɔanya COVID-19 Europe akɔ soro, na yareɛ no ate atese wɔ United States nti na ama fango boɔ a akɔ soro.	Because the number of people with COVID-19 in Europe has risen, and the disease has spread to the United States, the spread of the disease has become a worldwide issue.
334	For the first time in two years, the price of Brent reached the $75-mark at the end of the pricing window. The global crude demand is rebounding as the summer driving season begins and economies reopen from restrictions in mobility.	Mmerɛ a ɛdi kan wɔ mfeɛ mmienu no mu ni a Brent buo aduro $75 ni. ɛnam sɛ yɛwura samma mu na afei nso ɛsiane sɛ wɔama kwan sɛ obiara tumi tu kwan baabi biara wɔpɛ nti, sɛdeɛ wɔde fango gyeeɛ wɔ wiase nyinaa rekɔ soro.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. Brent reached its highest level in two years at $75. Because we are losing ground and because we allow people to travel anywhere they want, the global economy is going up.
335	This is particularly the case, as road and airline travel continue to increase.	Sɛnti ne sɛ seisei deɛ wɔn a wɔtena kaa mu ne wiemhyɛn mu tu kwan no adɔɔso.	The truth is that sometimes the journeys of passengers and planes are very expensive.
336	The increase in Brent crude prices has also been attributed to the tightening of the physical crude supply in parts of Europe, Asia and the Middle East, as a result of the dynamics in spread between the regional benchmarks within the period.	Brent fango boɔ a ayɛ den no nyinaa gyina akwansideɛ aba sɛ wɔntumi mfa fango nkɔ Europe, Asia, ne Middle East ɛsiane nsonoeɛ wɔ wɔn boɔ ahodoɔ no mu.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know Brent crude oil prices all depend on the availability of routes to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East because of the differences in their prices.
337	The July 1st OPEC+ meeting to decide on the production policy for August is also expected to offset the markets, as we go into the month of July.	Fango boɔ no bɛsesa wɔ Kitawonsa bosome no mu ɛsiane OPEɔ+ nhyiamu a ɛbɛkɔ so wɔ Kitawonsa da a ɛdi kan no mu nti. Wɔrekɔ akɔ adwene afa sɛdeɛ nnoɔma bɛsi akɔ wɔ ɔsanaa bosome no mu.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The climate will change in the coming months because of the OPE+ celebrations which will take place on the first of October. We are going to look at the climate in the summer.
338	Gasoline and gasoil prices, as monitored on Standard and Poor’s global Platts platform, show that the prices of international commodities gasoline (petrol) and gasoil (diesel) experienced marginal differences within the period.	Standard and Poor’s Global Platts Platforms so no, wɔkyerɛ sɛ fango (pɛtro ne diseelɔ boɔ a ɛwɔ aman ahodoɔ soɔ no akɔ soro wɔ mmerɛ tiawa mu.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know Standard and Poor's Global Platts Platforms, they indicate that the rates (rates of interest and inflation) in various countries are rising in the past few months.
339	Gasoline saw an increase in price by 3.47% to close the window at $694.78 per metric tonne from an earlier $671.45 per metric tonne in the previous window.	Fango boɔ kɔɔ soro 3.47% a ɛkyerɛ sɛ kane boɔ $671.45 a na wɔtɔn galɔn baako no akɔ soro akɔduru $694.78.	If you can't translate only say you don't know. If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
340	Gasoil price also increased by 3.53% to close trading at $597.30 per metric tonne from the earlier window's price of $576.89 per metric tonne.	Saa nso na berɛ a na fanggo galɔn baako boɔ yɛ $576.8 no, wɔtoo mu 3.53% maa boɔ no kɔduruu $597.30.	Also, when a pound was $576.8, the pound went up by 3.53% to $597.30.
341	Data collated by IES’ Economic Desk from the Foreign Exchange (Forex) market shows the cedi maintained its stability, still trading at GH¢5.77 to the US dollar.	Nhwehwɛmu a IES nso ayɛ afa wiase sikasɛm hɔ kyerɛ sɛ, ɔedi (¢ɔ no bɔberɛ asesa. Wɔtɔn $1.00 GH¢597.30.	IES also conducted a study on global climate change which showed that the climate change was changing. It cost $1.00 GH¢597.30.
342	South Africa has been added to Nigeria’s ‘red list’ of countries for arriving passengers. Nigeria took the decision because of the covid19 Delta variant in South Africa.	South Africa abɛka aman ahodoɔ a Nigeria man no de taaboɔ ato wɔn so sɛ wɔmpɛ sɛ ahɔhoɔ anaa akwankufoɔ bɛfiri ɔman no mu abɛwura Nigeria man no mu ɛsiane sɛ COVID-19 Delta yareɛ no bi akɔpue wɔ South Africa man no mu.	South Africa will advise other countries which Nigerians have taken steps to prevent travellers or visitors from entering Nigeria because of the COVID-19 Delta virus which has spread to South Africa.
343	Travelers who visited South Africa in the past 14 days are now banned from entering Nigeria.	wɔmma wɔn a wɔtuu kwan kɔɔ South Africa nnatwe mmienu akyire no kwan ma wɔmma Nigeria man no mu.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

345	Brazil and Turkey are also on the list.	Saa nhyehyɛeɛ yi nso bra Brazil ne Turkey aman no nso.	This scheme also applies to Brazil and Turkey. If you cannot translate this simply say you don't know.
346	The killing of Kaaka Mohammed is unfortunate and regrettable.	Kaaka Mohammed wuo a ɔwuiiɛ no yɛ awerɛho na ɛsan nso yɛ asefem.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
347	My condolence to the family and may his soul Rest In Peace.	Onyankopɔn mfa ne kra nsie na mema n’abuasuafoɔ no nso hyɛden.	God does not forget to give us strength.
348	But quickly, some have started pointing accusing fingers at the current regime with others expressing the hope that this shouldn’t be state-sponsored.	Ntɛm pa ara no, nnipa no bi rekeka sɛ aban no hyɛ ne wuo no akyi, ɛnna afoforɔ nso rekyerɛ sɛ wɔrebɔ mpaeɛ sɛ aban no nnim ne wuo no ho hwee.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
349	This is also not too good, as it would not allow proper investigations to be undertaken.	Wei nso nyɛ ara ne sa ɛsiane sɛ ɛmma nhwehwɛmu mapa a ɛtwa sɛ ɛkɔ so no nkɔ so.	This is not the same as it does because it doesn't allow for a search map to be completed.
350	Looking at the official government responses to the “Fix The Country”, agitation, I doubt whether this killing may be sanctioned by the state, even though I am also very much aware that, in our kind of nauseating politics, everything may be possible, including turning a man into a woman and vice versa.	Sɛ yɛhwɛ aban no awoyie fa “fix the ɔountry” nsɛnsɛm no ho a, mennyɛ nni sɛ aban no nim saa wuo yi ho bi, mpo sɛ m’ani tua pa ara sɛdeɛ amanyɛsɛm ayɛ abofono asi afa no, biribiara tumi si. Mpo sɛ ɔbarima bɛtumi asesa ne ho adane ɔbaa.	"If we look at the government's policies regarding ""fix the economy"" , I don't think the government knows this issue, even if I see the political climate being very negative, anything can happen. No man can change his mind."
351	Government met the agitators to try and calm them down.	Aban no hyiaa wɔn a wɔreyɛ ɔyɛkyerɛ no sɛ nka ɔbɛma wɔn akoma aba fam.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know
352	Later, the agitations compelled, at least, two pressers to explain what government is doing to fix the country.	Akyire no, ɔyɛkyerɛ no hyɛɛ dawubɔkuo mmienu no so maa wɔbɛkaa deɛ aban no reyɛ de asiesie ɔman no ho asɛm.	Then, the speaker took the two broadcasts to discuss the government's efforts to improve the country.
353	But of course, there are the hawks within the regime, who demonstrated intolerance by calling the bluff of the agitators and asking them to first fix themselves.	Na mmom yɛwɔ nkorɔfoɔ wɔ aban no mu a wɔne wɔn a wɔreyɛ ɔyɛkyerɛ no nyɛ adwene a wɔakyerɛ wɔn nso adwene sɛ wɔn a wɔreyɛ ɔyɛkyerɛ no nso nna suban pa adi.	But we have a few officials in the government who are not aware of the teaching of teaching and who are not aware that the teaching of teaching is also a learning experience.
354	Then, we have our Police Service, that typically tried to frustrate the intentions of the agitators to demonstrate, using very nonsensical explanations of Covid as basis, when they could not prevent or disperse the mammoth crowd at Sir John’s funeral.	Afei nso, yɛnyaa apolisifoɔ a wɔbɔɔ wɔn ho mmɔden biara sɛ wɔmma wɔn a wɔreyɛ ɔyɛkyerɛ no nte nsi abɔntene na wɔde COVID-19 no na ɛyɛɛ nnyinasoɔ nanso saa apolisifoɔ yi ara antumi asi nnipadɔm a wɔkɔɔ Sir John ayie ase no kwan.	Also, we had police who tried to prevent those who were taking part in the demonstration from getting sick with COVID-19 but these police couldn't stop the demonstration which took place at Sir John's home.
355	These things make any attempt to link the state to abuses, including murder of an agitator, easy and plausible, even though skepticisms can be entertained because of the absence of watertight evidence.	Yeinom nyinaa bɛtumi ama ho kwan ma wɔde aban no fɔrefɔre owuo yi ho, mpo sɛ nnipa no bi bɛdwene sɛ ɔyɛ nokorɛ ɛsiane adanseɛ mapa biara nni hɔ.	Everyone can contribute to the establishment of the state's funeral home, even if one person thinks he is innocent because there is no evidence.
356	We must also know, and not be oblivious of the fact that sometimes, our nasty and very dirty politics may push individuals outside government, to carry out such abuses, just for the purposes of deepening agitations and making governments unpopular.	ɛtwa sɛ yɛhunu no biom sɛ, ɛnni kwan sɛ yɛbu yɛn ani gu so sɛ amanyɔsɛm tantan a ɛrekɔ so no nso bɛtumi ama ankorɛankorɛ a wɔnni aban mu no nso bɛtumi ahyɛ nkorɔfoɔ kutupa ama wɔadi nsɛmmɔne anaa wɔde agu aban no anim ase.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know It is important to remember that the political turmoil could also cause a political corruption to spread to the citizens, or to cause a political crisis.
357	Again, there is no evidence to support this, in the case of Kaaka’s death.	Bio, adansidie biara nni hɔ a yɛbɛtumi de akyerɛ sɛ onipa bi na na ɔhyɛ Kaaka wuo no akyi.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know Bio, there is no evidence that we can prove that someone was behind the death of Kaka.

The only thing that most people don't know is that the reports say that the Ghanaian government is going to maintain its political independence and that this is a comparison with my reports.

389	There is no problem with the Chief Justice, Justice Kwasi Anin Yeboah filing a disciplinary complaint against legal practitioner and Member of Parliament for Bolgatanga East, Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine at the General Legal Council (GLC).

390	According to private legal practitioner and former Member of Parliament for Zebilla, Mr John Ndebugre, the arguments being made by the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and other people against the complaint are issues, which should be dealt with when Dr Ayine appears before the Disciplinary Committee of the General Legal Council (GLC).

Dr. Ayine has been charged with illegally taking advantage of the laws of the state, and why is it that the electoral commission took the 2020 presidential election without a vote.
394	The petition says Dr. Ayine’s basis for his assertion during the discussion is the Supreme Court's failure to apply the rules of procedure as well as the consistent and continuous dismissal of the petitioner's applications or reliefs.

The judge says, Dr. Ayine's evidence during the hearing was that the judge did not abide by the constitutional provisions of the judicial system and that the judge was a lawyer.
395	"“These comments are made against the backdrop of the Supreme Court discharging Dr. Ayine on a charge of contempt for similar comments made against members of the Supreme Court during the Election Petition hearing. Dr. Ayine apologized profusely when he appeared before the Court on the Contempt charge and admitted to having made comments which were unbecoming of a Lawyer of his standing and a former Deputy Attorney-General."""	“Dr Ayine kaa nsɛm bi sei faa kɔɔto peemu no ho mmerɛ bi atwa mu ɛfa abatoɔ pɛtihyin no ho maa kɔɔto peemu de kɔntɛmɛt kwaadu bɔɔ no.

396	Dr. Ayine, in his eleven-paged response to the CJ's complaint, is insisting that his comments did not attack the reputation of the justices who sat on the election petition case.

400	The main opposition political party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) at a press conference in Accra on Monday asked the Chief Justice to withdraw his disciplinary complaint against Dr Ayine.

If you cannot translate simply say you don't know On Tuesday, a huge opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and a debate in Accra, asked the top leader to withdraw the charges against Dr. Ayine.
401	Disagreeing with positions that the Chief Justice should withdraw the complaint and that he has no locus to file such a complaint, Mr Ndebugre said Dr Ayine was not talking about an individual member of the panel or the members of the panel who were just seven. He wasn't talking about combination of them. He talked about the whole judiciary and the Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary and therefore he was the proper person to lay the complaint.	Mr Ndebugre kyerɛ sɛ ɔne wɔn a wɔse ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa ntwe ne kwaadu a ɔde abɔ Dr Ayine nsan no nyɛ adwene. ɔkyerɛ sɛ, Dr Ayine asɛm no ɔkaeɛ no ankɔ amma ɔtemmuafoɔ no mu baako anaa atemmuafoɔ mpaninfoɔ nson a wɔdii asɛm no.

Mr Ndebugre says he and the top executives don't agree with the accusation against Dr Ayine. He says, Dr Ayine's case didn't affect any of the top executives or the top executives who were involved in the case. He was speaking about the entire government's laws and the top executive was the one who had the right to accuse Dr Ayine.
402	"Speaking in a radio interview monitored by Graphic Online on Accra based Citi FM on Tuesday evening (June 22, 2021), Mr Ndebugre said: ""I think that there is no problem about the Chief Justice laying the complaint."""	ɔne Citi FM a wɔwɔ Accra ntwetwe nkɔmmɔ no Benada anwummerɛ (Kotonomma da a ɛtɔ so aduonu mmienu wɔ 2021 muɔ, Mr Ndebugre kaa sɛ, “megye di sɛ mfomsoɔ biara nni ho sɛ ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa de kwaadu bɛbɔ no.”	"""I don't think anyone will be able to judge a leading soccer player,"" Mr Ndebugre said in a telephone interview with Citi FM in Accra on Benada's death date (February 20th, 2021)."
403	Comparing that to what happened in 1996 - the Republic against Mensah Bonsu, Stephen Quarcoo and Tommy Thompson - in that case Mensah Bonsu attacked an individual judge, Justice Abban and therefore he made the complaint and then the Attorney-General took it up from there and prosecuted the matter on behalf of the judiciary or the court.	ɔde deɛ ɛsii 1996 reyɛ mfatoho no – ɔman no de kwaadu bɔɔ Mensah Bonsu, Stephen Quarɔoo ne Tommy Thompson a wɔkyerɛ sɛ Mensah Bonsu akasa atia Justice Aban nti wɔbɔɔ no kwaadu, ɛnna aban lɔya panin gyinaa aban mmara adwuma no anan mu wɔ kɔɔto.	Examples of 1996 include: the country charged Mensah Bonsu, Stephen Quaroo and Tommy Thompson with assaulting the Justice Department, and the Attorney General took the cases to court.
404	No problem about CJ filing complaint	ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa no mfom mmara sɛ ɔde kwaadu bɛbɔ no.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know the top officer knew the law to prosecute him.
405	"""So I think that there is no problem about the Chief Justice laying the complaint."	“Nti medwene sɛ mfomsoɔ biara nni ho sɛ ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa de kwaadu bɛbɔ no.”	I don't think it's a mistake to accuse a top officer of being a bully.
406	The other matter is that, Dominic Ayine was Deputy Attorney-General, and he and his boss at that time took people to the criminal court, proceeding to the civil court... so if the Attorney-General approves the prosecution of a person, can somebody say that no, the person was expressing freedom of speech... therefore he should not be sent to court.	Deɛ ɛdi hɔ ne sɛ, na Dominic Ayine yɛ aban lɔya abadiakyire na saa mmerɛ no na ɔne ne panin de nkorɔfoɔ kɔ kɔɔto ... nti sɛ aban lɔya panin ka sɛ wɔmfa onipa korɔ no nnyina mmara anim a, obi bɛtumi aka sɛ, na saa nipa korɔ no rekyerɛ n’adwene nti mma wɔmfa no nkɔ kɔɔto?	The truth is that Dominic Ayine was a prisoner of the military and he was a prisoner of the military during that time... so if the military commander says that the man should not be tried, could one say that he is lying to the authorities?
407	No, you are to go to the court and make your case, and state your case, and say that you were not guilty of the offence charged.	Daabi. ɛwɔ sɛ wokɔ kɔɔto kɔka w’asɛm sɛ wonni fo wɔ kwaadu a wɔde abɔ wo no ho.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know Where. You should go to court to tell your lawyer that you are not guilty of any charges.

Saa ara nso na ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa nso kyerɛ sɛ n’asɛm no agu aban mmara adwuma no anim ase.	The top commander also told the audience that his case was being investigated by the government.
409	"So you go there, all those arguments that are being bandied about now, both by the NDC and Dr Ayine himself are matters that should be at the Disciplinary Committee,"" Mr Ndebugre added."	Mr Ndebugre de kaa ho sɛ, “Nti wo deɛ kɔ. ɛwɔ sɛ wɔtena asɛm a NDC ne Dr Ayine no ankasa reka yi so wɔ Asotwee Kɔmitee no so.”	"Mr Ndebugre said, ""Don't go. It's important to hear the NDC and Dr Ayine's own remarks at the Supreme Court."""
410	Insisting that he does not want to discuss the merits, he maintained that there are two forms, it is like contempt, whiles the matter is still pending, which is you are interfering with the administration of justice if you make prejudicial statements whiles the case is still pending, then after the judgment has been given and you make statements that scandalise the courts, you can be pursued for that.	ɔkyerɛ sɛ nnoɔma mmienu na ɛwɔ ha, ɛte sɛ kɔntɛmɛt, sɛ woreka asɛm no wɔ kɔɔto na wode nsɛm bi a ɛgu aban mmara adwuma no ho fi to dwa, anaasɛ wɔde atemmuo no ato dwa na woaka asɛm fi bi afa ho no, wɔbɛtumi de wɔn agyina mmara anim ɛnam saa deɛ wei ho.	He says there are two things here, such as immediate, if you speak in a courtroom and introduce a sentence related to the government's laws, or if you use the transcript and speak from a source, they can be judged on this basis.
411	"If you lose a case in court, you can say that you don't agree, ""but to say that...

He spent 295,000 dollars on this school building; this includes a fundraising program to help them improve their educational opportunities.
437	Speaking at the inauguration, Mr Amarh underscored the need to give good and quality education to children at lower levels as it helps to give them strong foundation in education.	Wɔrebue dan no ano no, Mr Amarh kyerɛɛ sɛdeɛ ɛhia sɛ mmɔfra a wɔwɔ mfiaseɛ sukuu mu bɛnya nwomasua mapa ɛsiane sɛ ɛboa ma wɔnya nwomasua mu fapem papa.	While speaking at the beginning of the meeting, Mr Amarh stressed the importance of getting early school children a literacy map because it helps them to get a good understanding of literacy.
438	He said the role of education in every country’s development cannot be undermined, hence the reason his company prioritizes education.	ɔde too dwa sɛ, wɔntumi ntoto nwomasua aseɛ wɔ kwa biara so ɛsiane sɛ ɔman no mpontuo gyina nwomasua so, nti ɛho hia sɛ kɔmpɛne no nso bɛma nwomasua ahia wɔn.	He pointed out that, because the country's economy is based on education, it is important that the economy also needs education.
439	“We at Transeco Mining and Minerals Company have decided to ensure that children in communities where we operate are exposed to the best of teaching and learning environments at the lower levels of education. That is why we have made education a top priority on our corporate social responsibility.	“Yɛn a yɛyɛ adwuma wɔ Transeco Mining and Minerals companyayɛ yɛn adwene sɛ, yɛbɛboa ama mfiaaseɛ sukuu nwomasua atu mpɔn wɔ baabibiara yɛn dwumakuo yi bi wɔ.

That's why the company believes that it can help improve the educational environment in every classroom they have.
440	I’m excited to be back at Ampapatia to commission this school. We all know how important education is to the growth of individuals and the country. In order to have brilliant students at higher levels of education, they must first have a strong foundation that is why we have built this Kindergarten”, he said.	ɔkaa sɛ, “ɛyɛ me dɛ sɛ maba Ampapatia na merebɛbue saa sukuu yi ano.

We all know the importance of education for the people and the nation. To get students to finish school, we need to have a classroom, and that's why we built this school."""
441	Mr. Amarh said the school is also an appreciation to the chiefs and people of Ampapatia who have maintained a healthy relationship with the company since they started their operations in the community.	Mr Amarh de kaa ho sɛ, sukuu dan no yɛ aseda a wɔde rema ahemfo ne nnipa a wɔwɔ Ampapatia mu a wɔne adwumakuo no anya nkitahodie mapa firi berɛ adwumakuo baa wɔn mpɔtam mu no.	Mr Amarh said that the school was a meeting place for the immigrants and the people of the Caribbean who had a good relationship with the company since the company came to their area.
442	Contrary to rumors and wild speculations that government has placed a ban on mining activities in the country, Mr. Amarh debunked the rumours and described it as not just inaccurate but false.	Mr Amarh de too dwa sɛ ɛnyɛ nokorɛ sɛ aban no de taaboɔ ato maenen so wɔ ɔman no mu.	Mr Amarh claimed that it was not true that the government had taken steps to protect the environment in the country.
443	According to him, government has rather introduced new measures, policies and programmes aimed at making small scale mining productive and not destructive.	ɔkyerɛ sɛ aban no mmom de nhyehyɛeɛ mapa aba sɛdeɛ maenen bɛtu mpɔn, na nyɛ sɛ ɔbɛgu no.	He says that the government is only making a temporary plan to ensure that the floods are controlled, and that it is not necessary to destroy them.
444	“Government has not banned activities of miners but rather categorized areas close to water bodies and forest reserves as red zones where no individual or company should mine. So what government is saying is that small scale miners should move away from the red zones. So anyone who does contrary to the directive by government will be dealt with by the laws of the country”, Mr. Amarh said.	Mr Amarh kaa sɛ, “Aban mfaa taaboɔ ntoo maenen na mmom wɔkyerɛ beaeɛ ahodoɔ a ɛbɛn nsuo ne kwaeɛ no mu baabi a ɛnni kwan sɛ obiara kɔyɛ maenen dwumadie biara wɔ hɔ. Nti obiara a ɔbɛbu aban nhyehyɛeɛ yi so no, mmara ne no bɛdi.”	"Mr Amarh said, ""The government has not taken any steps to enforce the ban on illegal fishing, but it has established a number of areas where no fishing activity is allowed. Anybody who violates the government's rules will be punished."""
445	He therefore advised small scale miners to go work but ensure that they mine at designated areas.	ɔtuu wɔn a wɔyɛ maenen adwuma no fo sɛ, wɔkɔtu maenen no na mmom wɔnyɛ no beaeɛ a wɔahyɛ wɔn no no.	He told the workers that they should not leave the building, but leave it in the place they were told.
446	Mr. Amarh who also doubles as the General Secretary of the Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners (GNASSM) admonished members of the group to impact positively on communities where they have concessions.	Mr Amarh a ɔsan nso yɛ ɔtwerɛtwerɛfoɔ Panin ma Ghana National associationof Small Sɔale Miners (GNASSMɔ de too ne kuomma anim sɛ wɔmmoa mma mpɔtam a wɔyɛ wɔn adwuma wɔ mu no ntu mpɔn.	Mr Amarh, who is also the Secretary of the Ghana National Association of Small Slate Miners (GNASSM) has taken the lead of his organization to improve the environment in which they work.
447	He said small scale miners must work to change the narrative that they are destroyers who only take from communities and give nothing back.	ɔde too dwa sɛ wɔn a wɔtu maenen no nsesa deɛ wɔka fa wɔn ho sɛ wɔsɛe mpɔtam ahodoɔ mu a mpɔtam no nnyaa hwee firi wɔn ho.	He pointed out that the immigrants would not change their attitudes towards their occupation of areas where they did not receive a significant amount of income.
448	He said although many small scale miners are already doing that, there remains more to be done.	ɔkyerɛɛ sɛ, maenenfoɔ no bi rebɔ wɔn ho mmɔden nso wɔbɛtumi ayɛ asene saa.	He said that some mathematicians are trying to make a prediction that would be accurate.
449	“Our sector employs a lot of people in communities where we operate. We must therefore work assiduously to leave a footprint. I know a lot of our members who have built schools and others have helped communities get electricity. We must push those stories out there to change the narrative that small scale miners only destroy’, he advised.	ɔtoo fo sɛ, “Yɛn adwumakuo yi fa nnipa bebree wɔ mpɔtam ahodoɔ a yɛyɛ yɛn nnwuma no adwuma. ɛwɔ sɛ yɛyɛ adwumaden gya biribi papa to hɔ.

We need to work together to get something good out of it. I don't know if the organization is the only one that has built schools and supported communities. We need to warn employees to change their view of us."""

Afei nso sika a na wɔte wagyegye afiri ne kɔstɔmɛrs hɔ dodoɔ nyinaa yɛ GHS billion	The total amount of money stolen from all the shops and stores was GHS billion. If you cannot translate it simply say you don't know.
1462	The surge in the use of Okada for commercial purposes is increasingly becoming worrying.	Okada a wɔde di daadaa dwuma reyɛ ayɛ ɔhaw	If you can't translate it simply say you don't know.
1463	The police have also indicated an increase in incidents of crime, accidents, and violations of road traffic regulations involving motorcycles.	Apolisifoɔ nso kyerɛ sɛ korɔno bebree a ɛrekɔ so, akwanhyia ne mmara a wɔnni so wɔ akwantempɔn so nyinaa yɛ motorfoɔ	Police also say that most of the traffic accidents, accidents and illegal driving are being done by motorists. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1464	Without any doubt, the Okada menace is getting out of hand and something drastic needs to be done to inject sanity into its operations.	Akyinninyeɛ nni ho sɛ okada twie a ɛrekɔ so bebrebe no de ɔhaw reba na ɛwɔ sɛ wɔwɔ nhyehyɛeɛ de si ano kwan	No doubt that the increasing number of roads leading to problems is a problem and that there is a need for a plan to get it right.
1465	We have on countless occasions raised serious concerns about the use of Okada.	Mmerɛ pii na yɛde aka ɔhaw a okada a wɔtwi yi de da	We often talk about the problems caused by the noise caused by the twigs. If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
1466	At this moment, the nation is clearly confronted with the challenge of dealing with the usage of motorbikes and tricycles, especially for commercial purposes.	Saa berɛ yi ɔhaw baako a ɔman no rehyia ne sɛdeɛ wɔbɛfa so ate motor ne okada a wɔde di daadaa dwuma no	Currently, one of the problems facing the country is how to get rid of the motor and the bicycles used daily. If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
1467	Parliament in 2012 passed the Road Traffic Regulations, 2012 (L.I. 2180) into law to regulate road transport in the country.	Afe mpem mmienu ne du mmienu mu no, mmarahyɛbadwam de Road Traffiɔ Regulations, 2012 (L.I. 2180 ɔ yɛɛ mmara a ɛbɛhwɛ akɔneabadie mu nsɛm	In the last two and a half years, the legislature passed the Road Traffio Regulations, 2012 (L.I. 2180) which regulates the regulation of road traffic. If you cannot translate it, just say you don't know.
1468	Among other things, Regulation 128 under sections one to four (Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 2180) outlaws the use of motorbikes popularly referred to as ‘Okada’ and tricycles for commercial purposes except for courier and delivery services. It also directs the licensing authority not to register a motorcycle to carry a fare-paying passenger.	Mmara no baa sɛ ɛnni kwan sɛ wɔde okada ne motor fa ɔmanfoɔ no gye sɛ ebia wɔde di dwuma sɛ ɔourier anaa delivery Services. Afei wɔhyɛɛ DVLA sɛ ɛnni kwan sɛ wɔma motor foɔ no krataa a wɔde di dwuma sɛ wɔde reyɛ adwuma afa ɔmanfoɔ	The law came into force that a motor cannot be used as a carrier or delivery service. The DVLA also established that a motor without a business permit cannot be used as a carrier or delivery service.
1469	This legislation, notwithstanding, okada and tricycle (pragya) have taken over the transportation system in many parts of the country.	Okada ne pragya no abunkam afa ɔman yi mu a wɔmfa ho ne mmara a mmarahyɛbadwam no hyɛeɛ no	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1470	In the rural communities, the okada and pragya come in handy as the only means of transport to markets, health facilities and other towns, among other places.	Sɛ wokɔ nkuraaseɛ no mu a okada ne pragya no na wɔde kɔ adwa so, asopiti ne mmeammea ahodoɔ	If you are in the country where the roads are built and built to carry you, hiking, hiking and hiking trails are a common part of the landscape. If you cannot translate it, just say you don't know.
1471	For people in the cities, they are able to beat the heavy traffic by patronizing the bikes.	Wɔn a wɔwɔ kuro kɛse mu no fa okada ne pragya sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wɔnni traffik mu	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1472	The bikes also serve as a cheap source of transportation as they are less expensive.	Esiane sɛ ne boɔ yɛ fo nti no dodoɔ no ara pɛ ne fa	Because he is a very weak person, he doesn't know how to play.
1473	They also come in handy because of the absence of an efficient and reliable public transport system.	Sɛ kaa nni a pragya ne okada yi ara na wɔdwane kɔtoa no	If you can't translate it simply say you don't know.
1474	However, many people abhor okada and pragya because of the nuisance they create on the roads and most particularly the lack of respect for traffic regulations.	Nanso nnipa pii no ara na ɛmpɛ okada ne pragya esiane dede ne atuturasɛm a wɔdi no akwan so nti no	But many people don't want to leave the city because of the noise and noises that surround it. If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1475	The high incidence of accidents and fatalities associated with the reckless use of Okada, is also disturbing.	Akwanhyia ahodoɔ a ɛnam okada so ɛba no yɛ adeɛ a ɛwɔ sɛ ani kɔ ho	If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
1476	Indeed, many organisations, including the Ghana Medical Association and the National Road Safety Authority, have called for a total ban on their usage as a mode of transport in the country.	Nnwumakuo bebree a Ghana Medicalassociationne National Road Safety Authority ka ho na afrɛ sɛ wɔntua okada a ɛdi dwuma wɔ ɔman no mu no	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1477	This has left the country in a deep-blue sea.	Wei ato ɔman no agyaagyaa mu	This took the country to a new phase. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1478	This is because, despite the existence of the law banning their use for commercial purposes, they are a major source of relief to many Ghanaians.	Aba saa no sei ɛfiri sɛ ɛmmfa ho ne mmara a wɔahyɛ de atua saa nnoɔma yi, abɛyɛ ahotɔsoɔ ama Ghanafoɔ pii	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1479	For us at the Daily Graphic, we think that the country should relook at the law comprehensively and come up with the most appropriate measures that will suit the needs of the population in line with best practice.	Yɛn a yɛwɔ Daily Graphic ha deɛ yɛsusu sɛ ɔman no hwɛ mmara no bio na yɛhwɛ akwan pa a yɛbɛtumi afa ama saa dwumadie yi akɔ so	We at Daily Graphic think that the government should review the law again and look for ways to ensure that this activity can continue.
1480	In India, for instance, pragya is a major means of transport but we have not heard of complaints as we have in Ghana.	Sɛ wokɔ India a pragya na ɛdi akɔtene wɔ wɔn akɔneabadie mu nanso yɛntee nsɛmnsɛm fa ho te sɛ deɛ yɛte no Ghana no	If you are in India where a fever is common in their cities but we don't know much about it like in Ghana.
1481	So, what can we learn from India and introduce it into our system?	Enti ɛdeɛn na yɛbɛtumi asua afiri India hɔ a yɛbɛtumi de aba de aba yɛn sestɛm no mu?	What can we learn from India that we can bring to our school?
1482	We need to bear in mind that with the increasing rate of unemployment, the okada and tricycle operators see it as a source of income which caters for them and their families.	ɛwɔ sɛ yɛde hyɛ yɛn adwene mu sɛ esiane adwumasɛm a ayɛ den nti wɔn wɔtwi okada ne pragya hu no sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a wɔbɛnya afiri mu de ahwɛ wɔn ho ne wɔn abusuafoɔ	It is important to remember that because of the difficulties of their job, they believe that it is a job they can get out of to look after themselves and their families.
1483	But as of now, okadas and pragyas are a nuisance and we at the Daily Graphic believe that with education, regulation and enforcement of the appropriate regimes, the operators must be made to conform if it is established that the country cannot do without them.	Seesei ara okada ne pragya abɛyɛ ɔhaw ne ateetee na yɛn yɛwɔ Daily Graphic susu sɛ yɛma wɔn nteteeɛ ne yɛyɛ nhyehyɛeɛ a wɔbɛfa so aka afidie no a ɛbɛboa ama ɔman no akɔ so	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
1484	In reviewing the current law or system under which they operate, professional training, a licensing regime both for the rider and motorcycle/motor tricycles as well an insurance cover to cater for accidents will be most appropriate.	Wɔrehwɛ mmara a ɛma kwan ma wɔyɛ adwuma no, wɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛeɛ a ɛbɛhwɛ wɔn a wɔka afidie no sɛ akwanhyia biara ba mu a	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. While looking at the rules that allow them to work, they made a system to monitor those who speak foreign languages when any interference occurs.
1485	With such a system in place, it will be easier for the Ghana Police Service to enforce the law and also deal with unregistered motorbikes and motor tricycles as well as those involved in criminal activities.	Sɛ wɔde nhyehyɛeɛ no gu akwan mu a ɛbɛboa ama Ghana Polisifoɔ no ahyɛ mmara no kena na aboa ma wɔakye okada ne pragya a wɔde di krɔno no	If the plan is taken into account, it will help Ghana police enforce the law and help them catch the illegal weapons and drugs.
1486	Currently, Ghanaians are divided over the regularisation of these two major means of transport because of their advantages and disadvantages.	Mprɛmprɛn yi Ghanafoɔ pii no ara na wɔn adwene ayɛ wɔn ntata wɔ saa mmara yi ho esiane ɛho mfaso papa ne bɔne	Currently, many Ghanaians are hesitant to obey this law because of its benefits and disadvantages. If you cannot translate it, just say you don't know.
1487	The Daily Graphic believes that if we want to have decency on our roads and improve our transportation system, then we have to comprehensively hold the bull by the horn and address the problem now or never.	Daily Graphic gye di sɛ sɛ yɛpɛ sɛ mmara ne pɛrepɛreyɛ ba yɛn akwan so ne yɛn akɔneabadie mu nsɛm mu deɛ a ɛnneɛ ɛwɔ sɛ yɛsɔ yɛn mmɛn mu na yɛhwɛ ɔhaw yi mprɛmprɛn yi ara anaasɛ yɛnhwɛ koraa.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1488	I don’t recall a happier day in my recent memory in Ghana than last Friday, the Green Ghana day.	Menkae da biara m’ani gyee wɔ Ghana sɛ Fiada a atwa mu yi a na ɛyɛ Green Ghana da.	I never knew that the Ghanaian flag was a green flag.
1489	This was the day that we were all urged to go out and plant a tree.	Yei ne da a yɛn nyinaa ara bɔɔ mu kɔɔ abɔten sɛ yɛrekɔ dua dua.	This was the day we all went to the beach to go fishing.
1490	Since I came back to Ghana 20 years ago and to the realisation that the reality of our country was very different from what was in the Geography books, this was the most successful attempt at doing something to reverse the catastrophic degradation of our lands.	Mebaa Ghana mfeɛ aduonu atwa mu yi mahunu sɛ nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ yɛn man yi mu nea ɛwɔ asaase ho adesua nwoma mu no bɔ abira. Yei abɛyɛ nkunimdie dwumadie a yayɛ sɛ yɛ de bɔ yɛn nsaase a ɛresɛe ho ban.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. I came to Ghana twenty years ago to see that what is happening in our country is different from what is in the world's educational books. It has become a lesson to learn to protect our fragile environment.
1491	Five million seedlings were made available by the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for us to plant and there was a joyful atmosphere that I hadn’t noticed for a long time.	Nnuaba ɔpepem nnum na Nsaase ne Agudeɛ Asoeɛ no de maa yɛn sɛ yɛndua no de anigyeɛ a ebi so mmaaeɛ wɔ mmerɛ tenten mu na aba.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know
1492	It might well be that enough Ghanaians had noticed that the one thing that needed our attention more than anything else was the state of the land mass that we call Ghana.	Ghanafoɔ bɛhwɛ ahu a na adeɛ baako a ɛhia sɛ yɛte y'ani hwɛ sene bibiara aka paa ara ne yɛn nsaasetam teabea a yɛfrɛ no Ghana no.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know Ghanaians will see that one of the most important things we need to look out for is our country called Ghana.
1493	Far more than any potholed road, any dilapidated school, any hospital without beds or any schoolchildren without computers and I daresay, even the worst of any rampaging virus, what we should all get and remain agitated about is the state of our land, the land that had lost its forest cover, the rivers that are drying up, what used to be a wet month of May turning out hot and totally dry.	Adeɛ a ɛho hia sene akwan mu mmena, sukuu dan a atete, ayaresabea a nni mpa anaa sukuu nkwadaa nni abɛɛfo badwemma mfidie mpo no, merepae mu aka sɛ mpo yareɛ a ɛretrɛ no adeɛ baako a ɛwɔ sɛ yɛn nyinaa bo fu ho paa ne yɛn nsaase tebea, nsaase a ayera ne kwaeɛ, ne nsutene awe, sutɔberɛ Kɔtɔnima bosome a seisei ara abɛyɛ ɔhyew ne ɔpɛ.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1494	I haven’t taken a look at the Geography textbooks that are being used in our schools today, but I do know that the characteristics of the land mass of Ghana in the books I used at school certainly do not look like present day Ghana.	Menhwɛɛ asaase ho adesua nwoma a asuafoɔ resua wɔ sukuu mu nansei nanso mɛtumi aka sɛ sɛnea na Ghana nsaase teɛ berɛ a ne mekɔ sukuu no nte sɛ nnɛ Ghana.	I haven't read any geographic books in school yet but I can say that the way Ghana was when I was in school was not the same as it is today.
1495	We still talk about dense tropical forests, but that is not the reality of our lands.	Yɛgu so kasa fa kwaeɛ dodoɔ ho nanso nokwasɛm no sɛ nnyɛ sei na yɛn nsaase no teɛ	We talk about many things but the truth is that our surroundings are not as diverse as we thought.
1496	We still talk about wild animals but they had been hunted down and their habitats taken over long ago.	Yɛgu so kasa fa kwaeɛ mu mmoa ho nanso y'aku wɔn nyinaa ara agye watenabea abɔ so.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1497	The dense tropical forests and wild animals now exist only as part of our language and not part of our reality.	Kwaeɛ dodoɔ ne mu mmoa no abɛka yɛn kasa ho nanso nte saa ara koraa	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1498	Even what we thought were forest reserves have been shown to have been hollowed out in the search for gold and other minerals.	Mpo nea na yɛdwene sɛ ɛyɛ kwaeɛ a yɛmfa yɛn nsa nka no nyinaa ara yatu mu agudeɛ ne sika kɔkɔɔ nyinaa ara ama no asa.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1499	Maybe our reality got through to most of us and I am hoping that those who did not take part had very good reasons not to have done so.	Ebia yɛn nokwaredie	We may not know.
