257	WHO Report Says COVID Cases Decline, Except in Americas, Africa	Raporo ya OMS ivuga ko Imanza za COVID zigabanuka, Usibye muri Amerika, Afurika	The OMS report says that the number of COVID-19 cases has halved, except in the United States, Africa and Asia. If you cannot translate, just say you don't know.
258	The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the number of newly reported coronavirus cases and deaths globally continued to fall in the last week, continuing a decline that began in March.	Ku wa gatatu, Ishami ry'Umuryango w'Abibumbye ryita ku Buzima ryatangaje ko umubare w'abantu banduye coronavirus n'impfu zavuzwe ku isi wakomeje kugabanuka mu cyumweru gishize, bikomeza kugabanuka byatangiye muri Werurwe.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. On Tuesday, the United Nations Health Organization announced that the number of cases of coronavirus and deaths reported worldwide has continued to decline since March.
259	In its weekly report on the pandemic, the U.N. health agency said there were about 3.8 million new infections and more than 15,000 deaths last week, a 17% and 3% drop on the week respectively. But those figures are believed to be a significant underestimate of COVID-19's true toll as increasing numbers of countries abandon widespread testing and surveillance.	Muri raporo y’icyumweru ivuga ku cyorezo, ikigo cy’ubuzima cya Leta zunze ubumwe z’Amerika cyavuze ko mu cyumweru gishize hari abantu bashya bagera kuri miliyoni 3.8 n’impfu zirenga 15.000, icyumweru 17% na 3% bikagabanuka. Ariko iyo mibare ngo ni ugusuzugura cyane umubare wa COVID-19 kuko umubare w’ibihugu ugenda ureka kwipimisha no kugenzura.	In its latest weekly report on the coronavirus, the United States Health Department said that in the past week there were more than 3.7 million new cases and more than 15,000 deaths, down 17% and 3%. But the figures are a stark underestimate of the number of COVID-19 cases because the number of countries which stop testing and monitoring is increasing.
260	Still, WHO noted that cases rose by about a third in Africa and 13% in the Americas. There was also a nearly 70% jump in deaths reported in India, although that was attributed to delayed reporting rather than a recent surge of disease.	Ninde, OMS yavuze ko imanza ziyongereyeho kimwe cya gatatu muri Afurika na 13% muri Amerika. Habayeho kandi gusimbuka hafi 70% by'impfu zavuzwe mu Buhinde, nubwo ibyo byatewe no gutinda gutanga raporo aho kuba indwara ziherutse kwiyongera.	WHO says cases have risen by a third in Africa and 13% in the United States. There has also been a 70% increase in deaths reported in India, although this was due to a delay in reporting cases.
261	Last week, authorities in South Africa said they had noted an uptick in COVID-19 cases attributable to the BA.4 mutant of omicron, although they said it was too early to tell if that would result in a significant new wave of disease. Although the BA.4 version of COVID-19's omicron variant appears more infectious than omicron, WHO said there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death.	Mu cyumweru gishize, abategetsi bo muri Afurika yepfo bavuze ko babonye ikibazo cya COVID-19 cyatewe na BA.4 mutant ya omicron, nubwo bavuze ko hakiri kare kumenya niba ibyo byavamo indwara nshya. Nubwo verisiyo ya BA.4 ya COVID-19 ya omicron isa nkaho yanduye kurusha omicron, OMS yavuze ko nta kimenyetso cyerekana ko biganisha ku mubare munini w’ibitaro cyangwa urupfu.	Last week, South African governments announced a case of COVID-19 caused by the BA.4 mutant of omicron, although they said it was still too early to know if it would cause a new disease. Although the BA.4 mutant of omicron looks more likely to have caused the disease, the OMS said that there was no evidence of a significant increase in hospitalization or deaths.
262	"Salim Abdool Karim, a public health expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that while only a ""modest"" rise in cases had been noted, South Africa was also in the middle of a holiday period and testing had dropped significantly. He said the cases were slowing and were ""not following a rocket-like upward trajectory we would expect"" in another spike of disease."	"Salim Abdool Karim, impuguke mu buzima rusange muri kaminuza ya KwaZulu-Natal, yavuze ko mu gihe hagaragaye ubwiyongere bukabije mu manza, Afurika yepfo nayo yari mu kiruhuko kandi ikizamini cyaragabanutse cyane.

263	At a press briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said it was too soon to tell if COVID-19 was entering a seasonal pattern and warned against countries dropping all of their restrictions too quickly — as many in the West have done.	Ku wa gatatu, mu kiganiro n'abanyamakuru, umuyobozi mukuru w’ibihe bidasanzwe muri OMS, Dr. Michael Ryan, yavuze ko bidatinze kumenya niba COVID-19 yinjiye mu bihe by’ibihe kandi akanaburira ibihugu kureka ibyo bibuza byose - nk'uko benshi mu Burengerazuba babikoze.	Dr. Michael Ryan, in a press conference on Wednesday, said that it was not yet clear whether COVID-19 had entered a pandemic and urged countries to avoid all restrictions - just as many in the West did.
264	"""The jury is still out as to how seasonal this virus will become,"" he said, explaining that it wasn't proven yet that COVID-19 would naturally drop off in the summer and that the world could yet face more unsettling variants. ""If people are crowded together in conditions where a new variant is spreading, you will see high levels of transmission,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Inteko y'abacamanza iracyareba uko iyi virusi izagenda iba ibihe"", asobanura ko bitaragaragaye neza ko COVID-19 izagwa mu mpeshyi kandi ko isi ishobora guhura n'ibindi bintu bitesha umutwe. Ati: ""Niba abantu bateraniye hamwe mu bihe aho usanga ubundi buryo bushya bukwirakwira, uzabona ubwinshi bwo kwandura."""	"""The committee is still assessing the course of this virus,"" he said, adding that it is not clear whether the virus will die in the summer and that the world may face other uncertainties. ""If people are together in situations where a new spread of the virus is being created, you will see a lot of spread."""
265	Meanwhile in China, authorities continued to crack down on cities, including Beijing, where more than 10% of the subway system was shut down in an effort to curb the virus' spread, after authorities in the capital already closed down indoor dining, gyms and school classes.	Hagati aho, mu Bushinwa, abayobozi bakomeje guhashya imijyi, harimo na Beijing, aho abantu barenga 10% bya sisitemu ya metero zafunzwe mu rwego rwo gukumira virusi ikwirakwizwa, nyuma y’uko abayobozi mu murwa mukuru bamaze gufunga ibyokurya byo mu ngo, siporo ndetse amasomo y'ishuri.	In China, authorities are continuing to crack down on cities, including Beijing, where more than 10% of the meter system has been closed to prevent the spread of the virus, after the city authorities had closed down restaurants, sports and school courses.
266	In Shanghai, rigid and widely derided restrictions have led to shortages of food and medical aid along with a wider — though likely temporary — impact on the national economy. Desperate, outraged citizens have confronted authorities at barricades and online, screamed out of their windows and banged pots and pans in a sign of frustration and anger.	Muri Shanghai, imbogamizi zikomeye kandi zisebya abantu benshi zatumye ibura ry'ibiribwa n'inkunga z'ubuvuzi hamwe n’ingaruka nini nubwo zishobora kuba iz'igihe gito - ku bukungu bw'igihugu.

Today, the ISNA news agency reported that Iran's authorities announced that they would execute the execution of Ahmad Reza Jalali by the end of May.
290	Jalali, a researcher and physician who specializes in disaster relief, was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016.

292	Iran does not recognize dual nationals.	Irani ntiyemera abenegihugu babiri.	Iran does not believe in two nationalities.
293	The announcement came as authorities in Stockholm wrapped up the trial of Hamid Nouri, a former Iranian prosecution official whom Swedish officials arrested in November 2019.	Ibi byatangajwe mu gihe abayobozi i Stockholm bashoje urubanza rwa Hamid Nouri wahoze ari umushinjacyaha wa Irani, abayobozi ba Suwede bata muri yombi mu Gushyingo 2019.	It was announced during the conclusion of the trial of former Iranian prosecutor Hamid Nouri, who was arrested in Sweden in November 2019.
294	Authorities say Nouri played a role in the deaths of political prisoners executed on Iranian government orders at Irans Gohardasht prison during the final phase of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. Nouri has been held in custody in Sweden since his arrest.	Abayobozi bavuga ko Nouri yagize uruhare mu rupfu rw’imfungwa za politiki ziciwe ku itegeko rya guverinoma ya Irani muri gereza ya Irans Gohardasht mu cyiciro cya nyuma cy’intambara ya Irani na Iraki mu 1988.

"Human Rights Watch, in its recent report, said: ""Iran is one of the world's most ruthless countries."""
298	If Nouri is convicted, he will face a maximum life sentence on charges of international war crimes and human rights abuses. Iran recently summoned the Swedish envoy in protest over Nouris case.

If Nouri is convicted, he will be sentenced to life in prison for international war crimes and human rights violations. Iran has recently called a Swedish envoy to protest the case of Nouris.
299	Maja Aberg, senior policy adviser with Amnesty International Sweden, says it is no coincidence that Iran announced Jalalis pending execution just after Swedish prosecutors moved on Nouris trial.	Maja Aberg, umujyanama mukuru muri politiki muri Amnesty International Suwede, avuga ko bidahwitse ko Irani yatangaje Jalalis mu gihe hagitegerejwe kwicwa nyuma yuko abashinjacyaha ba Suwede bimukiye mu rubanza rwa Nouris.	Maja Aberg, a senior policy adviser at Amnesty International Sweden, says it is unlikely that Iran would have announced that Jalalis was being killed while he was being treated for execution after the Swedish judges returned to the Nouris case.

307	"""President Erdogan has good relations with the king; with the crown prince Muhammad Bin Salman, we had serious difficulties,"" said Ogutcu.

And things are changing and getting worse, and now at the level of the president, it is going to be a badge."
308	Erdogan and the crown prince have been bitter rivals. The Turkish president led international condemnation over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul.	Erdogan n'umutware w'ikamba babaye abanywanyi bakaze. Perezida wa Turkiya yamaganye amahanga kubera iyicwa ry'umunyamakuru wa Arabiya Sawudite, Jamal Khashoggi, yiciwe muri konsuline ya Arabiya Sawudite i Istanbul.	Erdogan and the king have been close friends. The Turkish president has denounced the international community for the killing of the Arab journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
309	The killing was linked to the crown prince, a charge he denied. But the decision earlier this month to move the Khashoggi murder trial from Istanbul to Riyadh is seen as a gesture by Ankara, opening the way for Erdogan's visit.	Ubwicanyi bwari bufitanye isano nigikomangoma, ikirego arabihakana. Ariko icyemezo cyatangiye muri uku kwezi cyo kwimura urubanza rw’ubwicanyi rwa Khashoggi kuva Istambul kugera i Riyadh gifatwa nk’ikimenyetso cya Ankara, kikaba cyarafunguye inzira y'uruzinduko rwa Erdogan.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know The murder was linked to the king, the charge was denied. However, the decision to move the murder trial of Khashoggi from Istanbul to Riyadh is viewed as Ankara's sign, which opened the way for Erdogan's visit.
310	Ogutcu says with presidential elections due next year, Erdogan is looking for Saudi help to bail out the ailing Turkish economy.	Ogutcu avuga ko hamwe n'amatora ya perezida ateganijwe umwaka utaha, Erdogan arimo gushaka ubufasha bwa Arabiya Sawudite kugira ngo akize ubukungu bwa Turukiya burwaye.	Ogutcu said that Erdogan is seeking assistance from Saudi Arabia to help Turkey's economy recover.
311	"""Turkey has an interest in reviving relations with Riyadh because Turkey needs financial support,"" said Ogutcu.

312	Shared concerns over Iran's growing influence in the region -- along with its nuclear energy program -- provide important common ground between Riyadh and Ankara, says international relations professor Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University, especially as American attention is expected to pivot away from the Middle East and toward China.	Umwarimu w’umubano mpuzamahanga, Soli Ozel wo muri kaminuza ya Kadir Has ya kaminuza ya Istanbul, avuga ko impungenge z’uko Irani igenda yiyongera muri kariya karere - hamwe na gahunda yayo y’ingufu za kirimbuzi - bitanga icyerekezo rusange hagati ya Riyadh na Ankara.

313	"""Turkey does propose itself as a counterweight to Iran. Both countries have an interest along with all the western countries for Iran not to be as influential throughout the region as it is today,"" said Ozel.

""And the Iranians also always send signals that they don't want others to remove them from these countries - Iraq, Lebanon and Siria - where they have a large influence."""
314	Erdogan's Saudi visit is part of a wider policy of seeking to repair relations across the region in a bid to end its isolation. The Turkish president has recently visited the United Arab Emirates and earlier this month hosted the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog.

315	But analyst Ozel warns Ankara is in a vulnerable position.	Ariko umusesenguzi Ozel aragabisha Ankara ari mu bihe bigoye.	But the failure of Ozel threatens Ankara in difficult times.
316	"""Turkey alienated, insulted, offended a lot of countries with which it had at least decent relations. And they all recognize that this burst of diplomacy is coming out of weakness rather than strength,"" said Ozel."	"Ozel yagize ati: ""Turukiya yitandukanyije, iratukwa, ibabaza ibihugu byinshi byari bifitanye nibura n'imibanire myiza.

"Ozel said: ""Turkey has separated, broken up, and shocked many countries that had at least a good relationship with it. And everybody agrees that this shift in diplomacy is a weakness rather than a strength."""
317	But analysts say Ankara is banking on its importance as a potential bulwark to Iranian ambitions, a factor that may help overcome any remaining hostility among the neighbors it is trying to win back.	Ariko abasesenguzi bavuga ko Ankara ari banki ku kamaro kayo nk’igihome gikomeye cyo kwifuza kwa Irani, kikaba ari ikintu gishobora gufasha gutsinda inzangano zisigaye mu baturanyi igerageza gutsinda.	But analysts say Ankara is a bank on its importance as a strong shelter for Iran's desire, which could help to overcome the remaining divisions between neighbors that it is trying to overcome.
318	Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms	Iyicwa, Gufungwa bamanitse Kuvugurura Amategeko yo muri Arabiya Sawudite	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
319	Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change.	Arabiya Sawudite irihatira kuvugurura imikorere y’ubutabera ikarishye ariko ivugurura rirengerwa n’iyicwa ndetse n’ifatwa rikomeye ry’abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi, bitera kwibaza niba byinshi bizahinduka.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
320	The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system.	Ubwami buzwiho gusobanura byimazeyo amategeko ya shariya ya kisilamu, agize ishingiro ryubucamanza.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
321	But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East.	Ariko mu mezi ashize yateye imbere hamwe n'ivugurura abasesenguzi bavuga ko rishobora gutuma inkiko zayo zikora nk'abandi bo mu burasirazuba bwo hagati.	But in the past few months, it has developed and opened up, according to analysts, which could allow its courts to work like those in the Middle East.
322	That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences.	Iyo mbaraga ishingiye ku ruhererekane rw'amategeko mashya ku bibazo byoroshye nk'uburenganzira bwo gutandukana kw'abagore n'ububasha bw'abacamanza bwo kumenya ibihano.	This effort is based on a series of new laws on simple issues such as the right to divorce and the ability of judges to know the penalty.
323	Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image.	Byatangajwe umwaka ushize n’umutegetsi w’ikirenga, igikomangoma, Mohammed bin Salman, ingamba, harimo n’igitabo cya mbere cy’amategeko ahana, bigaragara ko zihuye n’intego ya Arabiya Sawudite yo gukingura isi no koroshya isura y’intagondwa.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. It was announced last year by the highest official, King Mohammed bin Salman, a series of measures, including the first constitutional act, appear to be aligned with the Arab Saudi goal of covering the world and easing the appearance of the militants.
324	Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases.	Ndetse n'abanenga bemeza ko impinduka zishobora gutuma inkiko zo muri Arabiya Sawudite zishobora guhanurwa, mu bihe bimwe na bimwe.	Even those who oppose it believe that changes could lead to a delay in the execution of the Islamic courts in Saudi Arabia.
325	But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government.	Ariko ntawiteze ko kubuza kuvuga mu bwisanzure bizoroha, cyangwa se ko amategeko azafata neza abatavuga rumwe na leta.	But no one expects that blocking freedom of speech will be easy, or that the law will be able to adequately protect those who are against the government.
326	"And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to ""terrorism."""

328	Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion.	Amategeko abiri mashya yamaze kwemezwa na Guverinoma ya Arabiya Sawudite. Umuntu agenga iyakirwa ryibimenyetso, mbere kubushake bwabacamanza.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know Two new laws have been passed by the Islamic government of Saudi Arabia. A person controls the admission of evidence, first by the consent of the court.
329	The second, a family law, is to take effect in June. In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children.	Iya kabiri, amategeko yumuryango, agomba gukurikizwa muri kamena. Muri gahunda gakondo yiganjemo abagabo, yagura uburenganzira bwabagore bahukanye kubatunga no kurera abana babo.	Second, family laws, must be enforced in July. In the traditional system, which was mainly based on men, it guaranteed the right of husbands to provide for their children and to care for their children.
330	"Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented ""a major qualitative leap"" for women's rights and ""family stability."""	"Mu kwezi kwa Werurwe, igikomangoma Mohammed yatangaje iryo tegeko rishya, yavuze ko rihagarariye ""gusimbuka ubuziranenge"" ku burenganzira bw'umugore no ""gutekana mu muryango."""	"In March, King Mohammed announced the new law, saying it represents ""a breakthrough"" in the rights of women and ""a reconciliation in the family."""
331	The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights.	Adel al-Saeed, visi perezida w’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi ushinzwe uburenganzira bwa muntu, Adel al-Saeed yavuze ko iryo vugurura risa nkaho ryita ku masosiyete y’amahanga ashora imari mu bwami.

"""The investors are afraid to invest in this country, which is known for its laws, so these laws are designed to change the face of the country."""
333	The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes.	Igitabo gishya cy'amategeko ahana, kitarashyirwa ahagaragara, gishobora kuzana izindi mpinduka zikomeye.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The new laws, which are still not published, can bring about further changes.
334	Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases.	Muri shariya, ubuhakanyi, ubujura, kwigomeka, ubujura bwitwaje intwaro, gusambana, kunywa inzoga no gusebanya bitwara ibihano byateganijwe. Abacamanza basigaye bagena ibihano mu zindi manza.	In Syria, lying, stealing, arson, armed robbery, sex, drinking and lying are punished. The judges sometimes determine punishments in other cases.
335	"With a penal code in place, ""the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state,"" said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University."	"Hamwe n’amategeko ahana, ""leta izateganya ko abacamanza batashingira ku mahugurwa yabo bwite muri shariya ahubwo bakurikiza amategeko (ashingiye kuri shariya) yemejwe na leta"", ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Nathan Brown, umunyeshuri muri kaminuza ya George Washington."	"With the laws, ""the state will ensure that judges do not rely on their own scholarships in Syria but abide by the laws (based on Syria) established by the state,"" said Nathan Brown, a student at George Washington University."
336	"""As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region,"" said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms."	"Brown wize ku ivugurura rya Arabiya Sawudite yagize ati: ""Kubera iyo mpamvu, Arabiya Sawudite izasa cyane na gahunda y’amategeko mbonezamubano, kimwe na Leta nyinshi zo mu karere."""	"""That's why, because of this, Saudi Arabia will be very closely related to the bilateral border laws, just like many other countries in the region."""

"But he added that obeying the laws of the kingdom ""causes a big problem: loss of independence""."
339	The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal.	Umwami ni umuyobozi wubutabera bwa Arabiya Sawudite kandi akora nkurukiko rwa nyuma rwubujurire.	The king is the head of the judiciary of Saudi Arabia and serves as the last judge.
340	Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar.

He is one of many people being held in prison to try to deter dissenters and those who could challenge the government of Mohammed Mursi.

One of the most famous examples is the former king of Oman, Mohammed bin Nayef, a CIA advisor who is recognized in the West for his efforts to fight terrorism, but the king Salman took him out of the ring.

534	US Quietly Expands Asylum Limits While Preparing to End Them	Amerika Yaguye Bituje Imipaka Yubuhunzi Mugihe Yitegura Kubarangiza	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
535	The Biden administration has begun expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans to Mexico under pandemic-related powers to deny migrants a chance to seek asylum, expanding use of the rule even as it publicly says it has been trying to unwind it, officials said Wednesday.	Ku wa gatatu, abayobozi bavuze ko ubuyobozi bwa Biden bwatangiye kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa muri Mexico kubera ububasha bujyanye n’icyorezo bwo kwima abimukira amahirwe yo gusaba ubuhungiro, kwagura ikoreshwa ry’iryo tegeko nubwo rivuga ku mugaragaro ko ryagerageje kubireka.	Officials said on Wednesday that the administration of Biden began to remove citizens from Nicaragua and Nicaragua because of the authority to deny asylum, extending the use of the law even though it says it has tried to stop it.
536	The U.S. struck agreement with Mexico to expel up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans a day from three locations: San Diego; El Paso, Texas; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the effort.	Amerika yagiranye amasezerano na Mexico yo kwirukana abanya Cuba 100 na Nikaragwa 20 kumunsi ahantu hatatu: San Diego; El Paso, muri Texas; n'ikibaya cya Rio Grande, muri Texas, nk'uko byatangajwe n'umuyobozi wa Amerika ufite ubumenyi butaziguye bw'imbaraga.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
537	The expulsions began April 27 and will end May 22, the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.	Iyirukanwa ryatangiye ku ya 27 Mata rikazarangira ku ya 22 Gicurasi, nk'uko uyu muyobozi yabitangarije ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika kugira ngo atamenyekana kubera ko ayo masezerano atashyizwe ahagaragara.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
538	They are carried out under Title 42 authority, a public health law that has been used to expel migrants on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19. Title 42 is due to expire May 23, unless a judge intervenes.	Bikorerwa munsi yumutwe wa 42, itegeko ryubuzima rusange ryakoreshejwe mu kwirukana abimukira ku mpamvu zo gukumira ikwirakwizwa rya COVID-19. Umutwe wa 42 ugomba kurangira ku ya 23 Gicurasi, keretse umucamanza abigizemo uruhare.	It is under Article 42, which is the basic health law used to quarantine migrants for the purpose of preventing the spread of COVID-19. Article 42 must end on May 23, unless a court has acted in favour of it.
539	The U.S. and Mexico agreed April 26 to a very limited number of expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans, according to a high-level Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.	Nk’uko byatangajwe n'umuyobozi wo mu rwego rwo hejuru wo muri Megizike wavuze ko atigeze atangazwa kubera ko batemerewe kugira icyo batangaza ku mugaragaro, Amerika na Mexico byumvikanye ku ya 26 Mata ku mubare muto cyane wo kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa.	According to a top official of Mexico who said he did not know because he was not allowed to speak publicly, the United States and Mexico agreed on a very small number of border borders.
540	It was prompted by higher numbers of migrants from those two countries coming to the U.S. border.	Byatewe numubare munini w’abimukira bava muri ibyo bihugu byombi baza kumupaka wa Amerika.	It was due to a large number of immigrants from both countries coming to the US border.
541	Mexico also took into account that the U.S. government had started processing visas in Cuba again, the official said. Mexico had also begun processing visas for Cubans.	Uyu muyobozi yavuze ko Mexico kandi yazirikanye ko guverinoma y'Amerika yatangiye gutunganya viza muri Cuba. Mexico nayo yari yatangiye gutunganya viza kubanya Cuba.	The official also said that Mexico would not be able to recognize that the United States started issuing visa to Cuba. Mexico already started issuing visa to Cuba.
542	Another Mexican official, also not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans were being expelled from San Diego under Title 42.	Undi muyobozi wo muri Megizike, na we utemerewe kugira icyo atangaza ku mugaragaro, yemeje ko Abanyakanani bagera kuri 100 na Nikaragwa 20 birukanwa muri San Diego ku mutwe wa 42.	A third official, who is not allowed to speak publicly, confirmed that 100 Canadians and 20 Nikaragwa were deported from San Diego on the 42nd Street.
543	The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	Minisiteri ishinzwe umutekano mu gihugu cya Amerika ntabwo yahise isubiza icyifuzo cyo gutanga ibisobanuro.	The United States Ministry of Defense did not respond to the request for clarification.
544	Until last week, Mexico only agreed to take Guatemalans, Hondurans and El Salvadorans — in addition to Mexicans — under Title 42 authority. Other nationalities are subject to Title 42 but costs, strained diplomatic ties and other considerations often make it difficult to send them back to their home countries.	Kugeza mu cyumweru gishize, Mexico yemeye gufata Guatemala, Hondurans na El Salvadorans - usibye Abanyamegizike - ku butegetsi bwa 42. Abandi benegihugu bagengwa na Umutwe wa 42 ariko ikiguzi, umubano wububanyi n’ububanyi n’ibindi bitekerezo akenshi biragoye kubasubiza mu bihugu byabo.	Since last week, Mexico has agreed to take Guatemala, Hondurans and El Salvadorans - except the Mexicans - under the 42nd Executive. Other citizens are subject to the 42nd Executive but the cost, friendship and friendship often make it difficult to return them to their countries.
545	It's next to impossible for the U.S. to expel migrants to Cuba or Nicaragua because of poor relations with those governments. 	Bikurikira ntibishoboka ko Amerika yirukana abimukira muri Cuba cyangwa Nikaragwa kubera umubano mubi na guverinoma.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
546	That has posed a challenge for the Biden administration as more people from those countries seek haven in the United States.	Ibyo byateje ikibazo ubuyobozi bwa Biden mugihe abantu benshi baturuka muri ibyo bihugu bashaka ubuhungiro muri Amerika.	This has caused problems to Biden's administration because many people from these countries are seeking asylum in the United States.
547	Cubans were stopped by U.S. authorities more than 32,000 times on the Mexican border in March, double the number in February and more than five times October's count, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Nicaragua eased travel restrictions from Cuba in November, making it easier for Cubans to continue by land to the U.S. border. Most enter the U.S. in or near Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas.	Nk’uko byatangajwe na gasutamo ya Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, ngo abanya Cuba bahagaritswe n'abayobozi b'Abanyamerika inshuro zirenga 32.000 ku mupaka wa Mexico, bakubye kabiri muri Gashyantare ndetse bakubye inshuro zirenga eshanu Ukwakira. Nikaragwa yorohereje imbogamizi z’ingendo ziva muri Cuba mu Gushyingo, byorohereza Abanyakanada gukomeza ku butaka kugera ku mupaka wa Amerika. Benshi binjira muri Amerika cyangwa hafi ya Yuma, Arizona, na Del Rio, Texas.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know
548	Nicaraguans were stopped more than 16,000 times in March, more than double September's level. The vast majority enter in South Texas.	Muri Werurwe, Nikaragwa yahagaritswe inshuro zirenga 16.000, irenga inshuro ebyiri Nzeri. Umubare munini winjira muri Texas yepfo.	In March, Nikaragwa was blocked more than 16.000 times, more than twice in September. The majority of them entered the southern Texas.
549	Lifting Title 42 has proved controversial as midterm elections near, even for Biden's Democratic Party, amid concerns that the U.S. is unprepared for an anticipated increase in migrants seeking asylum. Authorities stopped migrants more than 221,000 times in March, the highest mark in 22 years.	Kuzamura Umutwe wa 42 byagaragaye ko bitavugwaho rumwe nk’amatora yo hagati, ndetse no mu ishyaka rya demokarasi rya Biden, mu gihe hari impungenge z’uko Amerika ititeguye kwiyongera kw’abimukira bashaka ubuhungiro. Muri Werurwe, abategetsi bahagaritse abimukira inshuro zirenga 221.000, kikaba aricyo kintu kinini mu myaka 22.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
550	The White House and Homeland Security Department have publicly stood behind the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to end the measure because it could no longer be justified on grounds of protecting public health.	Ishami ry’umutekano n’umutekano mu gihugu ryashyigikiye ku mugaragaro icyemezo cy’ikigo gishinzwe kurwanya no gukumira indwara cyo guhagarika iki cyemezo kuko kitagishoboye kuba gifite ishingiro kubera kurengera ubuzima rusange.	The National Security and Defense Committee supported the decision of the CDC to suspend this measure because it could not be justified because of the safety of the public.
551	But the practice of expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans runs counter to the administration's public statements that it was phasing out use of the pandemic powers to prepare for May 23.	Ariko imyitozo yo kwirukana abanya Cuba na Nikaragwa irahabanye n’ubuyobozi bwatangaje ko bwagiye bukuraho imbaraga z’icyorezo kugira ngo bitegure ku ya 23 Gicurasi.	But the exercises for the removal of Cubans and Nikaragwa have been interrupted by the government which announced that it had reduced its capacity to prepare for May 23.
552	The U.S. has expelled migrants more than 1.8 million times under Title 42 authority since March 2020, effectively overriding rights to seek asylum under U.S. law and international treaty. In doing so, migrants are not subject to immigration law, which include rights to seek protection from persecution at home.	Kuva muri Werurwe 2020, Amerika yirukanye abimukira inshuro zirenga miliyoni 1.8 ku butegetsi bwa Umutwe wa 42, bivuguruza uburenganzira bwo gusaba ubuhungiro hakurikijwe amategeko ya Amerika n'amasezerano mpuzamahanga. Mu kubikora, abimukira ntibagengwa n'amategeko y’abinjira, akubiyemo uburenganzira bwo kurindwa ibitotezo mu ngo.	Since March 2020, the United States has deported more than 1.8 million immigrants under the 42nd President, changing the right to seek asylum under the United States and international agreements. In doing so, immigrants are not subject to the immigration laws, including the right to be protected from abuse in their homes.
553	The administration said in court filings that it began processing more Central American adults under immigration laws after the CDC's announcement on April 1. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that it couldn't start unwinding Title 42 while it was still in effect.	Ubuyobozi bwatangaje mu rukiko ko bwatangiye gutunganya abantu benshi bakuze bo muri Amerika yo Hagati bakurikiza amategeko y’abinjira nyuma y’uko CDC ibitangaza ku ya 1 Mata.	The government announced in court that it began to quarantine many older adults in Central America who had been following the CDC's announcement on April 1.
554	U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays strongly criticized the CDC's decision, suggesting he would try to keep Title 42 in effect after May 23. A hearing is scheduled May 13 for oral arguments.	Umucamanza w'akarere ka Amerika, Robert Summerhays, yanenze cyane icyemezo cya CDC, avuga ko azagerageza gukomeza Umutwe wa 42 nyuma y'itariki ya 23 Gicurasi.	The US District Attorney Robert Summerhays, harshly criticized the decision by the CDC, saying he would try to extend the 42nd Session after May 23.
555	Marisa Limon, senior director of advocacy and planning at the Hope Border Institute, said advocates began learning about expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans from El Paso on Monday and later confirmed the new practice with U.S. officials.	Umuyobozi mukuru ushinzwe ubuvugizi n’igenamigambi mu kigo cya Hope Border, Marisa Limon, yavuze ko abunganizi batangiye kwiga ibijyanye no kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa muri El Paso ku wa mbere nyuma baza kwemeza imikorere mishya hamwe n’abayobozi ba Amerika.	The head of advocacy and planning at Hope Border, Marisa Limon, said experts began to study the removal of the Native Americans and Nikaragwa from El Paso on Monday and approved the new procedures with American officials.
556	"Limon said the administration is ""trying to get every last bit out of Title 42"" before it expires. "	"Limon yavuze ko ubuyobozi ""bugerageza gukuramo buri kintu cya nyuma mu mutwe wa 42"" kitararangira."	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
557	"She called it ""sobering"" but consistent with the administration's efforts to have other countries in the Western hemisphere take more responsibility for hosting people fleeing their homes."

"He called it ""thinking"" but he connected it with the power of government to help other nations in the eastern part of the world take a significant role in housing refugees."
558	Mexico Relocates Migrant Camp; Haitians Appear at Border	Mexico yimuye inkambi y'abimukira; Abanyahayitiya bagaragara kumupaka	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
559	Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have relocated a migrant camp that sprung up in a park in the border city of Reynosa, moving about 2,000 people from Central America and Haiti to a shelter in the city, across the border from McAllen, Texas.	Ku wa kabiri, abategetsi ba Mexico bavuze ko bimuye inkambi y’abimukira yavukiye muri parike iri mu mujyi wa Reynosa uhana imbibi, yimura abantu bagera ku 2000 bava muri Amerika yo Hagati na Haiti mu buhungiro mu mujyi, hakurya y’umupaka na McAllen, muri Texas.	When they moved the refugee camp in the border town of Reynosa, Mexico, on Tuesday, the government announced that it had moved a refugee camp which was built in the border town of Reynosa, which is bordered by the US and Haiti, moving a total of 2000 people from Central America and Haiti to the city, which is bordered by McAllen, Texas.
560	The camp of migrants mainly from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti sprung up after U.S. officials, citing the pandemic, invoked a health rule that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum.	Inkambi y'abimukira ahanini baturutse muri Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras na Haiti imaze kuvuka nyuma yuko abayobozi ba Amerika, bavuga ko iki cyorezo, basabye itegeko ry’ubuzima ryanga abimukira amahirwe yo gusaba ubuhungiro.

If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Mexico announced that migrants were taken to a refugee camp on Monday night, saying it would provide safety and good service.
562	But on Monday, people in another border city, Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of migrants, mainly Haitians, have streamed into that city, which is across the border from Laredo, Texas	Ariko ku wa mbere, abantu bo mu wundi mujyi uhana imbibi, Nuevo Laredo, bavuze ko abimukira babarirwa mu magana, cyane cyane Abanyahayiti, binjiye muri uwo mujyi, uhana imbibi na Laredo, muri Texas.	But on Monday, Nuevo Laredo residents said that hundreds of immigrants, mostly Greeks, had entered the city, bordering Laredo, Texas.
563	The rush apparently started after the U.S. began processing some asylum-seekers there.	Kwihuta bigaragara ko byatangiye nyuma yuko Amerika itangiye gutunganya bamwe mubasaba ubuhungiro.	It seems that the rapid spread began after the United States began to prepare some asylum seekers.
564	The Catholic bishop of Nuevo Laredo said Monday that migrant shelters there are overcrowded, with some migrants sleeping outside in tents.	Umwepiskopi gatolika wa Nuevo Laredo yavuze ku wa mbere ko aho abimukira bahurira huzuye, aho abimukira bamwe baryama hanze mu mahema.	The Catholic bishop of Nuevo Laredo said on Monday that the refugee camp was filled, where some refugees slept in tents.
565	Bishop Enrique Sánchez Martínez said migrants started streaming into Nuevo Laredo in late April, though the city isn't usually popular among migrants, in part because it is dominated by the violent Northeast drug cartel.	Musenyeri Enrique Sánchez Martínez yavuze ko abimukira batangiye kwinjira muri Nuevo Laredo mu mpera za Mata, nubwo uyu mujyi udakunzwe cyane n'abimukira, kubera ko wiganjemo amakarito y’ibiyobyabwenge yo mu majyaruguru y'uburasirazuba.	Enrique Sánchez Martínez said that immigrants began to enter Nuevo Laredo in the end of April, although this city is not popular with immigrants, because it is filled with drug trafficking gangs from the northeast.
566	"""It is new for us because this is the last place they come, due to the conditions of our border, of our city, which are sometimes adverse for migrants,"" the bishop said. "	"Umwepiskopi yagize ati: ""Ni shyashya kuri twe kuko aha niho hantu ha nyuma baza, bitewe n'imipaka yacu, umujyi wacu, rimwe na rimwe bikaba bibi ku bimukira."""	"The bishop said: ""This is a new place for us, because this is the last place to come, because our borders, our city, sometimes are dangerous for immigrants."""
567	"""But since they opened the door in the United States to asylum requests, a lot of them came in large groups."""	"""Ariko kuva bafungura umuryango muri Amerika gusaba ubuhunzi, benshi muri bo baza mu matsinda manini."""	"""But since they opened a family in America to ask for asylum, many of them came into large groups."""
568	Marvin Ajic, the director of the Casa Nazareth shelter, said that around April 16, Mexican authorities notified the shelters that the United States would resume processing asylum claims for humanitarian reasons.	Umuyobozi w'ikigo cya Casa Nazareth, Marvin Ajic, yavuze ko ahagana ku ya 16 Mata, abategetsi ba Mexico bamenyesheje ubwo buhungiro ko Amerika izakomeza gutunganya ibirego by'ubuhunzi kubera impamvu z’ubutabazi.	The director of Casa Nazareth, Marvin Ajic, said that on April 16, the Mexican government told the asylum that the United States would continue to investigate the case for humanitarian reasons.
569	The U.S. had begun allowing more people in, especially Central American adults, to prepare for lifting Title 42 — a pandemic-era health rule that denies migrants a chance to enter the U.S. seek asylum — on May 23. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that the government could not unwind the rule before the end date.	Ku ya 23 Gicurasi, Amerika yari yatangiye kwemerera abantu benshi, cyane cyane abakuze bo muri Amerika yo Hagati, kwitegura gukuraho Umutwe wa 42 - itegeko ry’ubuzima bwo mu gihe cy’icyorezo kibuza abimukira amahirwe yo kwinjira muri Amerika gusaba ubuhungiro - ku ya 23 Gicurasi. Ariko umucamanza wa federasiyo muri Louisiana yemeje icyumweru gishize ko guverinoma idashobora gukuraho iryo tegeko mbere yitariki yo kurangiriraho.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know On May 23, the United States began to allow a number of people, especially elderly Americans, to prepare to withdraw the 42nd Article - a health law that blocks refugees from entering the United States to seek asylum - on May 23. A federal judge in Louisiana approved the amendment last week.
570	"""The (Mexican) immigration officials organized things with the shelters, and the plan was to send people who had been waiting a long time, without any checks, basically anyone,"" Ajic said."	"Ajic yagize ati: ""Abashinzwe abinjira n'abasohoka (Abanyamegizike) bateguye ibintu hamwe n'ubuhungiro, kandi gahunda yari iyo kohereza abantu bari bategereje igihe kirekire, nta sheki bafite, cyane cyane umuntu uwo ari we wese."""	"Ajic said: ""The immigration authorities (Egyptians) had prepared things and a quarantine, and the plan was to send people who had been waiting for a long time, without a passport, particularly anyone."""
571	That apparently drew the attention of other migrants, including Haitians.	Ikigaragara ni uko ibyo byashimishije abandi bimukira, harimo n'Abanyahayiti.	It is clear that this inspired other immigrants, including the Hebrews.
572	In September, similar rumors sparked a rush by about 15,000 mostly Haitian refugees to the Texas border, where they camped under a bridge. U.S. officials began large scale deportations of Haitians while also allowing thousands to remain in the U.S.	Muri Nzeri, ibihuha nk'ibyo byatumye abantu bagera ku 15.000 bihutira cyane cyane impunzi zo muri Hayiti kugera ku mupaka wa Texas, aho bakambitse munsi y'ikiraro. Abayobozi ba Amerika batangiye kwirukana Abanyahayiti benshi mu gihe banemerera ibihumbi kuguma muri Amerika	In September, such rumors led to 15,000 people rushing to the US-Mexico border, especially Haitians, where they stuck under the bridge. The Americans began to deport many Haitians while thousands of them agreed to stay in the US.
573	Ajic warned migrants against coming to the border, noting the risks. On Monday, Mexico's National Immigration Institute said that so far this year, it has pulled the bodies of 19 immigrants from the Rio Grande, also known as the Rio Bravo.	Ajic yihanangirije abimukira kwirinda kuza ku mupaka, avuga ingaruka. Ku wa mbere, Ikigo cy’igihugu gishinzwe abinjira n’abasohoka muri Mexico cyavuze ko kugeza uyu mwaka, kimaze gukuramo imirambo y’abimukira 19 bava muri Rio Grande, izwi kandi ku izina rya Rio Bravo.	Ajic warned refugees not to cross the border, saying they would have consequences. On Monday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Mexico said that to date, it has retrieved 19 bodies from Rio Grande, also known as Rio Bravo.

622	The report notes that the military dominates public life and there is little open criticism of the government, either in the media or by opposition figures. The Rwanda government argues that allowing a range of opinions would be dangerous in a country struggling to come to terms with its bloody past.	Raporo ivuga ko igisirikare cyiganje mu buzima rusange kandi ko nta kunegura guverinoma, haba mu bitangazamakuru cyangwa ku bantu batavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi.

624	"""Opponents to the regime have to flee the country or to join in rebel movements outside the country or in the Congo and no chance to express a different view,"" he says. ""All the good policies that the government has been implementing - including the organization of the elections, national elections, presidential and parliamentary, in 2003 - will lack the credibility because they were not implemented in an environment that actually allowed a fair contest to take place,"" he says."	"Agira ati: ""Abatavuga rumwe n'ubutegetsi bagomba guhunga igihugu cyangwa kujya mu myigaragambyo y'inyeshyamba hanze y'igihugu cyangwa muri Kongo kandi nta mahirwe yo kuvuga ukundi.""

688	Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty	Raporo: Inganda zishobora kuvana ibihugu bikennye mubukene	Report: Companies can help nations in need to get out of poverty
689	A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies.	Raporo nshya y’umuryango w’abibumbye irasaba ibihugu bikennye cyane ku isi kuva mu bikorwa bito bikagera ku musaruro mwinshi kugira ngo ubukungu bwiyongere.	The new United Nations report calls for the world's most impoverished countries to move from small steps to large ones to increase economic growth.
690	"In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD — the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development — says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the ""poverty trap,"" which is stunting economic growth and development."	"Muri raporo y’ibihugu byateye imbere cyane cyane, UNCTAD - Inama y’umuryango w’abibumbye ishinzwe ubucuruzi n’iterambere - ivuga ko ibyo bihugu bigomba guhindura imiterere y’ubukungu kugira ngo bikure mu ""mutego w’ubukene,"" bidindiza iterambere ry’ubukungu n’iterambere."	"In its report on the most developed countries, UNCTAD - the United Nations Committee on Trade and Development - says that these countries must change their economic structure to avoid the ""trap of poverty,"" which hinders economic and social development."
691	"Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers ""Least Developed Countries"" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015."	"Mu bihugu 48 Umuryango w'abibumbye ufata ""Ibihugu byateye imbere cyane"" (LDCs), kimwe gusa, Laos, kiri mu nzira zo kugera ku ntego zirindwi z'ikinyagihumbi (MDG) muri 2015."	"If you can't translate simply say you don't know.

692	Only four African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda — are likely to meet a majority of these targets.	Ibihugu bine bya Afurika gusa - Etiyopiya, Malawi, u Rwanda na Uganda - birashoboka ko byujuje ibyinshi muri byo.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know Four African countries - Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda - are likely to meet most of these requirements.
693	This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years. The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015. The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030.	Iri suzuma rirakaze cyane bitewe n’ibibazo bikomeye bitegereje ibi bihugu mu myaka iri imbere. MDGs yihaye intego ibihugu kugabanya ubukene bw’ubukene bitarenze 2015. Icyiswe intego z’iterambere rirambye, kiva aho MDGs ziva, zirahamagarira guca ubukene mu 2030.	This survey is very serious because of the challenges ahead. MDGs set a goal to reduce poverty by 2015 and the Sustainable Development Goals, which come from MDGs, call for a reduction in poverty by 2030.
694	According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off.	Nk’uko byatangajwe na Taffere Tesfachew, umuyobozi wa UNCTAD ukorana n'ibihugu by'Afurika, nta kintu na kimwe cyaba ari igitangaza kuri LDCs kubikuramo.	As Taffere Tesfachew, UNCTAD negotiator for Africa, said, there is no surprise that LDCs are going to be able to negotiate.
695	In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies.	Kugirango ibihugu bidateye imbere bigere kuri iyi mikorere yigitangaza, avuga ko bizakenera guhindura imiterere yubukungu.	If you cannot translate this simply say you don't know. To get to this miracle, he says that developing countries must change their economic structures.
696	He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services.	Abwira IJWI ibi bivuze guhindura imirimo mu bikorwa bifite umusaruro muke, nk'ubuhinzi buciriritse na serivisi ku bikorwa byinshi bifite umusaruro mwinshi, nko gukora na serivisi zifite agaciro kanini.

697	"""Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, that is why this call for manufacturing,"" he said. ""Countries that are using policies to shift and influence capital and labor to move into this activity sector tend to do better."""	"Ibihugu byazamutse ni byo bitanga amahirwe ku bava mu buhinzi kwishora mu bintu bongerera agaciro, aho bakura amahugurwa kandi uko bigenda, inganda zikunda kugira ibintu nk'ibyo, niyo mpamvu ibi guhamagarira gukora .

"If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know The developed countries offer opportunities for those who are going to become entrepreneurs, where they get training and when they do, the industries tend to have such things, so this is encouraging to do so. ""The countries that use politics to change and change funding and work to enter this sector do well."""
698	Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods. This, he says, encourages investment.	Tesfachew avuga ko izo nzego zitanga umusaruro mwinshi zikunda kwishyura umushahara munini kandi bigatuma ibicuruzwa bikenerwa. Avuga ko ibi bitera inkunga ishoramari.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
699	On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly. UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community. And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year.	Ku isura, bigaragara ko LDC idakora nabi.

In the face, it looks like LDC is not doing badly. UNCTAD economic data show that the developing countries developed beyond the seven percent target set by the international community. And, after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD says that LDC has developed faster than other developing countries, at a rate of 5.7 percent per year.
700	But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain. They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty.	Ariko abahanga mu bukungu bo muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika bavuga ko icyerekezo cy’ibihugu bitaratera imbere mu gihe gito kandi giciriritse bikomeje kutamenyekana. Bavuga ko kongera umusaruro w’abaturage aribwo buryo bwiza bwo guca intege iterambere ry’abantu n’ubukungu bikomeje kubashora mu bukene.	But economists in the United States say that the direction of countries that are not developing in a short and medium term is still unknown. They say that increasing the income of the people is the best way to avoid the growth of the people and the economy that are continuing to sway them.

706	African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow. Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity.

If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know The African countries are still not in the brink of reducing poverty by 2015, and their general progress in reducing poverty is slow. Poverty cuts people's development and cuts their income. Economic development is needed to increase people's development.

708	The post-2015 development agenda for fragile countries where governance remains an issue — such as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo — will still largely depend on support from the international community to achieve social and economic development, Davis said.

Davis said that the post-2015 development plan for fragile countries where governance is still a problem - such as Sudan's eastern and Democratic Republic of Congo - will be heavily supported by international aid to increase their living standards and economic growth.
709	"Improvements in rural development, industrial productivity, agriculture and the services sectors in these countries will require ""ways in which we can have a pattern of growth which is not just sustainable but jobs-rich,"" Davis said. ""Because we see the growth in jobs and employment is central to any development strategy that aims to reduce poverty in a sustainable way."""
