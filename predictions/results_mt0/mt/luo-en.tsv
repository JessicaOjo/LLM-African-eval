Ne ochun Dr Kocholla mondo odhi e rusa nikech wachore ni ok oti maber kendo mano omiyo  weche richo ahinya e osiptandno.	Dr. Kocholla would have to go to the hospital because he knew he was going to be sick and he would have to wait a week for a diagnosis.

"I heard him say: ""I am a prisoner, but I have a duty to protect my dignity and to protect the innocent, and I am a prisoner of the faith."""

Onego omi Dr Ogolla kinde moromo mondo oti gi lony mare kondo orie weche ma ne jotelo machon oketho.”"	"""However, I have a fever that I need to get checked. I need to see Dr. Ogolla to see if he can explain the fever to me."""
179	Mbom argued that the recommendation by the MCAs to reinstate Dr Kocholla is tantamount to interfering with the provision of health services at the hospital.	Mbom ne owacho ni sama Jo Od Bura kwayo ni odwok Dr Kocholla e tich gi donjore gi weche thieth mag osiptandno.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
180	“The change of management was made to correct weaknesses which impeded the proper provision of health services in the hospital. Any attempts to defeat the changes mean impending delivery of health services to Homa Bay residents,” Mbom said.

If you can't translate simply say you don't know Van Klinken is a very famous singer and songwriter. For example, he is a very famous singer of the LGBTI community.
857	This eloquently written book bravely pushes boundaries.	Bugno nyiso maonge luoro moro amora kaka ji onego we buono jogo.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
858	It is remarkable in style and clarity but also brings out the author’s own vulnerabilities, strengths and compassion as an HIV positive gay scholar and activist.	Ondik bugno e yo mawinjore maler ahinya kata kamano, olero bende nyawo moko ma jandikono nigo kod gik moberie nikech jandiko nigi tuo mar ayaki kendo okedo ne ratiro mar chwo ma kendore gi chwo wetegi.

859	I have known and worked with him for a long time, and this book marks a shift from abstract and academic writing to a creative documentary about the very personal lives of real people. It straddles the gap between academia and LGBTI activism.	Ang'eyo jandikono kendo asetiyo kode kuom ndalo malach, to bugni opogore gi buge mamoko ma oting'oga mana rieko mag skul kar mano en to owuyo e wi ngima joma nitie adier. Onyiso pogruok mantie wi somo mapile kod somo mar LGBTI.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
860	The book is also a departure from despair and crippling homophobia.	Bugno bende golo luoro ma ji nigago e wi LGBTI.	Return only if you cannot translate. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
861	It records the experiences of people who refuse to be hopeless victims: people with hope and urgency, who navigate between resistance and human flourishing, creating more space for community and affirmation. 	Bugno oting'o sigand joma ok dwar dak e mudho, ma gin joma nigi geno kendo kata obedo ni ikwedogi, ging'eyo ni ginyalo dak maber to mano kelo dongruok.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
862	It allows its subjects to tell their own stories.	Bugno chiwo thuolo mondo ji owach sigandgi giwegi.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
863	The book examines four cases: activism through art, such as the works of the late Binyavanga Wainaina; music by the gay gospel artiste George Barasa; the Stories of Our Lives anthology of short films; and the Cosmopolitan Affirming Church in Nairobi.	Bugno wuoyo e gik moko ang'wen: kedo ne ratiro kokalo kuom wende, buge kod gik migoro, kaka mondik gi Binyavanga Wainaina; wende mondik gi George Barasa; sinembe machieko chieko miluongo ni Stories of Our Lives; Kanisa moro mantie Nairobi.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know The narrative is a combination of a journey, a story, or a story book, but only written by Binyavanga Wainaina; written by George Barasa; a few hundred stories published by Stories of Our Lives; imagine a man living in Nairobi.
864	In each of these, the author shows how LGBTI actors have reclaimed visibility and engaged Christian beliefs, texts and symbols.	E moro kamoro kuom wechego, jandiko nyiso kaka jo LGBTI osemedo ng'ere kendo gimakore gi puonj Jokristo kod buge.	In one of the cases, the text shows that only LGBTI people are being discriminated against and that they are being persecuted by the Christian and the pagans.
865	The use of case studies allows for rich and in-depth examinations of the ways in which the LGBTI community in Nairobi is reclaiming social, political, cultural, spiritual and artistic spaces.	Tiyo gi ranyisi mosetimore e ngima ji konyo mondo ji one kaka jokanyo mag LGBTI mantie Nairobi omako kamaduong' e ngima ji, siasa kod din.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
866	Wainaina took on Christian clergy and homophobes, calling them out for their hypocrisy, in particular Pentecostal Christianity.	Wainaina nowuoyo kuom wuondruok ma jotend kanisa nigo kod kaka gibuono ji, ahinya ahinya jo Pentecostal Christianity.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
867	He made this a personal struggle in which he came out as gay and used his body as a site for resistance, vulnerability, acceptance and rejection.	Nowuoyo kuom ngimane owuon kane owacho ni ohero chwo wetene kende ne oyie mondo ji obwone kendo okwede.	If you can't translate this simply say you don't know.
868	His activism gave impetus to the LGBTI community in Kenya and further afield and his death continued to provoke debates about LGBTI issues.	Ranyisi mare nojiwo joma nie riwruok mara LGBTI Kenya kendo tho mare ne omiyo ji odhi nyime wuoyo e wi LGBTI.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
869	The video of the song Same Love (Remix) by Art Attack caused huge excitement in the Kenyan artistic and social scene.	Vidio mar wer miluongo ni Same Love (Remix) mower gi Art Attack nomiyo Jo-Kenya manyeny ma jower owuoyo.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
870	The song is about LGBTI struggles, gender equality and civil liberties.	Wendno wuoyo e wi chandruoge ma LGBTI romogo kendo owuoyo e chiwo ratiro marom ne ji te.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
871	Yet the song serves as a space for political and theological activism. 	To ema pod jodin kod josiasa kwedo werno.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
872	It serves as a beautiful cultural expression of African queer politics – and was promptly banned by Kenya’s Film Control Board.	Wendno nyiso paro ma Jo-Afrika nigo e wi mon mohero mon kod chwo mohero chwo kendo nogo wendo marfuk gi Kenya Film Control Board.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know
873	The song crossed social, theological and cultural boundaries and focused attention on the theology of radical and non-normative love.	Wendno nokalo kiewo mag chike oganda kod puonj kanisa kendo wendno ne jiwo hera ma ok ber.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
874	Rap music has long been used as a space for protest and activism.	Wende miluongo ni rap ema kinde mang'eny itiyogo kikwedo kata ng'anjo ne gimoro.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
875	Stories of Our Lives by the Nest, a Nairobi-based arts collective, is a collection of personal stories based on interviews with ordinary gay people.	Sinema miluongo ni 'Stories of Our Lives' molos gi Nest ma en grup moro mantie Nairobi, oting'o sigand ji mopogore opogore ma gin joma diher kendore gi chwo wetegi.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
876	Like Same Love, it was promptly banned by the film board, a body that has frequently frustrated Kenya’s creativity in the guise of protecting the nation’s moral fabric.	Mana kaka wer mar 'Same Love', en be ne ogoye marfuk gi film board,ma en bura ma osegawang'o I Jokenya nyading'eny gi timgi mar wuondruok ni girito timbe maler e piny.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
877	The more the film is banned, the more it is downloaded.	Kaka imedo go vidiono marfuk e kaka ji mang'eny medo manye.	If you cannot translate it simply say you don't know.
878	It addresses themes such as identity, love, sex, faith and spirituality, stories that capture the diversity of contemporary Kenyan queer lives and their day-to-day experiences.	Vidiono wuoyo e wi weche kaka fwenyruok, hera, nindruok, yie kod din ma gin weche momako Jo-Kenya manie LGBTI.	Return only to the original. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
879	Personal stories are not just authentic, they are also empowering and affirming. They give voice and impetus to communities in struggle.	Sama ng'ato lero gima otimore e ngimane owuon, mano jiwo jomoko kendo ji nyalo bedo gadier gi wechego. Gikonyo e lando pek ma ji romogo.	If you don't know what happens to you, you can simply say you don't know.
880	The last case study is that of the Cosmopolitan Affirming Church, a social and spiritual space where members of the LGBTI community can practise their faith in community with each other.	Wach mogik minono en kanisa miluongo ni Cosmopolitan Affirming Church, ma orkwo ji duto kendo kanyo ero jo LGBTI nyalo bedo thuolo gi jowetegi.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
881	It is a safe space to create gay and radical theologies; a space for acceptance and love. 	En kama inyalo riwo joma nindore gi chwo kata mon wetegi kod puonj din, kama orwakie ji duto kendo hera nitie.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
882	It is a space where faith and radical love and sexuality meet.	Mano en kama yie kod hera ma ok pile kod joma kit nindrukgi opogore romoe.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
883	Van Klinken identifies with the struggles of his research subjects but was able to maintain some distance when writing about them.	Kata obedo ni weche ma Van Klinken ondiko chalre gi matimore e ngimane, ne owuye kuome owuon.	Although Van Klinken's theory was based on a theory of a few days, he was able to explain it without a theory.
884	This is the kind of book I will read again and again as a straight, Christian, female academic and commentator.	Ma en buk mabiro somo nyanding'eny kata obedo ni an to an nyako ma jakristo mohero yawuoyi kendo ohero ndiko.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
885	I will happily share it not just with my students and library but also with those who would like to better understand these contested lives and spaces.	Abiro nyiso jopuonjrena bugni kendo kete e laibrari mara, bende daher nyiso jogo madwaro ng'eyo joma ngimagi opogore gi mekwa.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
886	Many spiritual leaders need to read it to understand that LGBTI communities are creating their own spaces of worship where they find love and acceptance of their humanity as children of God.	Jotend din onego osom bugni mondo ging'e ni LGBTI loso giwegi kama ginyalo leme ma ji biro rwakogi kendo herogi kaka nyithi Nyasaye.	If you cannot translate this simply say you don't know.
887	This book evokes many feelings but also forces one to confront one’s own uninformed biases.	Bugni chiero paro mang'eny kuom ng'ato moriwo nyaka chuny mar buono ma ng'ato ne ok par ni en-go	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
888	It’s a good read for those who often shout the loudest, without sufficient understanding of LGBTI lives.	Joma paroga ni ong'eyo LGBTI onego osom bugni mondo kik giwach gik ma ok ging'eyo.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
889	Mike Rua (pictured), the self-proclaimed king of Mugithi, says he lives for the vulgar.	Mike Rua (Monyis e picha), ma luongore ni ruodh Mugithi, wacho ni ohero weche mochido.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know Mike Rua (Monyis in the picture), but the latter is Rudh Mugithi, who is a very good judge.
890	Rua, who has built his popularity in the music industry by spitting lyrics that raise more than eyebrows on stage, says he cannot change his style of music.	Rua mong'ere nikech oweroga wende mochido wacho ni ok onyalo loko yo mowergo.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
891	He says his attempt to tone down has seen him clash with his fans.	Owacho ni joherane ok dwar ni otim lokruok e thumbe.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
892	He now says he will take it a notch higher and his new composition will be even more lewd.	Owacho ni odwa goyo okang' momedore kendo wende moloso manyien oting'o weche maricho ahinya.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
893	He recalls how in 2012, during a music tour in Dubai, police were called on him on allegations that he was impersonating Mike Rua.	Oparo kaka e higa mar 2012, ka ne odhi wer Dubai, noluongne polise nikech ne wachore ni owuondore ni en Mike Rua.	Only in 2012, when he was in Dubai, he was arrested by police because he was suspected of killing Mike Rua.
894	After a two-hour performance at an event attended by hundreds of Kenyans in the diaspora, Rua was accosted by the police.	Bang' wer kuom seche ariyo e nyasi moro ma ne oting'o Jo-Kenya modak loka, polis ne omako Rua.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
895	A fan had complained that the man who performed was not Rua.	Nitie ng'ama nochiwo ripot ni ng'ar maweno ok en Rua.	I don't know what to say if I can't translate.
896	Police told him that the Rua the fans knew and the Rua who had performed that night were two different people. 	Polis nonyise ni Rua ma ji ong'eyo gi Rua ma ne ower otienono ne gin ji ariyo mopogore.	Police believe the suspected arsonist is a suspected arsonist.
897	They felt they had not received a good dose of his music after he decided to tone down his wordings.	Ne giwacho ni ne ok ower mamit nikech ne ok otiyo gi weche mochido.	I told you that I was going to be a bitch because I was going to be a bitch.
898	The same message has been told by his fans in Nairobi who have asked him to go back to the original Rua – the man who spits venom on stage. 	Mano be e gima joherane man Nairobi osenyise ni olokre obed Rua machon ma ne wacho weche makech ka sum sama ower.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
899	The Kikuyu benga artiste is, however, bidding good bye to performing songs composed by other musicians.	Jathum ma benga ma Ja-Kikuyuno wacho ni odwa weyo wero wende mondik jothum mamoko.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know the laws of the land and that you don't know the laws of the land.
900	“This is what my fans want. I have to give them what they demand for otherwise I will be out of business,” he says.	"Owacho kama, ""Ma e gima joma ohero wendega dwaro. Nyaka atim kaka gidwaro nono to ohanda biro podho."""	"He said, ""But that's what I want to do. I just want to do something that I don't want to do."""
901	He says he has in the past found himself brushing shoulders with the police over copyright infringement.	Owacho ni e kinde mokalo, polise osemake nyading'eny ni okwalo wende jomoko.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
902	Rua has risen to fame by remixing compositions by other musicians, which he twists to make almost a new composition.	Rua nobedo gi huma nikech ondikoga manyien wende jothum moko kae to ogwenyogi giwuog ka wer manyien.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
903	He says remixing will now be a thing of the past.	Owacho ni koro oweyo tiyo gi wende jomoko.	You know that you're going to be able to do it.
904	He has hit the studio to record new songs, including one titled Kiarie, which is already out.	Owacho ni ne osedhi e studio mowero wende manyien ma achiel kuomgi iluongo ni Kiarie ma sani yudore.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
905	And true to his spirit and motto, he has spiced up the new album with a tinge of vulgarities.	To mana kaka nosingore ni obiro timo, wer manyienno opong' gi weche mochido.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
906	In an interview with the Saturday Standard at his Syokimau home, Rua says media houses had at first almost shunned the composition on the basis that it was lewd.	Rua nonyiso oboke mar Saturday Standard, ka en dalane Syokimau, nowacho ni ute fwambo notamore kawo wer mare nikech oting'o weche molil.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
907	But things changed when the album, which is complete with a video, became a hit on social media and is now popularly played in many vernacular FM radio stations.	Kata kamano, weche nolokore kane otieko loso albam ma nigi vidio kendo ji mang'eny nohere e social media kendo oket wendego e stesen mag redio mang'eny.	However, I would like to encourage you to submit your video and other content to social media and to listen to other radio stations.
908	Rua says ‘Kiarie’, which in Kikuyu means wide, is based on his real life experience.	Rua wacho ni 'Kiarie', ma e dho Kikuyu mano tiende gima lach, wuoyo kuom gik mosekaloe e ngimane.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
909	It is the story of a young man, struggling to make it in life and ends up cohabiting with a sugar mummy.	En sigand dichwo moro ma pod tin, ma nyagore gi ngima to gikone odak gi miyo moro ma ochot.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
910	And the sugar mummy at times confuses him (Rua) with Kiarie.	Miyo ma ochotno seche moko paro ni Rua en Kiarie.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
911	But this is not all about the song as is expected of Rua.	To mano ok e wach kende ma wer losoe mana kaka Rua.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
912	He tantalises the composition with a hidden message of his love life to the sugar mummy and there in fits the hidden message of ‘Kiarie’.	Owacho ni nitie gimopondo mitemo ler ei wendno ma en hera moherogo miyono mano ema omiyo iluonge ni 'Kiarie'.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
913	The composition leaves it to the listener to decode which ‘Kiarie’ he is referring to.	Yo mondikgo werno mondo jawinjo ema yiero ni en 'Kiarie' mane ma iwuoyo kuome.	You don't know what the 'Kiarie' is, but you know what it is.
914	Apart from Rua, other upcoming Kikuyu musicians such as Samuel Ndirangu, alias Samido, are giving the veterans a run for their money.	Mopogore gi Rua, jothum moko mag Kikuyu ma nyocha eka ochako wer gin Samuel Ndirangu, mong'ere kaka Samido piem matek gi jower machon.	Except for Rua, a Kikuyu soldier who was killed by Samuel Ndirangu was killed by Samido, who was killed by a sword.
915	Samido is famed for his songs Wendo wi Cama (love is sweet) and Murata wa Ngai (Friend of God), which have been topping the FM airwaves. 	Samido ong'ere nikech wendege kaka Wendo wi Cama (hera mit) kod Murata wa Ngai (Osiep Nyasaye) ma ojagaket e redio.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
916	He did Wendo wi Cama together with Joys wa Mama.	Ne owero Wendo wi Cama kaachiel gi Joys wa Mama.	I knew that I was going to be a joy to my mother.
917	Jose Gatutura is another sensation.	Jose Gaturura be en jawer machielo ma ji ohero.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know Jose Gaturura is a former judge.
918	The musical star of the Machete hit maker has been rising with every new release.	Ne owero wer ma ji mang'eny ong'eyo miluongo ni Machete kendo humbe medo landore gi wer ka wer mogolo manyien.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
919	Among his prominent songs are Tuirio twega (good food), Mwari wa Muthamaki (Daughter of a king) and Haha ni Gute (this is vanity).

929	Today, many people, especially Africans find it hard to identify with their cultural values and way of life as a result of embrace to modernisation and civilisation.	E kindewagi, ji mang'eny ahinya ahinya Jo Afrika, yudo ka teknegi makore gi kit ngima mar ogandagi kendo gihero timo kendo luwa kit ngima ma nyasani.	In fact, many Africans are very aware of the technical advantages of a foreign language and would like to learn and learn to speak a different language.

"Kwambai nowacho kama, ""Daher ni tieng' mabiro ong'e kaka kit ngima Jo-Afrika ne chalo kod kaka ne gitimo gik moko, omiyo asebedo ka achoko gik machon mag Jo-Keiyo kendo kanogi e museum mantie Chekobei ei Keiyo South Sub-county kuom higni 20."""

1163	In this way, we expect the role of AI in index investing will have a knock-on effect of improving asset owner and asset manager decisions, focusing them on working with portfolio companies over longer time horizons and supporting companies that, for instance, need to transition away from poor carbon outcomes.

1171	Firms will need to invest in experts to monitor the AI and ensure it functions and make adjustments when needed	Kembe biro dwaro mondo joma oluoch gi wach mar AI orangi kaka otiyo mondo one ni otimo tich maber kendo oketo puogruok kama dwarore.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
1172	This means that investment decisions will still be largely reliant on individual judgement and common patterns of biases, much like they have for the past 20 years.	Ma nyiso ni ngado bura kuom kaka jo mwandu nyalo bedo mwandu gi pod biro mana tim gi dhano kaluwore gi kaka dwaro mar dhano masani chal.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1173	Using AI in investment management also creates new risks and challenges.	Tiyo gi AI e yor medo mwandu bende kelo lal kod chandruok ma moko e chiro.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
1174	A model is only as good as the data you put into it – so model opacity and data integrity matter. 	Ngama oloso gi lwet dhano nyalo mana tiyo maber kaluwore gi kit gigo ma okete.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
1175	And questions about the ethics in justifying or bounding AI investment decisions will also need to be answered, as well as issues surrounding the regulation of AI systems, the risks of heightened pro-cyclical investment activity and the current lack of a monitoring framework, as AI plays an ever-increasing role in the investment decision-making process.	Penjo kuom kaka ji biro bedo gi kido maber ka gitiyo gi AI kuom ngado bura mar ohala bende biro dwarore mondo oduoki maber, ka achiel gi chike matayo kaka AI owinjore oti, chandruok ma tiyo gi yoo manyien ni nyalo kelo kendo gi bedo maonge yoo ma inyalo pim go kaka otiyo nikech AI konyo ahinya kuom ngado bura kaka jomwandu nyalo kelo bedruok e mwandu gi.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1176	These questions matter because of the need to maintain and improve the level of trust and confidence in investment management and the broader financial system in general.	Penjo gi duto gin gik ma roteke nikech dwaro ni ji obedo gi yie kuom tiyo gi paro manyien e weche mag rito mwandu kod yore ma itayo go kaka pesa wuodho e piny.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1177	This is partially achieved by explaining transparently how ethical and social responsibility factors can be included in the investment decision-making process at the portfolio, strategic and regulatory levels, so that AI can be developed with proper balance.	Ma nyalo timore ka oler ne ji e yoo ma oyangore kaka kido maber kod kawo ting mar tich inyalo bedi e seche ma ji konyore gi paro e weche mag rito mwandu e okang’ ma opogore opogore kaka e kambi kod ka bad Piny Owacho ma ngiyo wechego. Ma biro miyo AI obed gima ngiyo koni gi koni.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1178	At the same time, trust and confidence can only be gained if frameworks are developed to control pro-cyclical investment activity, monitor AI decision-making impacts in financial markets, and enforce the role of human interaction in the investment-management process to oversee and communicate decisions (whether by human or AI).	E seche go, bedo gi chung ma ojawore kod yie ma otego no nyalo mana bede ka nitie yore ma oketi mondo otaa kaka AI tiyo kendo chero kaka bura ma ogandi ka itiyo gi rieko manyien ni kelo pogruok e yore ma pesa ringe e piny kendo keto chike ma tayo kaka dhano biro tiyo gi Ai e yore duto ma dwarore - obed ni en tich dhano kata AI.

1180	In order to allow for these positive developments, we need to identify the key stakeholders to manage and encourage positive AI development in the investment management process.	Ma biro dwaro sirikal, jogo man gi mwandu, jogo ma rito mwandu, jo keno, jogo man go loch matut e yor kano mwandu, jogo ma osomo chike kod joma ochung ne ji achiel achiel ma bende tiyo tinj ni.

1181	These include regulators, asset owners, asset managers, custodians, investment consultants, legal experts and representatives of retail investors. 	Ma biro dwaro sirikal, jogo man gi mwandu, jogo ma rito mwandu, jo keno, jogo man go loch matut e yor kano mwandu, jogo ma osomo chike kod joma ochung ne ji achiel achiel ma bende tiyo tinj ni.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1182	We need to bring stakeholders together to agree upon an appropriate framework of ethical inputs, regulation and monitoring systems for AI.	Owinjore wakel ji kanyakla mondo gi winjre kaka weche mag kido maber, chike kendo ngiyo kaka yore ringo e wach mar AI.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
1183	Regardless of regulation and monitoring systems, asset managers also need to take it on themselves to address some of these issues in their existing investment process.

1184	We are ultimately optimistic that properly managed AI will support human judgement in managing pensions and savings – and maybe even improve your returns! – by reinforcing best practices and mitigating known biases.

1189	“We have done it before when Kenyan meat and meat products were sold worldwide and I believe once again meat products should join the growing list of food items that we export to the rest of the world,” he said.	“Nitie kinde mane wase uso ring'o ma oa Kenya e piny mangima; kuom mano, an gi yie ni ring'o bende owinjore obed achiel kuom chiemo ma watero e pinje ma oko.” Ne owacho kamano.	"If you cannot translate simply say you don't know ""I've seen a few ring's in Kenya in the past few years; so I believe that ring's might be a little more expensive than the ones you see in your country."""
1190	The Head of State said he expects the country’s beef exports to also hit the Middle East as well as emerging markets, where the population is growing and consumers have more purchasing power.	Jatend piny ne owacho ni ogeno ni ring'o ma Kenya tero oko biro chopo e pinje mag warabu gi chirni masani yudore kunde ma moko ma kwan dhano medore kendo ji nigi pesa maber mar ng'iewo gigo ma gidwaro.

1191	“The Africa continental free trade arrangement coming into force provides an opportunity that should benefit the livestock sector by harnessing the entire supply chain in the meat industry,” he said.	“Chenro mar jo Africa mar loso chiro maduong ma ji ni thuolo mar uso maonge weche mageny biro kelo ohala ne joma pidho jamni ma biro miyo nengo chiaye dhi malo ka oa kuom japith, ja uso, ngama loso ringo nyaka chop kuom jachiemo.” Ne owacho kamano.	"If you cannot translate simply say you don't know ""African cities of the diaspora have a very diverse culture, but they are often very diverse and diverse, and they are often very diverse and diverse."""
1192	The Head of State said the livestock sector’s potential extends to hides and skin, which informed his administration’s push to breathe life into the tannery industry.

1193	The president, while lauding the positive changes at the commission since its transfer to the Ministry of Defence, said time was ripe for KMC to reclaim its role in the country’s economy.

1194	He said interest from Kenya Prisons, National Youth Service, Kenya Wildlife Service, and police training college contracting KMC for their supplies was a sign of the renewed trust in the commission.	Ne owacho ni bedo ni migepe sirikal mag Jo Jela – Kenya Prisons, Joma Tiego Nyithindo – National Youth Service, Joma Rito Le – Kenya Wildlife Service kod Joma tiego Obila – Police Training College dwaro miyo KCM tich mar tero negi ringo ma gichamo nyiso ni ji sani nigi yie kuom jo yang’ ringo no.

If you can't translate KMC, just say you don't know KMC, and that's why you're going to Migawo Mar Pur and Migawo Mar Rito Piny.
1196	While the move has been contested in court, President Kenyatta yesterday defended the decision albeit with a lot of care.	Kata obedo ni wach mar lokruok no oseter e doho mondo ong'i ane ka bende ne otime ka oluwore gi chike mag piny Kenya, Ker Kenyatta nyoro otemo lero ni gino ne otim kaluwore gi chike mag Kenya, kotang'.	Although the constitutional amendment was designed to ensure that the president would not be able to negotiate with the Kenyan parliament, Kenyatta would probably have voted to negotiate with the Kenyan parliament, rather than negotiate with the Kenyan parliament.
1197	“Past administration has made efforts to jumpstart KMC, but for reasons which are known never succeeded and a lot of public funds went astray,” he said.	“Pich Owacho mokalo ne otemo mar chiero KMC to nikech weche ma ong'ere, ne ok gichiere kata obedo ni pesa mar jopiny to ne okethore kamano.” Ne owacho.	If you don't know what to do, just say you don't know.
1198	He noted the transfer had eased payments to farmers — some who had gone for four years without compensation after supplying animals.	Ne owacho ni luokruok mane obedono omiyo jo pith chiaye sani yudo chudo margi mayot – moko kuom gi ne osebet higni ang'wen ka ok ochulgi.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.

If you live in the southern corner of KMC in Athi River, Ker knew that KMC was a military force in Kenya which could have a significant impact on the economy.
1204	He challenged the facility to not only focus on meeting meat demand locally but plan on exporting the surplus to Europe, Middle East and Africa.	Ker ne ojiwo jo yang’ ringo go mondo kik gi tem mano miyo Jo Kenya ringo to ber ka gi bedo gi chenro mar tero ringo ma odong’ e pinje jo wagunda, warabu kod Africa.	If you don't know where to find a ringo, simply say you don't know.
1205	“I don’t want to see KMC slipping back to olden days when farmers were paid after four years or not paid, maintain the payment period at 72 hours,” said Uhuru.	“Ok adwar neno KMC ka dong chien e ndalo mane jo pith dhok ne ichulo bang’ higi agwen kata bedo ni ok ochul gi; kuom mano, owinjore gi siki ka gi chulo joma miyo gi dhok go kapok seche 72 orumo ma en ka pok juma achiel orumo.” Ohuru ne owacho kamano.	"If you cannot translate simply say you don't know ""I asked KMC to determine the cause of the damage and told them that I would not be able to destroy it; therefore, I would always carry it to the rescue center and carry it to the rescue center for 72 hours."""
1206	“As we focus on the European and Middle East markets, let us also focus on Africa where the population is growing and consumers growingly have better purchasing power,” he added also noting the new African Continental Free Trade Area offers better opportunities.	Ka sani koro wangiyo kaka wanyalo tero ringo loka e pinje mag wasunge kod warabu, ber ka wangiyo uru bende kaka wanyalo uso ringo e Africa ka; kama nitie medruok mar dhano kendo kama jo chiemo bende sani koro nigi pesa maber mar ngiewo gik ma gidwaro.” Ne owacho kamano ka omedo ni riwruok mar pinje mag jo Africa ma sani biro keto thuolo mar uso gik moko ma onge akwede kata weche mangeny ma miyo uso bedo matek biro miyo johala kinde maber mar uso gige gi thuolo.

1207	The State-owned meat processor operated below capacity before the takeover facing challenges that included the unreliable supply of raw material and an ageing plant, which slowed down its operations.
