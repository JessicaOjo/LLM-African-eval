This follows a news report by the Reuters news agency quoting Aspens Senior to shut down as there have been no orders for their rebranded COVID vaccine.
109	A South African-owned subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Aspen struck a deal with American company Johnson & Johnson in March to package, price, sell and distribute its vaccine in Africa.

110	This vaccine was rebranded as Aspenovax.	Musonga wekudzivirira Covid uyu wakazopiwazita idzva rekuti Aspenovax.	Return only if you cannot translate. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
111	The move was hailed by many as there had been much concern about Africas reliance on imported vaccines which were often costly and at times in short supply.	Chiitiko ici chakarumbidzwa nevazhinji nekuti pakange paine kushushikana kukuru pamusoro pekuti Africa yaipona nemishonga inobva kune dzimwe nyika iyo yainge ichidhura uye ichinestsa kuwana.	This event was a huge success because there was a great concern about the availability of drugs from other countries that were easy to find.
112	But there have been no orders for Aspenovax. South Africas National Health Department Spokesperson Foster Mohale said the lack of orders is due to low vaccination rates not only at home, but globally.	Asi mishonga yeAspenovax iyi yange isina ari kutenga. VaFoster Mohale, mutauriri wechikamu chinoona nezvehutano muSouth Africa vakati kusatengwa kwemishonga uku kwaikonzereswa nekuti kune vanhu vashoma chose varikubaiwa majekiseniekudzivirira Covid kwete muAfrica chete, asi pasi rose.	But the supply of the vaccine was unavailable. According to Foster Mohale, a South African health official, there are very few people in the world who are receiving Covid vaccine.
113	Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production. 	Vakatiwo kuzengurira kubaiwa ndicho chimwe chezvikonzero zviri kuita kuti pane nekuderera kwevanobaiwa majekiseni ekudzivirira kana kuwanda kwekutengwa kwemishonga iyi zviri kukanganisa basa rekugadzira iyi.	They also said that the lack of availability of vaccine certificates or the increase in the sale of these drugs has been a factor in the failure of the production process.
114	Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low. 	Nekuti tinonzwisisawo kuti vanhu ava vari mubhindauko rekuitawo mari, naizvozvo havagone kungoramba vachigadzira mishonga iyi  asi vachiziva kuti vanoda kuishandisa vashoma.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. Because we understand that these people are in a business of making money, they cannot simply keep making these drugs but know that only a few people want to use them.
115	So, we understand the situation where they are, and we sympathize with them, he said.	Naizvozvo, tinonzwisisa kuti pavari pakaoma uye tonovanzwira tsitsi.	So, we understand that it's hard for them and we care about them.
116	Mohale said for now, South Africa has enough vaccines.	VaMohale vakati pari zvino, South Africa ine mishonga inokwana.	Mohale said that, at present, South Africa has enough medicine.
117	He adds that in March, 100,000 vaccines expired. And more are due to expire in June and July.

Uye mimwe mishonga mizhinji ichasvika pakusashanda muna Chivabvu naChikunguru.	They also say that in March over a thousand medications have reached the withdrawal date before they are effective. And many more medications will reach the withdrawal date in May and June.
118	However, he said that Aspens vaccine plant is important because no one knows what the future holds.	Zvisineyi, vakati mushina wekugadzira mushonga weAspens wakakosha nokuti hapana anoziva kuti ramangwana rineyi.	However, they said that the ability to make a medicinal spice was important because no one knows what the future is like.
119	We will try to engage them not to rush their decision precisely because we anticipate especially our scientists, our epidemiologists, we anticipate that the fifth wave might hit the country, South Africa, during the winter season which is a few weeks away from now.	"Vakati, 'Tichaedza kutaura navo kuti vasamhanye pahurongwa hwavo nekuti tiri kutarisira zvikuru sei nyanzvi dzedu dzesainzi, nyanzvi dzedu dzinoona nezvekudzivirira kupararira kwemadenda, tinotarisira kuti kusimuka kwedenda kwechishanu kucharova nyika yeSouth Africa mumwaka wechando uyo wasarirwa nemasvondo mashomanana kuti usvike."""	They said, 'We will try to talk to them to avoid their plan because we are very confident of our scientific experts, our experts on disaster prevention, we expect that the fifth earthquake will destroy South Africa in the winter which is due to start in a few weeks.'
120	As you can see the number of daily COVID-19 patients has been rising for the past seven days, he said.

The professor Terrablanche said, This also shows how important it is for this African country to think about the importance of changing structures and ways of working.
123	This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies. 	 Iyi inyaya yekuona kuti tichaita se kuti tapa mikana yekutenga kumakambani emudunhu remuno.	This is a matter of finding out how to get a chance to buy from local companies.

How can we create a market for buying and selling and conditions that will enhance our competitiveness in our local markets?
125	Otherwise, we will not have capacity locally in a sustainable manner and were going to get the next pandemic and we will be unprepared, and we will not have health security, said Terblanche.

The group which advocates for the rights of press reporting said that what it would see in its investigations is disturbing, because it shows a very deep gap between the press reporting organizations in each country and across the world.

217	That has forced most remaining independent news outlets, including the renowned Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Ekho Moskvy radio and Dozhd TV, to shut down or move outside Russia to continue operating.

This forced many independent media companies that were still working in Russia to close or leave the country to continue their work. These included the popular newspaper Novaya Gazeta, the newspaper, the radio station Ekho Moskvy and the spiritual television channel Dozhd TV.
218	With independent voices absent, experts say, the Russian government has been able to flood state-run airwaves with propaganda that downplays the war and spreads false or misleading justifications for the Kremlin's invasion.

Russia is fifty-sixth in the rankings of the RSF, where the first is the most free and the fifty-sixth is the most dangerous.

When we get here, we can all agree that the freedom of reporting of the events we've been eating has been a huge advantage, Clayton said.

Akatizve, mumakore makumi maviri nemaviri mutungamiriri weRussia Vladimir Putin achitonga, Moscow yanga yakangosona vatapi venhau nemasangano enhau asina divi raakarerekera.	Again, he said, in the 20 years of Vladimir Putin's rule, Moscow had only allowed journalists and newspapers to operate without a political interference.
222	But since the invasion of Ukraine, it seems that Putin has really finished off the independent media once and for all in Russia, Clayton said. 	Asi kubva Russia yapinda neganyavhu muUkraine, zvinoita sekuti Putin abva akohovedza masangano enhau akazvimiririra muRussia, Clayton akadaro.	But since Russia has invaded Ukraine, it seems that Putin has already destroyed independent media in Russia, Clayton said.

If you cannot translate, just say you don't know.
348	The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the number of newly reported coronavirus cases and deaths globally continued to fall in the last week, continuing a decline that began in March.

If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
349	In its weekly report on the pandemic, the U.N. health agency said there were about 3.8 million new infections and more than 15,000 deaths last week, a 17% and 3% drop on the week respectively.	Muzvinyorwa zvetsvakurudzo dzaro dzinobuda svondo rega rega, sangano iri, riri chikamu chemubatanidzwa wenyika dzepasi rese chichiona nezvehutano rakati kune vanhu vangasvika mamiriyoni matatu nezviuru mazana masere vakabatwa nechirwere ichi kekutanga uyewo nendufu dzinodarika zviuru gumi nezvishanu svondo rakapfuura, kuderera kwezvikamu gumi nezvinomwe kubva muzana pane vakarwara nechirwere ichi kekutanga, nekudererawo wezvikamu zvitatu kubva muzana kwendufu musvondo irori.	In its annual report, the organization, which is part of the World Health Organization, said there were approximately three million cases of the disease and more than fifteen thousand deaths last year, a reduction of 18% from the first cases, and a reduction of 3% from the total deaths in the same week.
350	But those figures are believed to be a significant underestimate of COVID-19's true toll as increasing numbers of countries abandon widespread testing and surveillance.	Asi huwandu uhwu hwunofungidzirwa kuti hwakanyanya kuderedzwa zvachose kwekurwarisa nekuuraya kuri kuita COVID-19 sezvo nyika dziri kungoramba dzichiwedzera pahuwandu hwadzo dzakanda pasi tsika yekuongorora ropa revanhu uyezve nekuronda nekuongorora kaupararira kwedenda iri.	But this figure is believed to be the lowest estimate of the total mortality and deaths caused by COVID-19 as countries are continuing to increase their rates of testing and testing for the disease.
351	Still, WHO noted that cases rose by about a third in Africa and 13% in the Americas. 	Zvakadaro, WHO yakaona kuti hurwere hwakawedzera nechikamu chimwe chete kubva muzvitatu muAfrica uyewo nezvikamu gumi nezvitatu kubva muzana munyika dziri mudunhu reAmerica.	However, the WHO has found that the disease has increased by one third in Africa and by thirteen percent in the United States.
352	There was also a nearly 70% jump in deaths reported in India, although that was attributed to delayed reporting rather than a recent surge of disease.	Pakavawo nekusvetuka chaiko kwendufu dzakaziviswa vezvehutano muIndia, kunyangwe hazvo izvi zvakanzi kwaiva kunonoka kutaurira vezvehutano pamusoro pendufu, kusati kuri kuwedzera kwedenda.	There was also a spike in deaths reported to health authorities in India, although this was reported to be a slow announcement of deaths, before the spread of the disease.
353	Last week, authorities in South Africa said they had noted an uptick in COVID-19 cases attributable to the BA.4 mutant of omicron, although they said it was too early to tell if that would result in a significant new wave of disease.	Svondo rakadarika, vakuru muSouth Africa vakati vakaona kuti pakaita kusimukira kwevanhu vanedenda reCOVID-19 zvinzi zvaibva kumhando yechirwere inonzi BA.4 iyo inonzi yakabukira kubva mu omicron, iyo inoratidza kuti ine hukasha hwekupararira nekukurumidza kudarika omicron, kunyangwe hazvo pasati pava nenguva yakakwana yekuongorora kuti izvi zvaizoreva kuti paizova nekupararira kutsva kwedenda iri kune mutsindo.	Last week, South African officials said that they found a spike in the number of cases of COVID-19 linked to a strain of virus called BA.4 which is believed to have been imported from omicron, which indicates that it has the potential to spread faster than omicron, even though there was no enough time to assess whether this would mean a new outbreak of the disease.
354	Although the BA.4 version of COVID-19's omicron variant appears more infectious than omicron, WHO said there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death.	Kunyangwe hazvo BA.4 iyo yakabukira kubva omicron inovawo davi reCOVID-19 richiratidza kuva nehasha yekupararira nekukasira kudarika omicron, WHO yakati pakange pasina humboo hwairatidza kuti yakange ichibva yakonzera kuwedzera kwevarwere vaiendeswa kuzvipatara kana kuwanda kwendufu. there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death.	Although BA.4, which was a strain of COVID-19, shows a higher rate of spread than omicron, WHO said there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death.
355	"Salim Abdool Karim, a public health expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that while only a ""modest"" rise in cases had been noted, South Africa was also in the middle of a holiday period and testing had dropped significantly. "	"Salim Abdool Karim, nyanzvi inoona nezvehutano hweveruzhinji ichishandira paUniversity of KwaZulu-Natal, akati kunyangwe paive nekuwedzera ""kwakadzikama"" muhuwandu hwevanhu vakabatwa nedenda kwakaonekwa, South Africa yakange iri pakati penguva yezororo uyewo kuongororwa kuti vanhu vane chirwere here kwakange kwaderera zvikuru."

357	At a press briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said it was too soon to tell if COVID-19 was entering a seasonal pattern and warned against countries dropping all of their restrictions too quickly as many in the West have done.

360	Meanwhile in China, authorities continued to crack down on cities, including Beijing, where more than 10% of the subway system was shut down in an effort to curb the virus' spread, after authorities in the capital already closed down indoor dining, gyms and school classes.

433	Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image.

If they go for news, they talk to their colleagues who work with the same subject and ask them about their opinions on the issue.
517	This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important.	Chikamu chezvizvi chinobva pachishuvo chekutapa nhau pamusoro penyaya dzisina anonyora pamusoro padzo, asiwo semutapi wenhau wechidzimayi vanoshanda mudunhu rinotongwa nevanhurume, vanoti  she kushanda vanhu vachibatsirana nekutsigira vanhukadzi vavanoshanda navo zvimwe zvagara zvakakosha kuita.	Part of this comes from the desire to report on topics that no one writes about, but as a journalist working in a mixed race community, she says that being a worker with women is a very important part of being a worker.
518	I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story, the 42-year-old journalist said.	"Mutapi wenhau uyu, ane makore makumi mana nemaviri, anoti, ""Mushure mekutaura nevatore venhau vechirume nevechikadzi, ndakachizoona kuti vanhukadzi vne maonero mamwe chete, nekuti tinosangana nezvinhu zvakafanana patinenge tichitapa nhau.""."	"The journalist, who is aged 26, says, ""After talking with both male and female journalists, I realized that women have the same viewpoint, because we face the same things when we are reporting news."
519	That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria.

"No, we didn't pass them, but because most of the region is under the Islamic culture, Muslim prayer and everything is hidden, hidden and viewed as if it's for men, not for women."""
527	Having women reporters has an impact, she noted.	Akazotizve kuva nevatapi venhau vechidzimayi kunemutsindo mukuru.	He added that having female journalists is a big challenge.
528	If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict.	Kuri kunzi ndazviisa pachinzvimbo chemuverengi wenhau, ndingada chose kuti munhukadzi andiudze nyaya nekuti inenge ichibata vanhu vese vemunzvimbo yakaitikira nyaya, zvichireve kuti unozove nenyaye inotarisa nekuratidza zviri kuitika nemativi oset.

Except for Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, who is 30 years old, went to Syria to write about the war against the Islamic State (IS).
545	Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out, she said.	"Akati '""Ndakawana mukana mukuru kwazvo kuti ndigone kupinda mukati mevanhu munzvimbo dzavagere ndisina muturikiri kana munhu anondirongera kuti ndigamuchirike izvo zvinoveza nekukwenenzvera mabudiro anozoita nhau idzi."""

If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. They went to a prison camp controlled by Kurds in the north of Syria and asked questions to militants affiliated with the Islamic State, reporting for El Pais.
550	While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the camp refused to talk to them, Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS.	Ndiri kuQamishli [kumaodzanyemba akadziva kumabvazuva ekuSyria], ndakasangana nevatapi venhau vaviri vekuBritain, vavo andishanda navo zvakanaka, vakange vagumbuka mushure mekunge Shamima Begum nemamwe madzimayi pakamba iyi vakaramba kutaura navo, akadaro Sancha achitauta pamusoro pemumwe mudzimayi wechidiki akabva kumusha kwake kuBritain aine makore gumi nemashanu kuti ave nhengo yeIS.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know I was in Qamishli [in the north-east of Syria], I met two British journalists who I worked with, who were angry after Shamima Begum and other women at the camp refused to talk to them, said Sancha.
551	Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men. 	"Sancha akati, ""Gwevedzi ravo rakavarongera kutaura nevakadzi ava aiva munhurume, asi vakaramba kutaura nevatapi venhau ava, uye nekuti magandangakadzi aya vanokakatira kurutivi zvachose uye havataure nevanhurume."	"Sancha said, ""The judge refused to speak to the women who were men, but they refused to speak to the journalists, and because the women are completely turned down and do not speak to men."
552	But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents, Sancha said.	"Asi ndakagona kugara pasi ndikataura naShamima nemamwe madzimayi,  avo vakapindura mibvunzo yedu nenzira inoyemurika tiri mumatende avo mavanogara."""	"I could sit down and talk to Shamima and other women, who answered our questions in a loving way while we were in their gardens."""
553	Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added.	Akatzve Abbas akaita chikamu ckikuru mukuita kuti madzimayi aya abvume kutaura navo.	Abbas also played a big part in getting the women to speak to him.
554	Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist.	Zvisina kuita kunge Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas akakurira mudundu rinosemwa rinogara rudzi rwemaKurd muSyria, umo makange musina chinhu chinonzi kutapa nhau kusvikira pakazotanga hondo mu2011.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
555	Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines, Abbas said.	Vanhuwo zvavo mudunhu medu vakange vajaira kuona vanhukadzi vachitora zvombo kuti vanorwa uye vakange vasina kujaira kuona munhukadzi akabata chinotora mifananidzo ari mumigwagwa arikumberi kwezvirikuitika, Abbas akadaro.

"""It took me a lot of effort to get my family and the people in our area to understand that I couldn't even reach the men I work with."""
557	Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign.	Kutapa nhau kwakamukwezva nekuti nyaya nerungano rwemuMiddle East rwunositaugwa nevatapi venhau vanhurume, vari vekunedzimwe nyika nezvizvarwa zvemo.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
558	The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East, that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region, Abbas said.	Rungano urwu harwusati rwashanduka bodo nekuda kwaizvozvo, asi kana madzimayi anotapa nhau vari zvizvarwa zvemo nevekunedzimwe nyika vakawana muka chaiwo wekuti vataure nyayayezviri kuitika muMiddle East, rungano urwu rwunoshanduka rwozoshandurawo maonerwo anoitwa dunhu rino nevamwe vanhu, Abbas akadaro.	If you can't translate it, just say you don't know If foreign journalists who are natives and from other countries find a way to talk about the Middle East, the changing society will also change the view of the country by others, Abbas said.
559	Sancha also believes women in journalism have an impact on the way issues are viewed in the region, including post-traumatic stress disorder and the effect it has on female health, and subjects such as violence and alcohol.	Sancha anofungawo kuti madzimayi ari mune zvekutapwa kwenhau vane mutsindo pamusoro pekuti zvinhu zvinoonekwa sei mudunhu iri, zvinosanganisira kuvhiringikana kupfungwa nezvinzwo zvinobata munhu mushure mekunge apfuura nenguva yekurwadziswa nekutyiswa kukuru uye zvazvinoita muhutano hwemunhukadzi, zvichibatawo nyaya dzakaita sekumbunyikidzwa nedoro.	Sancha also thinks that women in journalism have a good understanding of how things are viewed in this area, including the emotional and physical effects of trauma and abuse, as well as the effects on women's health, including cases such as drug abuse.
560	We talk about all these issues that men normally wouldnt not speak about, she said.	"Akati, ""Tinotaura pamusoro penyaya dzese idzo vanhurume vasingawanzotaura nezvadzo."	"He said, ""We talk about all the things that men don't usually talk about."

587	As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void?	Sezvo Vanhu VekuAmerica Vashoma Voenda Kukereke, Zvitoro Zvinotengesa Kofi Zvingazadze Mukaha Uyu Here?	Because Americans are very few to go to church, can coffee shops fill this void?
588	Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society.

If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
589	But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.	Asi vanhu vashomanana vava kuenda kushumiro, uye kuderera uku mudzikereke nedzimwe nzvimbo dzekunamatira dzavakusiya mukaha waiogona kungozadziswa koga nezvitoro zvinotengesa svutugadzike yerudzi rwekofi.	But fewer people are going to church, and the decline in church and other places of worship has left you with a cup of coffee that could only be filled with a cup of coffee from coffee shops.
590	For so much of American history, the church has really been or their congregations have really been essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities encouraging civic engagement and political participation, says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.	Munhorondo zhinji yeAmerica, kereke kana kuti zvaunga zvemakereke, zvakange zvakakosha zviita basa risina vamwe vakamboriita rekuunza kubatana nemidzi yehukama munzvimbo dzigere vanhu, kukurudzira kuti vagari vemunzvimbo vapinzwa muhurongwa hwunobata hupenyu hwavo uye nekuridzira vagri kuti kuti vave nechekuita mune zvematongerwo, anodaro Daniel Cox, mukuru we Survey Center on American Life nemunzveri mukuru weAmerican Enterprise Institute.	In the history of America, churches or religious organizations have played a very important role in bringing together communities with roots of friendship and relationships, encouraging the participation of the local residents in a sustainable planning system and encouraging the participation of the local residents in politics, says Daniel Cox, chief executive of the Survey Center on American Life and a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute.
591	It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church, Cox says.	Zvakange zvisiri zvemasanga kana zverombo rakanaka kuti boka rairwira kodzero dzevagari vemuAmerica rakasimuka richibva mukereke, anodaroCox.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
592	And you see that cross-culturally whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important.	Uye unozoona kuti zvakatariswa mutsika nemagariro evanhu vakasiyana siyana, zvisineyi kuti hugaro hwevachena chete vari kumaruma here, mumisha yevapfumi mumadhorobha, kupi nekupi zvako, makereke munhorondo yevanhu, agara achikosha zvikurusa.	You will realize that it is being considered in culture and customs of different peoples, regardless of whether it is the privilege of the whites in the cities, in the rich cities of the cities, or everywhere else, the church in the history of mankind is still very important.
593	Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says.	"Cox anoti, 'Makereke nedzimwe nzvimbo dzekunamatira akaita basa kubatsira vanhu vanenge vatama vachibva kune dzimwe nyika kuti vakwane mutsika nemagariro matsva avanenge vapinda maari pavanosvika muAmerica."""	Cox says, 'The churches and other religious places have been a part of helping immigrants from other countries to adapt to the culture and customs they had become in America when they came to America.'
594	In 1999, 70% of Americans said they belonged to a church, mosque or synagogue.	Muna 1999, vanhu zvikamu makumi manomwe kubva muzana vemuAmerica vakati inhengo yekerek, mosque kana synagogue.	In 1999, twenty-eight percent of Americans said they were a member of a church, a mosque or a synagogue.
595	By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%. A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.

596	"Third places  Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg dubbed as ""third places"" public gathering spots that offer something that home, the ""first place,"" and work, the ""second place,"" might not."	"Nzvimbo Dzechitatu Kusabatana kana kuva nenhengo yemakereke, ma mosques nema synagogue zvinoreva kuti vanhu vanenge vachirasikirwa neizvo zvinonzi nenyanzvi inoongorora magariro netsika dzemumadhorobha,Ray Oldenburg, akadaidza kuti ""nzvimbo dzechitatu"" nzvimbo dziendwa neveruzhinji dzinopa munhu chimwe chinhu chekuti chaasingapihwe kumba inova ""nzvimbo yekutanga"" nekubasa inova ""nzvimbo yechipiri""."	"If you can't translate simply say you don't know Third places. Third places are places where people go to get something they can't get at home, which is ""first place"" and work is ""second place""."
597	Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.	Oldenburg anoti nzvimbo dzechitatu idzi dzakakosha pakuunza hutano kumagariro anoita vanhu munzvimbo yavanenge vagere.	Oldenburg says these third areas are important in bringing health to the environment of the people who live there.
598	An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.	Tsvakurudzo yakaitwa muna 2021 nesangano rezvetsvakurudzo muAmerica re American Survey Center rakaona kuti  nzvimbo dzinoitwa zvekutengesera vanhu dzakaita sezvitoro zvinotengesa svutugadzike dzinovaka kuvimbikana nekubatana munzvimbo dzinogara vanhu vemuAmerica, uye dzaigona kuzadza mukaha wakasiiwa nemakereke.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. A study conducted in 2021 by the American Survey Center found that stores like a pharmacy foster a healthy attitude toward society and could fill the gap left by churches.
599	If you're a regular at a cafe, the barista may know what you usually order, and they can make it for you, and that feels good, says clinical psychologist Dr. Maria Espinola, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.	Kana uri munhu anosienda panzvimbo inotengeswa svutugadzike, mubuki wesvutugadzike anogona kunge ava kutoziva kuti unotenga rudzi ipi yacho, uye izvi zvinoita kuti munhu anzwe zvakanaka, anodaro anoona chiremba nezvehutano hwemanzwiro nekufunga kwevanhu, Dr. Maria Espinola, uyo ari muzvinafundo mubazi rinodzidzisa zvehutano hwepfungwa nehunhu nemaitiro evanhu reDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience paUniversity of Cincinnati College of Medicine.	If you are a customer of a drug store, the vendor may already know what you are buying, and that makes you feel better, says Dr. Maria Espinola, a professor at the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.
600	It feels good to be recognized, to know that people are expecting you, to know that people care about you, to know that you belong, because the need for belonging and human connection is a fundamental need that we all have, and it's important to have that fulfilled in different ways, Espinola says.	"Espinola anoti, ""Zvinoita kuti munhu anzwe zvakanaka maari kana vanhu vakamuziva kuti ndiani, kuziva kuti vanhu vakakutarisira kuti usvike,  kuziva kuti vanhu vane hanya newe, kuziva kuti unkowo kwaunoti ndekwangu, nekuti chishuvo chekuva nekunonzi nemunhu ndiko kwake kune nekwake vaanoyanana nekudyidzana navo chinhu chakakosha chinodiwa nesu tese zvaedu, uye zvakakosha kuti chazadzikiswa nenzira dzakasiya."""	"Espinola says, ""It makes a person feel good when people know who he is, knowing that people expected him to come, knowing that people care about you, knowing that you are where you say you are, because the desire to be recognized as a person's own is a fundamental desire we all have, and it is important to fulfill it in different ways."""
601	So, places like third places can allow us to do that.	Saka nzvimbo dzakaita dzechitatu dzinotipa mukana wekuita izvi.	However, such places give us the chance to do this.
602	In the past, churches and other houses of worship have been a third place for many Americans.	Munguva dzakadarika, makereke nedzimwe nzvimbo dzekunamatira, dzakange dziri idzo nzvombo dzechitatu kevanhu vazhinji vekuAmerica.	In those days, churches and other religious places were the third most important place in America.
603	In 2019, 67% of people surveyed said they have a third place a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, park or other place in their community that they visit regularly.	Muna 2019, zvikamu zvevanhu makuma matanhatu nevanomwe kubva muzana yevanhu vakataurwa navo mutsvakurudzo vakati vane nzvimbo yechitatu ” iri chitoro chinotengeswa svutugadzike bhawa, nzvimbo inotengeswa chikafu chakabikwa, nzvimbo yeekutandararira ine maruva miti nesora rakachekererwa kana imwewo nzvimbo iri munzvimbo dzavagere dzavanogona kushanyira nguva nenguva..

604	That number dropped to 56% in 2021 a number that could have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.	Hwuwandu uhwu hwakadonha kusvika pavanhu zvikamu makumi mashanu nevatanhu kubva muzana izvo zvaigona kunge zvakonzereswa nedenda redzihwamupengo reCOVID-19.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The number has dropped to fifty-five percent which is likely to be caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
605	What we found was that people who had a third place were much more connected to their community, says Cox. 	"Cox anoti, ' Zvatakaona ndezvekuti vanhu vane nzvimbo yechitatu vakange vaine hukama nekudyidyana munzvimbo dzavanogara. Vane mukana mukuru wekuti vane zvimwewo zvinhu zvavanogona kuita nevamwe munzvimbo idzodzo."""	Cox says, 'What we found was that the third group had a very close relationship with their neighbours. They have a greater chance to do other things with their neighbors in those places.'
606	"""They're much more likely to engage in other activities there."	"Vane mukana mukuru wekuti vane zvimwewo zvinhu zvavanogona kuita nevamwe munzvimbo idzodzo."""	"They have a great chance to do other things with other people in those places."""
607	They are much more trusting of their neighbors. 	Vanonyanya kuvimba nevavakidzani vavo.	They are very dependent on their neighbors.
608	"There's a whole great array of positive social outcomes that were connected to having a third place and for a lot of Americans, it's a coffee shop or a cafe."""	"Pane zvakanaka zvakawanda zvekugarisana nevamwe kunobuda zvakabuda mukuva nenzvimbo yechitatu, uye kuvanhu vazhinji vekuAmerica, inzvimbo inotengeswa svutigadzike yekofi kana yetii"""	"If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. There are many benefits of being in the third place, and for most Americans, it is a place where coffee or tea is sold."""
609	What coffee shops have in their favor is that they can be found almost everywhere, all over the country, and anyone who wants to can stop by regularly.	Chakanakira nzvimbo dzesvutugadzike idzi ndechekuti dzinowakwa kwese kwese munyika yese, uye wese anenge achiida anogona kupfuura nepo paanenge adira nguva nengua.	The advantage of these places is that they are available everywhere in the world, and anyone who wants can go there whenever he wants.
610	And many are open most days of the week.	Nzvimbo zhinji idzi dzinenge dzakavhura mazuva mazhinji esvondo rese.	Many of these sites are open all year round.
611	Cox says even brief coffee shop encounters can increase a sense of belonging.	Cox anoti kunyangwe kusangana kwechinguva chidoko nevamwe muuzvitoro zvesvutugadzike izvi kunowedzera pakuti munhu anzwe kuti ndine vekwangu nenzvimbo yandinogamuchirika.	Cox says that a brief meeting with other customers in these temporary stores increases the sense of being connected with my family and places I'm welcome.
612	I think there's a lot of potential here, and a lot of it is unrealized potential, Cox says.	"Cox anoti, '' Ndinofunga kuti pane mukana wekuita zvakawanda, mukana wekuita zvakawanda usiri kuonekwa nekushandiswa."""	"Cox says, ""I think there is a lot of possibility, a lot of possibility that is not visible or used."""
613	But in terms of what they could do, there's a lot there. 	Asi panyaya yekuti chii chinogona kuitwa, pane zvakawanda zvinogona kuitwa ipapo.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

The ban on traffic does not stop the growth of mosquitoes in the body of children to protect and protect their health?
675	Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.	Dzimwe nyanzvi dzezvehutano dzaratidza kushushikana zvikuru kuti matanho akatorwa ekudzivirira kupararira kwedenda reCovid-19 zvakaita sekufukidza muromo nejira uye kudzidza kwevana vari kudzimba vachishandisa mapotonjere kunogona kunge kwava kuderedza simba nehuwandu hwemasoja ari mumiviri yevana kuti arwise zvirwere zvinogona kuvabata nekuti izvi zvose zvavakuita kuti vana vasabatwe nezvirwere zvinongosibata vana vechidiki pakukura kwavo.	Some health experts are concerned that the measures taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic such as covering the mouth with a bandage and teaching children to sit down with a ventilator may have been a reduction in the amount of immune system cells in children's bodies to protect them from potentially dangerous diseases because these actions all ensure that children are safe from infections that can spread to young children.
676	There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things, says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.

If you can't translate simply say you don't know There are many reasons why we believe children should be exposed to diseases to keep their immune system strong and healthy, so that if they get a serious illness they can quickly become immune to the disease and fight it, says Sara Sawyer, a professor of physiology and neurobiology at the University of Colorado Boulder.
677	At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.

681	So, some people would argue that childhood illnesses, like colds and stomach bugs, build our immunity so that when more dangerous things come along, we're prepared and we don't get as sick from those more dangerous things.	Saka, vamwe vanogona kuzoti zvirwere zvevana vadiki, zvakaita sedzihwa nemudumbu, zvinovaka masoja anotidzivirira kuitira kuti kana zvimwe zvhinhu zvine njodzi zvikazouya, tinenge takagadzirira uye hatizonyanye kurwara nekuda kwezvinhu izvi zvine njodzi.	However, some may say that children's diseases, such as diarrhea and diarrhea, build a defense system so that if other dangerous things come, we will be prepared and we won't be sick from these dangerous things.
682	Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.	Kunyangwe denda redzihwamupengo iri risati ravapo, humbowo hwakabuda mukuongorora nzira dzinopararira nadzo zvirwere hwaiita sekuratidza kuti vana vari munyika dzakabudirira kudarika dzimwe, uko kuno nyanyoshandiswa sipo dzekugezesa maoko nemishonga inouraya hutachiona hwemumaoko, vanogona kuva nemasoja emumuviri asina kukura nekusimba zvichienzaniswa nevana vari munyika dzichiri kubudirira, avo vanosangana nehutachiona hunokonzera zvirwere, twumbuyu, matenda nezkusagadzikana kwehutano.	Although the fever is still unknown, findings from the investigation of spreading diseases suggest that children in developed countries, where soaps and antiseptics are commonly used, can have a weaker immune system compared to children in developing countries, who are more likely to be exposed to infections, bacteria, diseases and physical discomfort.
683	"This makes kids in more industrialized countries more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases, according to whats known as the ""hygiene hypothesis."""	"Izvi zvinoita kuti vana vari munyika vakabudirira kudarika dzimwe vave panjodzi yekubata zvirwere zvinobva pakuti miviri yavo inenge isisagone kuzvivakira masoja anodzivirira hutrano hwavo, zvichienderana nezvinodaidzwa zvichinzi ""fungidziro inoshandiswa patsvakurudzo dzezvehutsanana."""	"This makes children in countries where they are more successful in developing countries more vulnerable to developing diseases because their body cannot carry out their own immune system protection, according to what is called ""the theory used in genetic testing."""
684	The hygiene hypothesis is actually quite controversial because it's thought that our exposure to microbes isn't the only factor, says Cody Warren, a virologist and immunologist who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder.

If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
685	A lot of this could also be dictated by genetics, diet, and the environment that we live in. 	Zvizhinji izvi zvinobva panhodzera dzezvatinowana kubva kuvabereki vedu, zvatinodya uye nharaunda dzatinogara madziri.	Many of these depend on what we get from our parents, what we eat and where we live.
686	That also shapes our immune system's a real multifactorial thing that we can't fully account for just by wearing masks.

Iyi inyaya ine mativi mazhinji chose zvatisingagone kungotsanangura nekuti tawana zviputiro zvemachira zvemhino nemiromo kuti tisafeme mhepo ine hutachona.	This also includes the functions of our body to protect us from diseases. This is a very complex issue that we cannot simply explain because we have a combination of facial and mouth coverings to protect us from the humidity of the air.

""One of the most important things you can do is just to stay up to date on vaccines."

693	But also, equally important is making sure our children have a good diet and they regulate stress.  	Asi zvakanyanyawo kukosha kuona kuti vana vedu vari kudya chikafu chakanaka chinovaka muviri uye nekuona kuti vane nzira dzavanadzo dzekubvisa zvingavashungurudze mupfungwa nendangariro.	But it's even more important to see that our children are eating healthy foods and to see that they have ways to get rid of things that distract them from their thoughts and memory.
694	It's been well documented that both of those having a good diet, a less stressful environment can have a positive impact on our immune system.

It is shown by written evidence that having a good diet, living in a safe environment can have a good effect on our immune system, protecting our body from diseases.
695	Once public health officials say masks are no longer necessary, Sawyer thinks pointing out the positives of putting our masks away could reassure hesitant parents who worry about their children getting sick.

696	Maybe we should have a public conversation about the possible reasons to take that mask off, if they are in school, and get back to the normal repertoire of relatively safe childhood illnesses, she says.	Zvichida, tinofanirwa kuti tiite nhaurirano pajikerere neveruzhinji pamusoro pezvikonzero zvekuti sei tichifanirwa kuchibvisa zviputiro zvemhino nemiromo, kana zvichiri kushandiswa muzvikoro, tobva tadzokera hedu kutsika dzedu dzamazuva ose ezvatinoita nezvirwere zvevana zvisina njodzi yakanyanya kuhutano hwavo, anodaro.	If not, we should have a public debate on why we should remove mouthwashes, if they are still used in schools, and return to our everyday practices of treating children with less harmful diseases, he says.
697	The plus side of childhood illnesses is that they can build up that hornet's nest of immunity that could protect kids against new things that then come along.

The bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in the city of Nuevo Laredo said on Monday that the shelters for foreigners had been filled with other foreigners who were living outside the churches.
738	Bishop Enrique Sanchez Martanez said migrants started streaming into Nuevo Laredo in late April, though the city isn't usually popular among migrants, in part because it is dominated by the violent Northeast drug cartel.

But a judge in Louisiana ruled that the government could not start to enforce the law before the end of its term.
744	The (Mexican) immigration officials organized things with the shelters, and the plan was to send people who had been waiting a long time, without any checks, basically anyone, Ajic said.

763	According to the USCIS, most of the announced changes simply restore options offered before the Trump administration's slowdown of USCIS processing and before the COVID-19 pandemic further slowed the agency's resources.

The COVID-19 pandemic has added to these problems in 2020, because of the suspension of benefits and the problem of workers taking vacations from work, which has increased the sickness of workers and reduced the ability to work.
766	In 2021, before USCIS could recover from these fiscal and operational impacts, there was a sudden and dramatic increase in EAD (Employment Authorization Document) initial and renewal filings, according to the USCIS statement.

The World Bank's President Robert Zoellick said that using a few dollars and a few instruments to help girls is absolutely unacceptable.

He also added that teaching girls helps families living in poverty, saying that each year a child is sent to higher school will help girls to earn between ten and twenty percent more money.
894	If they earn greater income they also have greater access to reproductive health information and services, so then more likely to delay marriage and childbirth, have healthier babies and attain higher literacy rates, Zoellick said.	"Zoellick akati, ""Kana vakatambira muhoro wakakura vanengewo vogona kuwana ruzivi pamuso pezvehutano hwavo maringe nekubereka vana nemitezo yavo sevanhukadzi nezvinogona nekwanogona kubatsirwa, saka naizvozvo vanenge vogonawo kunonoka kuroorwa nekuita vana, vozova nevana vane hutano huri nani uye vowanazve goneso yepamusoro pakugona kuverenga nekunzwisisa zvinyorwa nezvitaurwa."	If they get a greater amount of freedom, they can also get a better understanding of their health and their ability to bear children and their ability to carry out their roles as women and their ability to be supported, so they can also delay marriage and having children, foster healthy children and gain a higher level of literacy and understanding of texts and arguments.
895	The evidence strongly suggests that investing in adolescent girls is a key way to break inter-generational patterns of poverty.

Bihamba said the Congolese troops should be paid their salaries in bank accounts rather than being handed over to their commanders to accept them.
939	Bihamba said with the current system they receive only about a third of their salary, which causes some soldiers to loot and rape.	Bihamba akati nenzira iri kushandiswa ikezvino, mauto anongogamuchira chikamu chimwe chete kubva muzvitatu chemihoro yavo, zvinozoita kuti mamwe mauto abe nekubvuta zvinhu zvevanhu nekubata chibharo.	Bihamba said that with the current system, the troops only receive one-third of their income, which will allow some troops to steal and kidnapping people.
940	She also called for an international tribunal for the Congo to help end general impunity, as well as more local tribunals for raped victims to seek justice.

Iri ranga riri gore rizere kugujurwa sezvo tichiine mazvimbiswa eCashgate iyo yakasiya yakuvadza zvehupfumi hwenyika.	This was a year of corruption because we had promised to avoid the consequences of the Cashgate scandal that left us with a huge economic loss.
991	We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals. 	Takaona kuti kazhinji kacho mapazi akakosha nemapoka anoita basa risingagone kusavapo ndiwo akanyanya kukanganiswa, semuenzaniso iye zvino hatichina mishonga inoringana muzvipatara.

992	In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time, said Mwanyungwe.	Muzvikoro, mari dzemihoro yevadzidzisi haisikusvika nenguva, akadaro Mwanyungwe.	In the schools, the wages of the teachers are not being paid on time, said Mwanyungwe.
993	Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay.	Mwanyungwe akabatanidza Cashgate nekudonha kwehukoshi hwemari yemuMalawi, inonzi kwacha, izvo zvakonzera kuramwa mabasa kwevashandi vehurumende vari kuda mihoro yepamusoro.	The committee linked Cashgate to the collapse of the Malawian monetary system, known as kwacha, which led to the suspension of government workers who wanted higher wages.
994	For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money.	Semuyenzaniso, vashandi vanotsigira mune zvemutemo vanga vachiramwa mabasa kwemasvondo matanhatu, vachida kuti mihoro yavo iwezderwe nezvikamu makumi mana nezvishanu kubva muzana iyo hurumende iri kuti haikwanise kuvapa nekuti haina mari.	For example, lawyers have been without work for six weeks, demanding that their wages be reduced by twenty-five percent, which the government says it cannot give them because it doesn't have money.
995	Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return.	Vashandi vanoshanda mubazi rinorwisana nehuori muMalawi reAnti-Corruption Bureauvakaramwa mabasa vachida kuwedzerwa mihoro yavo nezvikamu makumi manomwe kubva muzana kusvikira hurumende yavatyisidzira nekuvatorera mari dzavo dzemihoro wemwedzi waZvita kana vasina kudzokera kubasa.

996	Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances.	Mwanyungwe akati hurumende inogona koga kunzvenga kumwe kuramwa kwemabasa nevashandi kana ikagona kuwanazve kuvimbika mumeso emasangano anobatsira nemari mumashandisiro ayinoita mari dzinofanirwa kuita mabasa anobatsira ruzhinji.	The committee said the government could avoid further strikes by workers if it can regain trust in the eyes of the aid agencies in their use of money to do useful work.
997	My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, we may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation, said Mwanyungwe.	Chinondityisa ndechekuti kana tikasagona kugutsa vanotibatsira nemari nemari iyi ikasadzoka ichipindazve munezvehupfumi hwenyika, zvinogona kumanikidza hurumende kuti ikwerete mari kubva kumasangano emuno izvo zvinozoita kuti mari yemuno ishaye simba ukuwo mitengo yezvinhu ichikwrira, nekudhura kwemari ingakweretwe mumabhanga, yongova nyatwa yekunzi zindakupa zindakutorera, akadaro Mwanyungwe.	If we cannot reach the donors and the money doesn't return to the economy, it can force the government to borrow money from the foreign parties which will weaken the local currency and increase the cost of goods, and the cost of lending to banks, which will be a threat to the economy, said Mwanyungwe.
998	The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system.	Masangano anobatsira nemari vari kuda, pamusoro pezvimwe zvinhu, kusungwa kweavo vese vari munyaya yehuori iyi, uye kusimbiswa hwehurongwa nehwaro hwekushandiswa kwemari yehurumende.

1004	Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013.	VaMutharika vakatiwo hurumende yavo yatanga kushandisa nzira itsva dzekuvandudza mashandisirwo anoitwa mari yebasa rehurumende izvo zvinoedza kukurisa zvehupfumu hwenyika nezvikamu zvisahnu nechidimbu kubva muzana muna 2014, pachiratidza kukwira kubva pazvikamu zvishanu chete kubva muzana muna 2013.	However, Mr. Mugabe said the government began to use new ways to improve the use of government spending which aims to increase the percentage of religious activity in the country by 6% in 2014, up from 6% in 2013.
