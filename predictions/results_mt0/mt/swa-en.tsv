1	The Nigerian government announced Friday it was suspending Twitter in the country, just days after Twitter deleted a harmful tweet by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari that suggested the state would use violence against the Igbo ethnic group.	Serikali ya Naijeria imetangaza siku ya Ijumaa kwamba inaufungia mtandao wa Twita nchini humo, siku kadhaa baada ya mtandao huo kufuta twiti hatari iliyoandikwa na Rais wa Naijeria Muhammadu Buhari iliyodai kwamba serikali itatumia nguvu dhidi ya kabila la Igbo.	The Nigerian government announced on Friday that it is shutting down Twitter in the country, days after the site deleted a threatening tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari that claimed that the government would use force against the Igbo people.
2	Despite removing the tweet, the message continues to circulate on social media, bringing up painful memories of a civil war that left more than one million dead.	Pamoja na kuondolewa kwa twiti hiyo, ujumbe uliendea kusambaa kwenye mitandao ya kijamii, hali iliyokumbushia maumivu ya vita vya wenyewe kwa wenyewe vilivyopoteza maisha ya watu zaidi ya milioni moja.	With the removal of the tweet, the message continued to spread on social media, which reminded us of the pain of the civil war that killed more than one million people.
3	But the tweet also sparked a movement on social media in support of Nigerians from the Igbo ethnic group.	Lakini twiti hiyo ilichochea harakati kwenye mitandao ya kijamii kusimama na Wanaijeria wa kabila la Igbo.	But the tweet inspired a movement on social media to stand up for the Iranian people.
4	In a series of tweets posted on June 1, 2021, Buhari threatened to treat Nigerians from the eastern part of the country in the language they understand, in a reference to Nigerias 1967-1970 civil war against the secessionist Republic of Biafra, in southeastern Nigeria.	Kwenye mfululizo wa twiti zilizochapishwa mnamo June 1, 2021, Buhari anatishia kuwashughulikia Wanaijeria wanaotoka kwenye sehemu ya mashariki ya nchi hiyo kwa kutumia lugha wanayoielewa, akirejea vita vya wenyewe kwa wenyewe nchini Naijeria kati ya mwaka 1967-1970 dhidi ya vuguvugu la kujitenga la Jamhuri ya Biafra, kusini mashariki mwa Naijeria.	In a series of tweets published on June 1, 2021, Buhari threatens to punish Nigerians from the eastern part of the country with their own language, referring to the 1967-1970 ethnic conflict between Nigeria and the Biafra nationalist movement in south-east Nigeria.
5	The tweets came after a series of attacks on government and security installations in the region, which have been blamed on an armed group linked to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a pro-Biafra secessionist movement.	Twiti hiyo iliandikwa baada ya mfululizo wa mashambulio dhidi ya serikali na vyombo vya usalama kwenye eneo hilo, ambalo linalaumiwa kuwa na kikundi cha kijeshi  kinachohusishwa na Wenyeji wa Biafra (IPOB), vuguvugu la watu wanaotaka sehemu ya Biafra ijitenge.	The tweet was written after a series of attacks on government and security forces in the area, which is alleged to be linked to the Biafra Residents' Organisation (IPOB), a movement of people who want to separate the Biafra region.
6	IPOB denied involvement in the attack, says the Voice of America.	Kikundi hicho kimekanusha kuhusika na mashambulizi hayo, kwa mujibu wa Sauti ya Amerika.	The group has denied involvement in the attack, according to the United States Broadcasting System.
7	Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War, Buharis now-deleted tweet said:	Wengi wa wale wanaoonesha utovu wa nidhamu leo walikuwa wadogo kuelewa uharibifu na upotevu wa maisha ya watu uliotokea wakati wa Mapigano ya Wenyewe kwa Wenyewe nchini Naijeria, ilisema twiti ya Buhari ambayo sasa imefutwa:	Many of those who show their arrogance today were young to understand the damage and loss of lives that happened during the Nigerian Civil War, a tweet from Buhari that has been deleted.

9	The tweets reiterated comments made by a visibly irritated Buhari in the State House, Nigerias capital Abuja, about the wave of arson attacks on electoral officers.	Twiti zilizojibu mapigo kwa matamshi hayo yaliyotolewa na Buhari aliyeonekana dhahiri kuwa na hasira akiwa katika Ikulu ya nchi hiyo, makao makuu ya nchi, Abuja, kuhusu mwelekeo wa mashambulizi dhidi ya maafisa wa uchaguzi.

11	They have made their case, they just wanted to destroy the country, he said, appearing to reference secessionist agitators:	Wamesema walichokitaka, lakini sasa wanataka kuiangamiza nchi, alisema, akionekana kuwazungumzia watu hao wanaotaka kujitenga:	They said what they wanted, but now they want to destroy the country, he said, apparently referring to those who want to separate:

14	The brutal civil war led to the death of over one million ethnic Igbos and other Easterners, according to Chima J. Korieh, a professor of African History at United States Marquette University.	Vita hivyo vibaya vilisababisha vifo vya zaidi ya watu milioni wa kabila la Igbo na wakazi wengine wa ukanda wa Mashariki, kwa mujibu wa Chima J. Korieh, profesa wa Historia ya Afrika kwenye Chuo Kikuu cha Marquette nchini Marekani.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
15	For most Nigerians, the war over the breakaway state of Biafra is generally regarded as an unfortunate episode best forgotten, but for the Igbo people who fought for secession, it remains a life-defining event, asserts Nigerian writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani.	Kwa Wanaijeria wengi, vita vya kujitenga kwa jimbo la Biafra, kwa ujumla, huchukuliwa kama tukio la baya la kusahauliwa, lakini kwa watu wa Igbo waliopambana kujitenga, linabaki kuwa tukuo lililobadili maana ya maisha yao, anasema mwandishi wa Naijeria Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani.

21	Deleted abusive tweets are still visible	Twiti zenye vitisho bado zinaonekana mtandaoni	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
22	An investigation by the social media forensic expert Digital Africa Research Lab (DigiAfricaLab) reveals that Buharis abusive tweet is still visible across numerous timelines two days after it was deleted by Twitter, due to Quote Tweets:	Uchunguzi uliofanywa na mtaalam wa mtandao ya kijamii wa Digital Africa Research Lab (DigiAfricaLab) unaonesha kwamba twiti ya vitisho iliyoandikwa na Buhari bado inaonekana kwenye akaunti kadhaa siku mbili baada ya kuwa imefutwa na Twita, shauri ya kunukuliwa na watumiaji wengine:	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

More than 30 hours after Twitter deleted the tweet of Nigerian President @MBuhari for violating the law, the tweet that was deleted is still visible on many social media accounts because of the leak!
24	Signing onto different accounts through different devices, DigiAfricaLab was still able to view the more than 17,000 quoted tweets made by users before the social media company pulled down the offensive tweets from the timelines of @MBuhari and @NGRPresident, both verified Twitter handles of President Buhari.	Kwa kuingia mtandao kwa kutumia akaunti tofauti kupitia vifaa tofauti, DigiAfricaLab iliweza kuona zaidi ya twiti 17,000 zilizonukuliwa na watumiaji kabla kampuni hiyo ya mtandao wa kijamii haijaifuta twiti hiyo kutoka kwenye akaunti ya @MBuhari na @NGRPresident, zote zikiwa ni anuani za twita zilizohakikiwa zinazotumika na Rais Buhari.

25	Furthermore, DigiAfricaLab was able to click and expand President Buharis deleted tweet.	Zaidi ya hayo, DigiAfricaLab iliweza kubofya na kukuza twiti ya Rais Buhari iliypfutwa.	Moreover, DigiAfricaLab could analyze and optimize the tweet of President Buhari.
26	Deleted tweets may still be visible to Twitter users because Twitter's software, also called, Application Programming Interface (API) relies on third-party applications that connect to Twitter servers via a URL.	Twiti zil nizofutwa zinaweza kuendelea kuonekana kwa watumiaji wa mtandao wa twita kwa sababu zana inayotumiwa na Twita (API) hutegemea zana za mitandao mingine inayounganisha kazi data za Twita kwa kupitia URL.	If you cannot translate the tweets, just say you don't know. If you cannot translate the tweets, just say you don't know.
27	Another reason, according to J. D. Biersdorfer of New York Times, was that deleted tweets may still be cached away and therefore available to show up in search results  until the site goes indexing again and updates itself with a fresh copy of your Twitter profile and posts.	Sababu nyingine, kwa mujibu wa  J. D. Biersdorfer wa New York Times, ni kwamba twiti zilizofutwa zinaweza kuwa bado zinapatikana na hivyo kuonekana kwenye matokeo ya utafutaji mtandaoni  mpaka tovuti ihuishwe na nakala mpya ya twiti kwenye ukurasa mkuu wa akaunti husika.	Other reasons, according to J. D. Biersdorfer of the New York Times, are that deleted tweets can still be found and therefore appear in search results on the Internet until the website is deleted and a new tweet published on the main page of the account.

56	Although the trio was fired by the radio station, it brought to the fore how hostile the Kenyan online space has become for women.

97	An article by The Elephant, one of Kenyas foremost digital publications, noted that online social network spheres in Kenya and globally have turned to be the frontiers for toxic expressions and harassment.	Makala ya The Elephant,  moja ya chapisho kuu la kidijitali nchini Kenya, ilibaini kuwa nyanja za mtandao wa kijamii mkondoni nchini Kenya na ulimwenguni zimegeuka kuwa mipaka ya maneno yenye sumu na unyanyasaji.	The Elephant, one of the most influential digital publications in Kenya, found that social media channels in Kenya and across the world have become a border for toxic and abusive words.
98	There is no gainsaying that social media has become an important tool for social and professional advancement, more so for women.	Hakuna ubishi kwamba mitandao ya kijamii imekuwa nyenzo muhimu kwa maendeleo ya kijamii na kitaalam, zaidi kwa wanawake.

109	Caribbean nations have, one by one, been readjusting their law books to reflect greater equity for LGBTQ+ people by decriminalising colonial-era sodomy clauses.	Nchi za Caribiani, moja baada ya nyingine, zimekuwa zikirekebisha vitabu vyake vya sheria kuakisi usawa zaidi kwa watu wenye kupenda mapenzi ya jinsia moja kwa kuondoa vipengele vya enzi za ukoloni vilivyokuwa vinazuia tabia ya kuingiliana kinyume na maumbile.	Caribbean countries, one after another, have been changing their laws to ensure more equality for people who love one another by removing the colonial elements that prevented a desire to have sex against nature.
110	In 2016, it was Belize.	Mwaka 2016, ilianza nchi ya Belize.	In 2016, it began in Belize.
111	Two years later, Trinidad and Tobago followed suit, but the ripple effect of dismantling connected pieces of legislation has been slower in coming.	Miaka miwili baadae, Trinidad na Tobago ikafuatia, ingawa hatua yake hiyo haijatafsirika kwenye mabadiliko ya sheria.	Two years later, Trinidad and Tobago followed, though its action was not translated into a constitutional change.
112	Three years after the court deemed the country's buggery laws unconstitutional, Trinidad and Tobago's Equal Opportunity Act (EOA) finally looks set to amend its regulations pertaining to sexual orientation.	Miaka mitatu baada ya mahakama kutamka wazi kwamba sheria hizo zinakwenda kinyume na katiba, hatimaye Trinadad na Tobago inaonekana iko njiani kurekebisha kanuni za Sheria ya Fursa Sawa (EOA) zinazohusiana na ushoga.	Three years after the court clearly ruled that these laws were against the constitution, finally, Trinadad and Tobago appears to be moving to amend the Equal Opportunity Act (EOA) related to gay marriage.
113	The Act's self-proclaimed purpose is to prohibit certain kinds of discrimination and promote equality of opportunity between persons of different status.	Sheria hiyo ina lengo linalosomekana kama, kuzuia aina fulani za ubaguzi na kukuza usawa wa fursa baina ya watu wenye hali tofauti.	The law has a objective that is viewed as, to prevent some forms of discrimination and to promote equal opportunity between people of different backgrounds.
114	To this end, an Equal Opportunity Commission and an Equal Opportunity Tribunal were established to handle such issues but so far, neither body has been unable to deal with matters of discrimination based on sexual orientation.	Kwa minajili ya lengo hiyo,  Tume ya Fursa na Mahakama ya Fursa Sawa zilianzishwa ili kushughulikia masuala hayo lakini mpaka sasa, vyombo hivyo vinashindwa kushughulikia masuala ya ubaguzi dhidi ya ushoga.	For that reason, the Equal Opportunity Commission and the Equal Rights Court were established to deal with the issue but until now, these bodies have failed to deal with the issue of prejudice against homosexuality.
115	The current laws only cover discrimination based on sex, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, marital status, or disability in matters of employment, training, education, and the like.	Sheria zilizopo zinashughulikia ubaguzi wa kijinsia, rangi, kabila, asili, dini, hali ya ndoa, au ulemavu kwenye masuala ya ajira, mafunzo, elimu na kadhalika.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. The existing laws relate to racial, sex, race, ethnicity, religion, marriage status, or disability in the employment, training, education and so on.
116	Pressure to amend the current Act mounted after Scotiabank Trinidad and Tobago announced on April 14 that it would extend its health benefits to the partners of employees in same-sex relationships, in the same way it already offered access to the common-law partners of heterosexual employees.	Shinikizo la kurekebisha Sheria ya sasa liliongezeka baada ya Benki ya Scotiabank nchini Trinidad na Tobago kutangaza mnamo Aprili 14 kwamba itapanua wigo wa huduma za afya kwa wenzi wa waajiriwa walio kwenye mahusiano ya jinsia moja, kwa namna ile ile ilivyo kwa wenzi wa waajiriwa wa jinsia tofauti.	The pressure to amend the current law rose after Scotiabank in Trinidad and Tobago announced on April 14 that it would extend health insurance for partners in same sex relationships, just as it would extend for partners in other sex relationships.
117	The announcement sparked a nationwide conversation and was praised by the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) and Ian Roach, chairman of the Equal Opportunity Commission, who noted in an interview with the Trinidad and Tobago Newsday:	Tangazo hilo liliibua majadiliano makali nchini humo na pia kupongezwa na Chemba ya Biashara ya Marekani (AMCHAM) na Ian Roach, mwenyekiti wa Tume ya Fursa Sawa, aliyenukuliwa katika majadiliano yake na gazeti la Newsday la Trinidad na Tobago akisema:	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
118	It is a good move on the part of the private sector and especially by the bank, who has a wide cross-section of employees.	Ni hatua nzuri kwa upande wa sekta binafsi na hasa kwa benki, ambayo ina waajiriwa wa aina mbalimbali.	It is a good step for the private sector and especially for the bank, which has a wide variety of employees.
119	It is important that the others should follow suit, past what the law insists.	Ni muhimu na wengine wakaiga hatua hii, pamoja na kile ambacho sheria inasisitiza.	It is important that others follow this step, along with what the law stresses.
120	Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi has said he is encouraged by Scotiabank's inclusive initiative and remains open to doing what is necessary to address the spectrums of discrimination that exist.	Mwanasheria Mkuu wa Serikali Faris Al-Rawi amesema ametiwa moyo na hatua hiyo ya Benki ya Scotiabank kulinda haki za watu na kwamba milango iko wazi kufanya kile kinachohitajika ili kuondoa aina mbalimbali za ubaguzi unaoendelea kuwepo nchini humo.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
121	Al-Rawi's stance is markedly different from his position after the 2018 High Court ruling; soon after the unconstitutional verdict was handed down, the state announced its intention to appeal.	Msimamo huo wa Al-Rawi unaonekana kubadilika kulingana na msimamo aliokuwa nao baada ya Hukumu ya Mahakama Kuu ya 2018; mara tu baada ya uamuzi usio wa kikatiba kutolewa, serikali ilitangaza nia yake ya kukata rufaa.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. The position of Al-Rawi appears to have changed since the 2018 High Court ruling; just after the unconstitutional ruling was announced, the government announced its intention to appeal.
122	While Trinidad and Tobago has undeniably made great strides when it comes to discrimination for members of the local LGBTQ+ community, homophobiamuch of it rationalised on religious groundsstill exists.	Wakati Trinidad na Tobago zimefanya maendeleo makubwa kwenye kuondoa aina mbalimbali za ubaguzi, lakini linapokuja suala la ubaguzi dhidi ya mashoga wa nchi hiyo, hofu ya mashogakwa kutumia hoja za kidinibado hali haijabadilika sana.	While Trinidad and Tobago have made significant progress in abolishing various forms of discrimination, when it comes to discrimination against gays in the country, the fear of gays using religious arguments still remains.
123	Public reactions to Scotiabank's announcement on social media networking platforms like Facebook were met with lots of criticism.	Kwa kutazama mwitikio wa wananchi dhidi ya tangazo la Benki ya Scotiabank kwenye majukwaa ya mitandao ya kijamii kama Facebook upinzani ulikuwa mkubwa.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
124	Meanwhile, LGBTQ+ people continue to face not just discrimination, but acts of violence, many of them ending fatally.	Wakati huo huo, mashoga wanaendelea si tu kukabiliana na ubaguzi, lakini pia vitendo vya ukatili, vingi vikiishia kwa kupoteza maisha.	While the same goes for gays, they continue to face not only prejudice, but also violence, often ending in death.
125	Most recently, the murder of Marcus Anthony Singh, a member of the local LGBTQ+ community, sparked online conversations about the reality that many LGBTQ+ people face in terms of both security and discriminatory practices.	Katika tukio la hivi karibuni,  kifo cha Marcus Anthony Singh, mwanachama wa chama cha mashoga kwenye eneo analoishi, kiliibua mjadala mzito mtandao kuhusu mazingira magumu ambayo mashoga wanakabiliana nayo hususani usalama wao sambamba na vitendo vya ubaguzi.	In the recent case, the death of Marcus Anthony Singh, a gay activist in his neighborhood, sparked a debate on the internet about the difficulties faced by gays, particularly their safety and their persecution.
126	Many of those conversations have been happening on Twitter Spaces, which provide an audio-only chat forum for safe discussion and education.	Mazungumzo hayo mengi yamekuwa yakifanyika kupitia teknolojia ya Twitter Spaces, jukwaa la mazungumzo ya sauti linalowezesha mijadala na elimu salama.	Many of these conversations have been conducted through the technology of Twitter Spaces, a voice chat platform that allows discussions and safe education.
127	While Attorney General Al Rawi has not provided a timeline by which the amendments to the legislation will be tackled, for the LGBTQ+ community and its allies, the hope remains that moves by private sector companies like Scotiabank will soon be followed by the government, eventually leading to societal change.	Wakati Mwanasheria Mkuu wa Serikali Al Rawi hajatoa muda rasmi wa kufanyika mabadiliko hayo ya sheria, kwa mashoga na washirika wao, matumaini yanabaki kwamba huenda hatua zinazochukuliwa na makampuni binafsi kama Benki ya Scotiabank si muda mrefu zitaanza kuchukuliwa na serikali, na hatimaye kuleta mabadiliko yenye sura ya jamii nzima.	While the Attorney General Al Rawi has not given a formal timeframe for the changes to the laws, for gays and their partners, hope remains that the actions taken by private companies such as Scotiabank in the short term will be taken by the government, and eventually bring about a change that would have a positive impact on the whole society.

130	For internet and technology companies, collecting user data remains one of their main sources of income.	Kwa kampuni za mtandao wa intaneti na teknolojia, ukusanyaji wa taarifa za watumiaji wa mtandao wa intaneti umekuwa ni chanzo chao kikuu cha kujipatia kipato.	For internet companies and technology companies, the collection of Internet users' information has become a major source of income.
131	But this business model includes a security risk for users, as demonstrated by recurring cases of undisclosed commercial use, massive leaks, and hacking incidents.	Hata hivyo, namna hii ya kujipatia kipato inawaweka hatarini watumiaji kama inavyojidhihirisha katika matukio ya mara kwa mara ya uwekaji wazi wa taarifa za kibiashara, uvujaji mkubwa wa taarifa na udukuaji.	But this way of earning money is dangerous to users as it shows in frequent cases of being exposed to corporate information, massive leakages of information, and illegal exploitation.
132	Is there a credible solution for strengthening users privacy?	Je, kuna njia muafaka ya kuboresha haki ya faragha ya watumiaji wa mtandao wa intaneti?	Is there a way to improve the privacy of Internet users?
133	Companies such as Google and Apple focus on collecting daily user data, mostly via smartphones, and combining information from the applications running over time: the user's contacts and agenda, for example.	Kampuni kama vile Google na Apple zimewekeza nguvu kukusanya kila siku taarifa za wateja wao, haswa kupitia simu za mkononi, na muunganiko wa vitumizi mbalimbali vinavyotumiwa mara kwa mara kama vile kalenda na ajenda.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
134	A multitude of apps track the user's location in real time, while health and sports apps dig deep into their biometric information.	Vitumizi kadha wa kadha vimekuwa vikifuatilia mahali halisi mtu alipo, na kwa upande mwingine vitumizi vya masuala ya afya na michezo vikijikita katika kukusanya taarifa za vinasaba vya wateja.	Many applications have been tracking where the person is, and on the other hand, health and sports applications have been focused on collecting customer genetic data.
135	This data is collected and analyzed, allegedly to offer more tailored and sophisticated services.	Inaaminika kuwa, taarifa hizi zinakusanywa na kuchanganuliwa kwa lengo la kumrahisishia na kumpatia mtumiaji kile anachokihitaji kwa haraka.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
136	In fact, most users do not realize they are offering a wealth of data to service providers and platform owners, free of charge.	Hata hivyo, ukweli ni kwamba, watumiaji wa intaneti na vitumizi vya kiteknolojia hawafahamu kuwa, wanatoa taarifa zao bure bila ya malipo yoyote.	But the truth is that Internet users and technological users do not know that they are giving their information free of charge.
137	Privacy activists, such as Austrian Max Schrems, have expressed strong concerns about this model.	Wanaharakati wa masuala ya sera ya faragha ya mtandaoni kama vile  Raia wa Austria, Max Schrems,  ameonesha hisia zake kuhusu utaratibu huu wa kampuni za intaneti na vitumizi vya teknolojia wa kujipatia kipato kupitia taarifa za wateja wao.

138	They highlight the risks of increasingly frequent privacy violations and abuses.	Anaangazia hatari ya ongeseko la matukio ya mara kwa mara ya unyanyasaji na ukiukwaji wa sheria ya haki ya faragha.	He highlights the danger of repeated cases of abuse and illegal exploitation of privacy laws.
139	This was perhaps best illustrated by the Facebook scandal known as the Cambridge Analytica case  in which British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users without consent, in order to provide analytical assistance to the 2016 presidential campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.	Moja ya matukio kama haya pengine yameelezwa vizuri sana kupitia tukio la skendo ya Facebook linalofahamika kama kesi ya Cambridge Analytica ambapo Taasisi binafsi ya ushauri ya Cambridge Analytica ilijikusanyia taarifa binafsi za watumiaji milioni 87 wa Facebook bila idhini yao kwa lengo la  kuwasaidia wagombea kiti cha Urais Ted Cruz na Donald Trump mapema mwaka 2016.	One of these cases may be best explained by the Facebook scandal known as the Cambridge Analytica case where a private consultancy collected 87 million Facebook users' personal information without their consent to help Democratic presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump in 2016.
140	Schrems says he warned Facebook representatives about the data-mining activities of Cambridge Analytica, but could not convince them to act:	Schrems anasema kuwa aliwatahadharisha wawakilishi wa Facebook kuhusu matukio ya ukusanyaji taarifa za wateja wao uliokuwa unafanywa na taasisi ya Cambridge Analytica, na hata hivyo, hakuweza kuwashawishi kuchukua hatua:	Schrems says he warned Facebook representatives about the cases of their customers' data collection by the Cambridge Analytica organization, but he could not persuade them to take action:
141	They [Facebook representatives] explicitly said that in their view, by using the platform you consent to a situation where other people can install an app and gather your data.	Wawakilishi wa Facebook bila kumumunya maneno walisema kuwa kwa maoni yao, unapotumia jukwaa la mmiliki fulani unakuwa umeruhusu watu hao wapakie vitumizi vyao [kwenye simu za mkononi na vifaa vingine] kwa ajili ya kukusanya taarifa za mtumiaji.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. Facebook representatives without a doubt said that in their opinion, when you use a particular owner's platform, you are allowing those users to download their own applications [on mobile devices and other devices] to collect user data.
142	But why would you care about privacy if you have nothing to hide, after all?	Hata hivyo, ni kwa nini ujiulize kuhusu haki ya faragha mtandaoni ilhali huna chochote cha kuficha?	But why should you ask about privacy on the internet when you have nothing to hide?
143	Whistleblower Edward Snowden answered this question in a Reddit discussion in 2015:	Mwanaharakati Edward Snowden alikuwa na majibu ya swali hili  katika mjadala wa mtandao wa Reddit mwaka 2015:	The activist Edward Snowden answered this question in a 2015 Reddit forum:
144	Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.	Kufikiri kuwa hujali chochote kuhusu haki ya faragha mtandaoni kwa kuwa huna cha kuficha ni sawa na kufikiri kuwa hujali chochote kuhusu haki ya kujieleza kwa kuwa huna chochote cha kusema.

Global Voices iliongea naye ili kufahamu namna teknolojia ya habari inavyoathiri maisha ya watu, fursa zilizopo na madhara yake.	Global Voices spoke to him to understand how technology affects people's lives, the possibilities and the effects.
149	Here is his view on the evolution of such technology:	Huu hapa ni mtazamo wake kuhusu maendeleo ya teknolojia hii ya habari:	Here is his view on the development of this technology:
150	This is a philosophical question.	Hili ni swali la kifalsafa.	This is a philosophical question.
151	I personally have very mixed feelings about it because I've always been passionate about technology.	Binafsi nina hisia  mchanganyiko haswa kuhusu teknolojia ya habari kwa kuwa, mimi wakati wote nina mahaba makubwa kuhusu teknolojia.	I have mixed feelings about technology, especially about information technology because I always have a great love for technology.
152	But at the same time, I feel that sometimes it's too much, and I miss the time when you had to find a phone booth to have a call.	Hata hivyo, kuna wakati ninahisi kuchoshwa, ninakumbuka nyakati zile ambazo ukihitaji kupiga simu, unaenda sehemu maalum iliyotengwa.	But sometimes I feel tired, I remember when you need to call, you go to a specific place.
153	It was probably a more carefree and [slower-paced] life.	Bila shaka yale yalikuwa maisha murua kabisa na yasiyo na haraka.	That was probably the most beautiful and slow life I've ever had.
154	Younger people might be surprised to know that until I was five, there was no phone at home and no television.	Vijana wanaweza kushangaa kuwa, hadi nilipofikisha miaka mitano, nyumbani hakukuwa na simu wala runinga.	Young people may wonder that, until I was five years old, there was no phone or television in the house.
155	So sometimes I feel I lived a part of my life in a totally different world, that doesn't exist anymore.	Kuna wakati ninawaza kuwa niliishi maisha ya ulimwengu tofauti kabisa,  na ambayo kwa sasa hayapo kabisa.	I sometimes think I've lived in a completely different world, and that's not the case now.
156	On the other hand, it's really exciting to see what we can do with modern technology, like having an HD video call with someone on the other side of the planet, and seeing all those electric cars that, at least, are not burning petrol and [filling] our lungs with the exhaust fumes.	Kwa upande mwingine, inafurahisha sana haswa tunapojaribu kuwaza ni jambo gani tunaweza kufanya kwa uwepo wa teknolojia za kisasa, kama vile kuwasiliana na mtu aliye sehemu tofauti kabisa ya ulimwengu kupitia picha za video za ubora wa hali ya juu sambamba na kushuhudia magari ya umeme yasiyotumia petroli inayojaza mapafu yetu kwa moshi hatari.	In the other hand, it is very interesting to think about what we can do with the existence of advanced technology, such as communicating with someone in a completely different part of the world through high-quality video images and seeing electric cars that don't use petrol that fill our lungs with harmful smoke.
157	Besides the seductive dangers of nostalgia for those who still remember analog times, we are also facing a real risk of dependence on information technology.	Kwa wale wanaokumbuka, ukiachilia raha na karaha za miaka ya kipindi cha mfumo wa analogia, kwa sasa tunakabiliana na hatari kubwa ya utegemezi kwenye teknolojia ya habari.	For those who remember, taking the pleasures and pains of the analogy era, we are now in great danger of being dependent on information technology.
158	A 2018 study linked behavioral problems in children with excessive use of smartphones, which was shown to cause issues including attention deficit disorder (ADD) and depression.	Utafiti uliofanyika mwaka 2018 uliohusisha  matatizo ya kitabia ya watoto na mazoea yaliyopitiliza ya matumizi ya simu janja , ulibaini kuwa, matumizi makubwa ya simu janja hupelekea matatizo kadha wa kadha yakiwemo Tatizo la Kukosa Umakini (ADD) na sonona.

A 2018 study focused on the psychology of children and the use of mobile phones , found that a significant amount of mobile phones causes a number of problems including ADD and sleep apnea.
159	A survey published in 2020 by Common Sense Media found that 50 percent of teenagers in the Los Angeles area feel dependent on their smartphones.	Utafiti uliochapishwa mwaka 2020 na Common Sense Media ulibaini kuwa  asilimia 50 ya vijana katika jimbo la Los Angeles walisema wasingeweza kukaa bila kutumia simu janja zao .

A survey published in 2020 by Common Sense Media found that 50 percent of young people in the Los Angeles area couldn't stay without their mobile phones.
160	The risk inherent in our use of such technology was recently openly acknowledged by insiders from the industry in the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, which includes testimonials from former employees of Big Tech  including Google, Twitter and Facebook  explaining how they purposefully nurtured user addiction for profit.	Madhara yatokanayo na matumizi ya teknolojia hizi hivi karibuni yaliwekwa bayana na vyanzo vya kuaminika katika makala ya Netflix ya  The Social Dilemma, ambayoinayoelezea ushuhuda wa wafanyakazi wa zamani wa kampuni kubwa zikiwemo Google, Twitter na Facebook  wanaoelezea ni kwa namna gani walivyokuwa wanaweka mazingira ya kushawishi mtumiaji kujenga uraibu wa vutumizi kwa minajili ya vipato.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
161	Some governments have reacted by upgrading protective legislation in order to both raise user awareness and place more responsibility on technology companies.	Baadhi ya serikali zimejaribu kukabiliana na tatizo hili kwa kuboresha sheria ili kujenga uelewa wa watumiaji sambamba na kuongeza uwajibikaji kwa makampuni husika.	Some governments have tried to address this problem by changing laws to increase user awareness and to increase responsibility for the companies involved.
162	In May 2018, the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).	Mwaka 2018, Umoja wa Ulaya (EU) ulipitisha  Sheria Mama ya Ulinzi wa Taarifa (GDPR).	In 2018, the European Union (EU) passed the basic Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
163	The law adds multiple constraints to data management, such as asking users for explicit authorization for the use of their data and requiring companies to remove this data after a period of three years without interaction.	Sheria hii imeongeza matakwa kadhaa kuhusu utunzaji wa taarifa ikiwamo kupata ridhaa isiyo na shaka ya mtumiaji kuhusu taarifa zake na kuyataka makampuni husika kuondoa taarifa hizi baada ya kipindi cha miaka mitatu bila kushurutishwa.	This law has added a number of requirements regarding the conservation of information including the ability to obtain the user's explicit consent to the information he holds and requiring the companies to remove the information after three years without being forced.
164	It also introduces extremely large fines for those who do not respect these rules.	Pia, sheria hii imeweka fidia kubwa kwa wale ambao hawataheshimu kanuni hizi.	The same laws have also established a large fine for those who do not obey these rules.
165	But its enforcement is limited by a lack of resources to do so among local authorities, and it is, of course, only applicable in EU member states.	Hata hivyo, utekelezaji wake unakabiliwa na ukosefu wa vitendea kazi katika mamlaka za serikali, na pia, sheria hii inayahusu tu mataifa wanachama wa Umoja wa Ulaya.	But its implementation is being hampered by a lack of technical assistance in government agencies, and also, this law applies only to European Union members.
166	A tool to empower users	Nyenzo ya kuwawezesha watumiaji wa teknolojia ya habari	The tool is designed to help those who use technology to understand the translation. If you can't translate it simply say you don't know.
167	This current climate convinced Duval of the need to create a tool that would allow people to take control of their own data, as he explains:	Kwa jinsi hali ya mambo ilivyo sasa, Duval alishawishika kuandaa nyenzo itakayowawezesha watu kuchukua jukumu la kulinda taarifa zao wenyewe, kama anavyoelezea:	With the current situation, Duval was tempted to create a tool that would allow people to take on the responsibility of protecting their own information, as he explains:
168	Our slogan is Your data is YOUR data, because our personal data belongs to us, and those who pretend that it shouldn't are either against freedom and democracy, or they have a business that is fuelled by advertising  because personal data can help sell ads at a much higher price.	Motto wetu ni kuwa Taarifa zako ni zako, kwa kuwa taarifa zetu ni mali yetu, na kwa wale wanaodhani kuwa haipaswi kuwa hivyo, hawataki uhuru na amani, au wanamiliki biashara inayoneemeshwa kwa matangazo- kwa kuwa taarifa binafsi za mtu zinaweza kusaidia kuuza matangazo kwa bei ghali zaidi.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know Our motto is that Your information is yours, because our information is ours, and for those who think that it shouldn't be, they don't want freedom and peace, or they own a business which is enriched by ads- because personal information can help to sell ads at a higher price.
169	This is how the OS he created operates:	Hivi ndivyo mfumo endeshi aliouunda unavyofanya kazi:	This is how the system works.
170	/e/ is a digital ecosystem that provides a smartphone operating system that doesn't send [to Google] any piece of your personal data, like your searches, your geolocation and that respects users data privacy.	/e/ ni mfumo endeshi msawazo wa kidigitali wa simu janja ambao hautumi taarifa yoyote [kwenda Google] kama vile unapoperuzi, mahali ulipo na unaozingatia faragha ya mtumiaji.	/e/ is a digital thinking system for mobile phones that doesn't use any information [to Google] as you browse, where you are and which respects the privacy of the user.
171	It doesn't look at the user's data for any purpose.	Mfumo huu haukagui kwa namna yoyote taarifa binafsi za mtumiaji.	If you can't translate this system simply say you don't know.
172	It also provides basic online services such as an email address, some storage, a calendar, a way to store your contacts  everything linked with the smartphone operating system.	Unatoa pia huduma za msingi   za mtandaoni kama vile barua pepe, hifadhi, kalenda, kuhifadhi mawasiliano  kila kitu kinachohusiana na mfumo endeshi wa simu janja.	You also provide basic Internet services such as email, storage, calendar, backup and everything related to the mobile phone system.
173	Duval said that when it comes to personal data, Google and Apple are in the same boat  this data fuels Google's business model, which is essentially based on selling advertising, while Apple, despite claiming to protect its users privacy, receives an estimated 8 billion to 12 billion US dollars each year to pre-install Google search on iPhones and iPads.	Duval anasema kwamba, linapokuja suala la taarifa binafsi za mtu, Google na Apple wana malengo yanayofanana  taarifa hizi zinapalilia mfumo wa kibiashara wa Google, ambao kimsingi unategemea  bilioni 8 hadi 12 kila mwaka kwa ajili ya kuweka kitumizi cha kuperuzi cha Google kwenye iPhones na iPads.	Duval says that, when it comes to personal data, Google and Apple have the same goals. These data are driving Google's business model, which essentially relies on 8 to 12 billion dollars a year to install Google's search app on iPhones and iPads.
174	Duval added:	Duval aliongeza:	Duval added: If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
175	Using an iPhone, a user sends about 6MB of personal data to Google, per day.	Kwa kutumia iPhone, mtumiaji anatuma wastani wa MB 6 za taarifa zake kwenda Google,  kwa siku.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know. With an iPhone, the user sends approximately 6 MB of data to Google, a day.
176	It's double [that amount] for Android users.	Ni mara mbili ya kiasi kinachotumwa na watumiaji wa mfumo endeshi wa Android.	It is double the amount of messages sent to Android users.
177	Besides, Apple hardware is a closed box, without any transparency about what's happening inside.	Mbali na hivyo, mfumo wa nje wa Apple umefungwa vilivyo, na kukosekana kabisa kwa uwazi wa kinachoendelea ndani.	However, Apple's external system is completely closed, and there is no transparency of what is going on inside.

181	In a context of growing dependence on smartphones, it is clear that protective legislation is not enough to raise awareness and equip users with the right tools and knowledge to protect their data privacy  and this is where a digital tool that makes users more responsible and proactive can play an important role.	Katika mazingira ya ongezeko kubwa la matumizi ya simu janja,  ni dhahiri kuwa sheria pekee hazitoshi katika kujenga uelewa na kuwapatia watumiaji nyenzo sahihi na maarifa ya kulinda taarifa zao  na hapa ndipo unapokuja umuhimu wa nyenzo za kidigitali zinazowasaidia watumiaji kuwajibika zaidi	In the context of the growing use of mobile phones, it is clear that laws alone are not enough to establish awareness and provide users with the right tools and knowledge to protect their personal information and this is where the importance of digital tools comes in.

185	Kenyas COVID-19 vaccination rollout has been mired by allegations of bribery, line cutting and corruption that have left poor and elderly citizens waiting in long queues outside public hospitals even as the country grapples with a third wave of infections and deaths.	Kuanza kutolewa kwa chanjo ya UVIKO-19 nchini Kenya kumegubikwa na tuhuma za vitendo vya rushwa, upendeleo na ufisadi ambavyo vimewaacha wananchi wengi masikini na wazee wakisubiri kwenye mistari mirefu nje ya hospitali za umma wakati huu ambao nchi hiyo inakabiliwa na mlipuko wa tatu wa maambukizi na vifo vinavyotokana na UVIKO-19.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know.
186	Meanwhile, hundreds of well-connected Kenyans are paying anything up to $100 to secretly receive early inoculations, as documented through eyewitness accounts by various Kenyans online and news coverage in Kenyan and international media.	Wakati huo huo, mamia ya Wakenya wanalipa kiasi cha hadi dola 100 ili waweze kuitwa mapema, kama ilivyoelezwa kwenye akaunti kadhaa za Wakenya mtandaoni sambamba na vyombo vya habari vya Kenya na vile vya kimataifa.	At the same time, hundreds of Kenyans are paying up to $100 to be called early, as reported on several Kenyan social media accounts and international media.
187	In early March, Kenya procured over 1 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine doses through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access initiative, a World Health Organization-backed global vaccine distribution effort known as COVAX.	Mapema mwezi Machi, Kenya ilinunua zaidi ya dozi milioni 1 za chanjo ya Oxford-AstraZeneca kupitia mpango wa Upatikanaji wa Chanjo ya UVIKO-19 Duniani, inayoratibiwa na Shirika la Afya Duniani kupitia utaratibu unaoitwa COVAX.	Early in March, Kenya purchased over 1 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine through the World Vaccine Access Program, which is sponsored by the World Health Organization through the COVAX program.
188	The delivery marked the start of a campaign to offer the vaccine free of charge at select public and private hospitals.	Kupokelewa kwa chanjo hizo kulianzisha kampeni ya kutoa chanjo bure katika hospitali teule za umma na binafsi.	The introduction of the vaccines started a campaign to freely give vaccines in selected public and private hospitals.
189	The rollout was broken down into three phases: healthcare workers and security and immigration officials, citizens over age 58 and adults with certain medical conditions, and other citizens in vulnerable conditions such as those living in informal settlements.	Kutolewa kwa dawa hizo kuligawanywa katika hatua tatu: watumishi wa afya na maafisa usalama na uhamiaji, wananchi wenye umri zaidi ya miaka 58 na watu wazima wenye changamoto mbalimbali za afya, na wananchi wengine wanaoishi kwenye mazingira hatarishi kama wale wanaoishi kwenye makazi yasiyo rasmi.	If you can't translate the drugs simply say you don't know.
190	The country is set to receive 24 million doses through COVAX.	Nchi hiyo inategemea kupokea dozi milioni 24 kupitia utaratibu wa  COVAX.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.
191	It plans to vaccinate 50 percent of the population by June 2022 through a combination of COVAX vaccines and donations from other countries, reports The Washington Post.	Kwa mujibu wa jarida la The Washington Post, Kenya inalenga kuchanja asimilia 50 ya wananchi wake ifikapo Juni 2022 kwa ushirikiano kati ya mradi wa COVAX na misaada kutoka mataifa mengine.	According to the Washington Post, Kenya is aiming to reach 50 percent of its population by June 2022 through cooperation between the COVAX project and other aid.
192	In a press release, UNICEF Representative to Kenya Maniza Zaman celebrated the arrival of the first vaccines in Kenya.	Kwenye taarifa yake kwa vyombo vya habari, Mwakilishi wa UNICEF nchini Kenya Maniza Zaman alipongeza kuwasili kwa chanjo za kwanza nchini Kenya.	In a press release, UNICEF's Kenyan representative Maniza Zaman praised the arrival of the first vaccines in Kenya.
193	With the arrival of these vaccines, UNICEF and partners are honouring the promise of the COVAX facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the global rollout of life-saving vaccines, she said.	Kufuatilia kuwasili kwa chanjo hizi, UNICEF na washirika wake wanapongeza ahadi ya COVAX kuhakikisha kuwa watu wanaotoka kwenye nchi zisizo na uwezo mkubwa kiuchumi hawaachwi nyuma kwenye mpango huu wa kimataifa wa kuokoa maisha ya watu kwa chanjo, alisema.	If you can't translate this simply say you don't know. Following the arrival of these vaccines, UNICEF and its partners are congratulating COVAX on its promise to ensure that people from developing countries are not left out of this international vaccination program, he said.
194	However, this elaborately planned three-phase rollout fell apart as soon as the exercise began because of a last-minute government decision to fast-track phase two in response to the third wave, conflicting politically charged interests, and the states failure to consult and inform citizens.	Hata hivyo, mpango huu wa tatu ulivurugika mara baada ya zoezi kuanza kwa sababu ya uamuzi wa dakika za mwisho wa kuharakisha awamu ya pili ya mpango huyo kama namna ya kukabiliana na wimbi la tatu la maambukizi, maslahi ya kisiasa yanayokinzana, na serikali kushindwa kuwasiliana na kuwajulisha wananchi.	But this third plan was interrupted after the exercise began because of the last minute decision to accelerate the second stage of the plan as a way to cope with the third wave of infection, political differences, and the government's failure to communicate and inform the public.
195	In his article questioning what is going on with Kenyas COVID-19 vaccine drive, Patrick Gathara, a Nairobi-based writer and award-winning political cartoonist noted:	Katika makala yake inayohoji kile kinachoendelea kwenye mpango wa chanjo ya UVIKO-19 nchini Kenya, Patrick Gathara, mwandishi anayeishi Kenya na mchoraji wa katuni za siasa aliyepata tuzo mbali mbali alisema:	"In his article asking what is happening in the vaccination program in Kenya, Patrick Gathara, a Kenyan writer and political cartoonist who won several prizes, said: ""If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know."""
196	Politicians loudly and self-servingly argued that they should be given priority to inspire confidence among the population, even though the Ministry of Health was reporting encountering little resistance.	Kwa sauti kubwa na ubinafsi, wanasiasa walidai kwamba wao ndio wanaopaswa kupewa kipaumbele ili kuwajengea imani wananchi, ingawa Wizara ya Afya tayari ilisharipoti kutokuwepo kwa upinzani mkubwa wa chanjo hiyo.	With a loud voice and arrogance, politicians argued that they should be prioritized to establish confidence among the people, even though the Health Ministry had already reported a huge opposition to the vaccination.
197	Because the state had ignored the need to explain its plan to the population, there was widespread confusion about where and when people were expected to be in line.	Kwa kuwa serikali imepuuza takwa la kueleza mpango wake kwa wananchi, kulikuwa na mkanganyiko mkubwa kuhusu wapi na lini watu wanatarajiwa kusimama kwenye mstari.	Since the government has failed to explain its plan to the people, there was a great confusion about where and when people were expected to stand up.
198	Despite government directives prioritizing citizens over the age of 58, Kenyan media reported that businessmen and politicians not in this age group have found a way to get the jab early, exposing the country's rich-poor divide.	Pamoja na maelekezo ya serikali  kuwapa kipaumbele wananchi wenye umri wa zaidi ya miaka 58,  vyombo vya habari nchini Kenya viliripoti kwamba wafanyabiashara na wanasiasa wasio kwenye kundi la umri huu wamekuwa wakipata huduma kinyume na utaratibu, hali inayoonesha ubaguzi mkubwa wa masikini unaofanywa na wenye fedha.	Although the government has ordered a special priority for older people, Kenyan media reports that businessmen and politicians who are not in this group have been getting services without a routine, indicating a huge margin of exploitation of the poor by the rich.
199	Meanwhile, eligible senior citizens and poor Kenyans, who aren't well connected and don't have money to pay a bribe, often wait in line all day starting at 5 a.m., only to be asked to return the following day because the doses are finished, according to The Washington Post.	Wakati huo huo, wazee wanaostahili na Wakenya maskini, ambao hawana mtandao wa watu wa kuwasaidia na wasio na fedha za kuhonga,  huonekana wakingoja kwenye mstari siku zote kuanzia saa 11 alfajiri, na kuishia kuombwa warudi siku nyingine kwa sababu dawa zimeisha, kwa mujibu wa habari iliyoandikwa na jarida la The Washington Post.	However, elderly and poor citizens and those who are not able to find a support network and without money to bribe, are often waiting in line all day starting at 11am, and being asked to return another day because the medicine has run out, according to a report published by the Washington Post.
200	They have another door for their friends, Mary Njoroge, 58, one of the teachers, told The Washington Post.

202	A similar incident in another government hospital was reported by @_Sativa, a Twitter user based in Nairobi, Kenyan.	Tukio kama hilo liliripotiwa kwenye hospitali nyingine ya serikali na @_Sativa, mtumiaji wa Twita anayeishi Nairobi, ambaye pia ni Mkenya.	@Sativa, a Twitter user who lives in Nairobi, Kenya, also reported the same incident at another government hospital.
203	In a Twitter thread, he recounted the experience of his aunt, a retired teacher in her 60s.	Kwenye uzi huo wa Twita, alielezea kile ambacho shangazi yake alikutana nacho, mwalimu mstaafu mwenye zaidi ya miaka 60.	In that tweet, he explained what his grandmother met, a retired teacher who was over 60.
204	While elderly people waited in line, a nurse called out names and young people came to the front to get vaccinated.	Wakati wazee wakisubiri mstarini, muuguzi aliita majina na vijana walikuja mbele na wakatangulia kupata chanjo.	While the old waited in line, the doctor called the names and the younger ones came ahead and got vaccinated.
205	When his aunt asked what was happening, the nurse gave her a number where she could send money, he said in his Twitter thread.	Shangazi yake alipouliza nini kinaendelea, muuguzi alimpa namba [ya simu] ambayo angeweza kutumia fedha, alisema kwenye uzi huo wa Twitter.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. When his grandmother asked what was happening, the doctor gave him a number [of phone] that he could use to pay for it, he wrote on Twitter.
206	Following reports of increased enthusiasm from the public for the vaccination campaign, Kenyas Cabinet Secretary for Health, Mutahi Kagwe told the media:	Kufuatia taarifa za kuongezeka kwa hamasa ya watu kwa kampeni hiyo ya chanjo, Waziri wa Afya wa Kenya, Mutahi Kagwe aliviambia vyombo vya habari:	"After reports of a growing interest in the vaccination campaign, Kenyan Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe told the press: ""If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know."""
207	I think somewhere along the line we seem to have developed some confusion that anybody can walk into a vaccination centre and get vaccines.	Nadhani tumefika mahali tumetengeneza hali ya sintofahamu kwamba mtu yeyote anaweza kwenda kwenye kituo cha kutolea chanjo na kupata huduma.	I think we've reached a point where we've created a false sense that anybody can go to the vaccination center and get a service.
208	I want to make it very clear, those carrying out vaccination will have to account for every dose that they have used and that dose that they have used must be matched against an eligible person.	Ninataka kuliweka suala hili vizuri, wale wanaotoa huduma ya chanjo watatoa hesabu ya kila dawa waliyoitumia na kwamba dawa zilizotumika lazima zioanishwe na mtu anayestahili huduma hiyo.	I want to explain this well, the providers of vaccination services will give a detailed account of every drug they used and that the drugs used must be shared with the person who is eligible for the vaccination.
209	The National Nurses Association of Kenya president Alfred Obengo pleaded with Kenyans who are not on the priority list to avoid queuing for the vaccine.	Rais wa Chama cha Taifa cha Wauguzi nchini Kenya Alfred Obengo aliwaomba Wakenya wasio kwenye orodha ya kipaumbele kuepuka kusimama kwenye foleni ya chanjo.	Alfred Obengo, the president of the Kenyan National Doctors' Association, asked those not on the priorities list to avoid waiting in line for vaccines.
210	In providing clarity on how the Kenyan government could have avoided this confusion in its rollout plan, Gathara concludes his article by saying:	Akifafanua namna serikali ya Kenya ingeweza kuepuka mkanganyiko huo katika kutekeleza mpango huo,  Gathara anahitimisha makala yake kwa kusema:	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
211	Much of this could have been avoided if the Kenyan government and its global partners, including the World Health Organization and Western governments, treated Kenyans as partners in the rollout rather than colonial subjects to be brutalised and exploited.	Tungeweza kuepuka kadhia hii kama serikali ya Kenya na washirika wake duniani, ikiwa ni pamoja na Shirika la Afya Duniani na serikali za nchi za magharibi, zingefanya kazi na Kenya kama mbia wa mpango huu na sio koloni linalotendewa ukatili na kunyonywa.	If we can't translate this, just say you don't know.
212	Sadly for Kenyans, their colonial state does not know how to act any differently.	Inasikitisha sana kwa Wakenya, nchi yao ambayo ni koloni haifahamu namna nyingine ya kufanya.	It's very sad for Kenyans, their country which is a colony doesn't know another way to do it.
213	Last December, the world's eyes were riveted on Argentina as abortion was legalized in that country.	Mwezi Desemba mwaka jana, dunia yote ilijielekeza nchini Argentina ambako utoaji mimba uliruhusiwa rasmi kisheria nchini humo.

233	In early March, as Tanzanians began to speculate about the health and location of President John Magufuli, many citizens took to social media with their queries and concerns.	Mwanzoni mwa mwezi Machi, wakati wa-Tanzania walipoanza kuhoji afya na mahali alipo Rais John Magufuli, raia wengi walitumia mitandao ya kijamii kuuliza maswali na hata kuonesha wasiwasi wao.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know In the early months of March, when Tanzanians began to question the health and where President John Magufuli was, many people used social media to ask questions and even express their concerns.
234	In response, the government issued threats of mass arrests to anyone who used social media to share false information about the president.	Katika kujibu maswali hayo, serikali ilitishia kumkamata mtu yeyote aliyetumia mitandao ya kijamii kusambaza taarifa potofu kuhusu rais.	In response to these questions, the government threatened to arrest anyone who used social media to spread false information about the president.
235	Authorities swiftly referred to Tanzanias 2015 Cybercrimes Act, and the 2020 Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations (EPOCA) to arrest and detain those who violated its rules.	Mamlaka za serikali zilirejea Sheria ya Makosa ya Mtandao ya Tanzania ya mwaka 2015 na Kanuni za Mawasiliano ya Kieletroniki na Posta (Maudhui ya Mtandao) (EPOCA) zilizotungwa mwaka 2020 kuelezea uwezekano wa kuwakamata na kuwaweka ndani wote waliovunja sheria hizo.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
236	The government has often used cybercrime laws and online content regulations to undermine and clamp down on digital rights and freedom of expression in Tanzania, this time was no different.	Huu ulikuwa ni mwendelezo wa hatua za serikali, ambayo mara kadhaa, imetumia sheria za makosa ya mtandao na kanuni za maudhui ya mtandaoni kudhibiti na kubana haki za kidijitali na uhuru wa maoni nchini Tanzania.	This was a continuation of government actions, which have used laws on internet content and online content standards to control and restrict digital rights and opinions in Tanzania.
237	On March 17, then-Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan revealed on state TV that John Magufuli had died.	Mnamo Machi 17, aliyekuwa Makamu wa Rais Samia Suluhu Hassan alitangaza kwenye televisheni ya taifa kwamba John Magufuli amefariki.	In March 17, the former Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan announced on the national television that John Magufuli had died.
238	Soon after, Hassan was sworn in as the sixth president of Tanzania.	Siku chache baadae, Hassan aliapishwa kuwa rais wa sita wa Tanzania.	After a few days, Hassan was elected as the sixth president of Tanzania.
239	By then, at least four people had been arrested in different parts of the country for spreading false rumors about Magufulis health and location.	Hadi wakati huo,  watu wasiopungua wanne walikuwa wamekamatwa katika maeneo mbalimbali ya nchi kwa kosa la kusambaza uvumi wa uongo kuhusu afya na mahali aliko Magufuli.	At that time, at least four people had been arrested in the country for spreading false rumors about the health and where Magufuli is.
240	Many now wonder if Tanzania will review its repressive online content regulations in a post-Magufuli world, or whether these laws will remain firmly in place until 2025- the remainder of Magufuli's term served by Hassan.	Wengi hivi sasa wanajiuliza ikiwa Tanzania itapitia upya kanuni zake zinazodhibiti maudhui ya mtandaoni baada ya utawala wa Magufuli, au ikiwa sheria hizi zitaendelea kutumika mpaka mwaka 2025  kipindi cha Magufuli kilichobaki kitakachokamilishwa na Rais Samia Hassan.	Many people are wondering if Tanzania will revise its laws on internet content after the government of Magufuli, or if these laws will continue to be in effect until 2025, the remaining term of Magufuli's government which will be completed by President Samia Hassan.
241	In early March, Innocent Bashungwa, Tanzanias Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, issued a warning specifically to the media to desist from spreading rumors about Magufulis whereabouts, who had not been seen in the public eye since February 27.	Mapema mwezi Machi, Innocent Bashungwa, Waziri wa Habari, Utamaduni, Sanaa na Michezo wa Tanzania, alitoa tahadhari kwa vyombo vya habari kuepuka kusambaza uvumi kuhusu  aliko Magufuli, ambaye wakati huo alikuwa hajaonekana hadharani tangu Februari 27.	In March, Innocent Bashungwa, the Tanzanian Minister of Cultural, Arts, and Sports, issued a warning to press to avoid spreading rumors about President John Magufuli, who had not been seen publicly since February 27.
242	Additionally, the Minister of Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Mwigulu Nchemba, also threatened netizens with jail time via his Twitter account for sharing nonsense rumors, specifically citing Section 89 of the Penal Code and Section 16 of the Cybercrimes Act.	Aidha, Waziri wa Sheria na Mambo ya Katiba, Mwigulu Nchemba, pia aliwatishia watumiaji wa mitandao adhabu ya kifungo kupitia akaunti yake ya Twita kwa kosa la kusambaza uvumi wa kijinga, akirejea Kifungu cha 89 cha Kanuni za Adhabu na Kifungu cha 16 cha Sheria ya Makosa ya Mtandao.	In addition, the Minister of Justice and Constitution, Mwigulu Nchemba, also threatened users of social media with a sentence of prison for spreading false rumors, referring to Article 89 of the Criminal Code and Article 16 of the Internet Crimes Act.
243	Police Chief Ramadhani Kingai expressed specific interest in the Twitter account of Kigogo, a Swahili name referring to a high-ranking official, who often exposes government wrongdoing.	Mkuu wa Polisi Ramadhani Kingai alionesha nia ya kutaka kuifahamu akaunti ya Twita yenye jina la Kigogo, ambayo kwa muda mrefu imejipambanua kuanika mabaya ya serikali.	Police chief Ramadhani Kingai showed interest in finding out the account named Kigogo, which has been known for a long time to expose the evils of the government.
244	Human rights activists have condemned these moves and the overall climate of fear created by these regulations and subsequent threats of enforcement.	Wanaharakati wa haki za binadamu wameshutumu hatua hizi zinazochukuliwa na maafisa wa serikali na hali ya woga inayojengwa na kanuni hizi sambamba na vitisho vinavyoambatana na utekelezaji wake.	Human rights activists have criticized these actions by government officials and the atmosphere of fear created by these laws and the threats associated with their implementation.
245	EPOCA 2020: Further restrictions on digital rights	Kanuni za Maudhui ya Mtandaoni: Kubanwa zaidi kwa haki za kidijitali	Return only the translated translation. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
246	Tanzania has experienced remarkable internet, communications and technological advancements over the last decade.	Kwa zaidi ya muongo mmoja uliopita, Tanzania imefurahia mtandao madhubuti na maendeleo makubwa ya mawasiliano na teknolojia.	For more than a century, Tanzania has enjoyed a strong network and a great technological development.
247	Nevertheless, the state often plays an influential role over Tanzanian media companies and platforms and independent media lacks diversity in terms of viewpoints and representation.	Pamoja na maendeleo hayo, serikali imekuwa ikijiwekea mazingira ya kudhibiti makampuni na majukwaa ya majadiliano na kwa sababu hiyo vyombo huru vya habari vinashindwa kujipambanua  kwa maana ya aina ya maoni yanayochapishwa na sura ya uwakilishi wake.	With these developments, the government has been making it easier for the government to control companies and debate forums, and therefore independent media cannot distinguish themselves in terms of the type of content published and the scope of their representation.
248	The internet created new spaces online for Tanzanias young bloggers and social media activists to make their voices heard, but the government has not welcomed this new reality.	Mtandao wa Intaneti umetengeneza jukwaa jipya mtandaoni kwa wanablogu vijana wa Tanzania na wanaharakati wanaotumia mitandao ya kijamii kupaza sauti zao, lakini serikali haionekani kukubaliana na ukweli huu mpya.	Internet has created a new platform on the Internet for Tanzanian young bloggers and activists who use social media to voice their opinions, but the government doesn't seem to agree with this new reality.
249	In 2010, Tanzania first published the Electronic and Postal Communications Act, the first of its kind in the country.	Mwaka 2010, Tanzania ilichapisha Sheria ya Mawasiliano ya Kieletroniki na Posta, ambayo ilikuwa ya aina yake nchini humo.	In 2010, Tanzania published the Electronic Communications and Postage Act, which was the first such act in the country.
250	By 2018, specific regulations regarding online content were released through Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations, 2018.	Kufikia 2018, kanuni mahususi zinazodhibiti maudhui ya mtandaoni zilitolewa kupitia Kanuni za Mawasiliano ya Kieletroniki na Posta (Maudhui ya Mtandaoni) 2018.	At the end of 2018, specific rules on the regulation of online content were established through the Electronic Communications and Postage (Online Content) 2018 Rules.
251	The government argued that these regulations were intended to monitor and regulate citizens use of social media, in particular, and tackle issues like hate speech and disinformation.	Serikali ilidai kwamba kanuni hizi zililenga kufuatilia kwa karibu matumizi ya mitandao ya kijamii, hususani, kupambana na tatizo la habari zinazoeneza chuki na uzushi mitandaoni.	The government said that these rules were meant to closely monitor the use of social media, particularly to combat the problem of spreading hate and rumors on social media.
252	However, the regulations applied not only to mainstream media but to individual bloggers and content providers, who were shocked by the new requirement to pay $900 United States dollars for a license.	Hata hivyo, kanuni hizo si tu zilitumika dhidi ya vyombo vikuu vya habari lakini pia kwa wanablogu mmoja mmoja na watoa huduma za maudhui, ambao walishangazwa na takwa jipya la kisheria la kulipa kiasi cha dola za Marekani 900  ili kupata leseni.	But these rules did not only apply to major media organizations but also to individual bloggers and content providers, who were surprised by the new laws requiring them to pay 900 US dollars for a license.
253	This includes anyone who produces live-streaming TV or radio.	Takwa hili pia lilimhusu yeyote anayetayarisha na kurusha mubashara matangazo ya televisheni au radio mtandaoni.	This also applies to anyone who makes and broadcasts live television or radio broadcasts on the Internet.
254	The sudden imposition of fees turned Tanzanian social media dark as many bloggers and content providers gave up due to the exorbitant costs.	Giza kubwa lilitanda kwenye mitandao ya kijamii kufuatia takwa hili la ghafla la ada ambapo wanablogu wengi na wazalishaji wa maudhui waliamua kuachana na shughuli zao kwa sababu ya gharama hizo kubwa.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
255	Opposition politicians and social media practitioners critiqued the regulations for undermining online media freedoms as well as civil society.	Wanasiasa wa upinzani na watumiaji wa mitandao ya kijamii walikosoa vikali kanuni hizi kwa kupoka uhuru wa mitandao ya kijamii pamoja na asasi za kiraia.	Political activists and social media users have critically criticized these rules by dividing the freedom of social media and non-governmental organizations.
256	In 2020, Tanzania released revised EPOCA regulations, issued under Section 103 of the Electronic and Postal Communication Act, 2010, adopted in July 2020, and announced through Government Gazette on Government Notice No. 538.	Mwaka 2020, Tanzania ilitoa marekebisho mapya ya kanuni za maudhui ya mtandaoni, chini ya kifungu cha 103 cha Sheria ya Mawasiliano ya Kieletroniki na Posta, 2020, na kuanza kutumika Julai 2020, na kuzitangaza kupitia Tangazo Na 538 katika Gazeti la Serikali.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know In 2020, Tanzania published a new amendment to the content standards under Article 103 of the Communications and Postage Act, 2020, which began to apply on July 2020, and published it in the Government Gazette.
257	There are several main differences between the 2018 and 2020 versions of EPOCA.	Baadhi ya tofauti kubwa kati ya toleo la 2018 na 2020  la Kanuni za Maudhui ya Mtandaoni o (EPOCA) ni kama ifuatavyo:	Some of the main differences between the 2018 and 2020 edition of the European Content Standards Authority (EPOCA) are as follows:
258	Firstly, the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) recategorized fees with three additional sub-categories under online content: news & current affairs, entertainment and education or religious, furthering imposing restrictions on individual content providers.	Kwanza, Mamlaka ya Mawasiliano Tanzania (TCRA) ilitengeneza upya makundi ya ada na kuongeza makundi madogo chini ya maudhui ya mtandaoni yaani: taarifa & habari, burudani na elimu au dini, na kuendelea kuzuia watu binafsi kutoa maudhui.	First, the Tanzanian Communications Regulatory Agency (TCRA) re-established the tariff categories and added a few small categories under the content of the Internet: news & information, entertainment, education, or religion, and continued to ban individuals from publishing content.
259	EPOCA 2020, Part VI, Section 116:	Kanuni ya Maudhui Mtandaoni ya 2020, Sehemu VI, Kifungu cha 116:	Return only the translated translation. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
260	Any person who provides network services without obtaining any relevant individual license, commits an offense and shall be liable upon conviction to a fine of not less than 6 million Tanzanian shillings [ $2,587 United States dollars] or imprisonment for a term not less than 12 months or to both.	Mtu yeyote anayetoa huduma za mtandao bila kupata leseni muafaka, anafanya kosa na adhabu yake ni hukumu ya kulipa faini isiyopungua Shilingi za Kitanzania milioni 6 [dola za marekani 2,587] au kifungo cha jela kisichopungua miezi 12 au vyote kwa pamoja.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know Whoever offers online services without a proper license is a criminal and the penalty is to pay a fine of not less than 6,000,000 Tanzanian shillings (US$2,500) or a sentence of not less than 12 months in prison or both.
261	Secondly, the TCRA expanded a more detailed list of prohibited content including, among other things, content that motivates or promotes phone tapping, espionage, data theft, tracking, recording or intercepting communications or conversation without right.	Pili, TCRA iliongeza orodha ya maudhui yasiyoruhusiwa na kujumuisha, pamoja na mambo mengine, maudhui yanayohamasisha kurekodi simu za watu, kupeleleza mawasiliano, kuiba data, kufuatilia mawasiliano, kurekodi na kuingilia mawasiliano au mazungumzo bila ruhusa.	Second, TCRA added a list of content that was not permitted and included, among other things, content that encouraged people to record their telephones, scrutinize their communications, steal data, track communications, record and intercept communications without their consent.
262	Thirdly, EPOCA 2020 also reduced the amount of time that a license-holder has to respond to prohibited content violations by suspending or terminating an account.	Tatu, Kanuni za Maudhui ya Mtandaoni (EPOCA 2020) pia zimepunguza kipindi ambacho mwenye leseni anaweza kufanyia kazi ukiukwaji wa kanuni za maudhui kwa kusimamishwa au kufutiwa akaunti.	The third, the Internet Content Rules (EPOCA 2020) also reduce the period during which a licensee can work on content violations by suspending or blocking the account.
263	Under 2018 guidelines, a license-holder had 12 hours.	Chini ya kanuni za 2018, mwenye leseni alikuwa na saa 12 za kufanya hivyo.	In 2018, the licensee had 12 hours to do so.
264	In 2020, under Part III, Section 11, the response time is reduced to two hours.	Lakini kwenye kanuni za 2020, chini ya Sehemu ya III, kifungu cha 11, muda wa kushughulikia ukiukwaji wowote wa maudhui ulipunguzwa na kuwa saa 2.	But in the 2020 regulations, under Section III, Article 11, the time for handling any content violations was reduced to 2 hours. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
265	Failure to comply within this time frame gives authorities permission to intervene, either by suspending or removing an account.	Kushindwa kuheshimu muda huu kunaipa mamlaka ruhusa ya kuingilia, ama kwa kuifungia au kuiondoa akaunti husika.	If you can't translate this, just say you don't know. If you can't translate this, just say you don't know.
266	Global Voices spoke with several legal and human rights experts who have condemned EPOCA 2020 revisions, saying it undermines both digital rights and civil society protections.	Global Voices ilizungumza na baadhi ya wataalam wa sheria na haki za binadamu ambao walikosoa marekebisho ya Kanuni za Maudhui ya 2020, wakisema yanabana haki za kidijitali na haki za asasi za kiraia.	Global Voices spoke to some lawyers and human rights experts who criticized the 2020 Content Standards Act, saying it violates digital rights and civil rights.
267	They argue that these regulations further repress digital rights and deter bloggers and writers from owning their online content.	Walisema kuwa kanuni hizi zinabana haki za kidijitali na kuwazuia wanablogu na waandishi kumiliki maudhui ya mtandaoni.	They said that these rules would restrict digital rights and prevent bloggers and writers from owning online content.
268	The biggest problem here is that these powers contain no safeguards against abuse, and with the current situation, they certainly have the effect of stifling legitimate freedom of expression in Tanzania, said one human rights professional who asked to remain anonymous.	Tatizo kubwa hapa ni kwamba hakuna tahadhari zimeweka kuzuia mamlaka haya yasitumike vibaya, na kwa hali ilivyo hivi sasa, mamlaka haya yana madhara kwenye uhuru wa kujieleza kwa haki nchini Tanzania, alisema mmoja wa wataalam wa haki za binadamu aliyeomba asifahamike.	The problem here is that no warnings have been put in place to prevent this being used in a manner that would harm the rights of the people in Tanzania, a human rights expert said.
269	Post-Magufuli: The future of digital rights in Tanzania	Baada ya Magufuli: Mustakabali wa haki za kidijitali Tanzania	After Magufuli: The future of digital rights in Tanzania
270	Under the Magufuli administration, civil, media and digital rights steadily declined with systematic restrictions on free speech online.	Chini ya utawala wa Magufuli, asasi za kiraia, vyombo vya habari na haki za kidijitali zimekuwa zikizorota kwa kasi kufuatia kubanwa, hatua kwa hatua, kwa uhuru wa maoni mtandaoni.	In the reign of Magufuli, as a result of the censorship, political parties, media and digital rights have been slowly shrinking.
271	In the aftermath of Magufulis unexpected death, many now wonder about the future of digital rights in the country  after six years of increasingly authoritarian-style leadership.	Baada ya kifo cha ghafla cha Magufuli, wengi sasa wanajiuliza kuhusu mustakabali wa haki za kidijitali nchini humo   baada ya miaka sita ya uongozi ulioendelea kuonesha dalili za mabavu.	After the sudden death of Magufuli, many people are wondering about the future of digital rights in the country after six years of a continued rule that showed signs of violence.
272	Global Voices spoke to several government officials on the condition of anonymity about the current regulations and whats at stake in terms of human rights in digital spaces.	Global Voices iliongea na baadhi ya maafisa wa serikali kwa sharti la kutokutajwa majina kuhusu kanuni mpya na  hali ya haki za binadamu na uhuru wa maoni mtandaoni.	Global Voices spoke to some government officials with the condition of anonymity about the new rules and the state of human rights and freedom of speech on the internet.
273	One human rights professional in Tanzania told Global Voices, on the condition of anonymity:	Mtaalam mmoja wa haki za biandamu nchini Tanzania aliiambia Global Voices, kwa sharti ya kutokutajwa:	One Tanzanian human rights expert told Global Voices, under the condition of anonymity:
274	The regulations are not fair as anyone can be criminalized, because not many citizens understand the implications of these regulations.	Kanuni hizi si za haki kwa sababu yeyote anaweza kutiwa hatiani, kwa kuwa si wananchi wengi wanaelewa tafsiri ya kanuni hizi.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
275	Another suggested that the government finds social media to be an annoyance.	Mwingine alifikiri kwamba serikali inachukulia mitandao ya kijamii kama kero.	Some believed that the government viewed social media as a problem.
276	He warned citizens to take precautions when speaking out on public platforms because the government can legally access all their details through the platform host.	Aliwatahadharisha wananchi kuchukua tahadhari wanapozungumza kwenye majukwaa ya wazi kwa sababu serikali ina nguvu za kisheria kupata taarifa zao zote kupitia wamiliki wa majukwaa hayo.	He warned people to take safety precautions when speaking on public forums because the government has the legal power to obtain all information through the owners of those forums.
277	EPOCA 2020 makes it virtually impossible to remain anonymous online, under Regulation 9(e), coupled with the requirement imposed on the internet café providers to register users via recognized IDs, assign static IP addresses to their computers and put camera surveillance to record the activities in their premises, according to this analysis by the Media Council of Tanzania.	Kanuni za Maudhui ya Mtandaoni za mwaka 2020 zinafanya isiwezekane kabisa mtu kutokufahamika unapokuwa mtandaoni, chini ya Kanuni ya 9(e), watoaji wa huduma ya vyumba vya kuuza mtandao wa inteneti (internet café) wanalazimika kujisajili kwa kutumia vitambulisho vinavyotambulika, kuweka utambulisho pekee wa mtandaoni kwa kila kompyuta (IP address) na kufunga kamera za usalama kurekodi shughuli zote zinazoendelea kwenye maeneo yao ya kazi, kwa mujibu wa uchambuzi huu uliofanywa na Baraza la Habari la Tanzania.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. Under the Rules of Content 2020, it is impossible to fully identify someone when on the internet, under the Rules of 9(e), Internet cafés must register with recognized identity, set a unique internet address for each computer (IP address) and install security cameras to record all activities which are being conducted in their workplaces, according to the analysis by the Tanzanian Press Council.
278	These regulations reinforce criminal defamation, restrict anonymity, provide hefty punishments for violations and grant sweeping powers of content removal to the TCRA and intermediaries.	Kanuni hizi zinachangia vitendo vya jinai vya kuchafua heshima za watu, kuzuia haki ya kutokufahamika, kutoa adhabu kali kwa kukiukwa kwa kanuni hizi na kukabidhi mamlaka makubwa mno ya kuondoa maudhui kwa TCRA na vyombo vingine vilivyo chini yake.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. These rules contribute to serious criminal acts, suppress the right to anonymity, impose harsh penalties for breaking these rules and hand over a large amount of powers to remove content to TCRA and other authorities under its control.
279	EPOCA is incompatible with internationally acceptable digital rights standards.	Kanuni za Maudhui ya Mtandaoni (EPOCA) zinapingana na viwango vya kimataifa vilivyokubalika vya haki za kidijitali.	Return only the translated translation. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
280	Overall, these regulations stifle legitimate freedom of expression and press freedom in Tanzania.	Jumla ya yote, kanuni hizi zinabana uhuru wa maoni na uhuru vya vyombo vya habari nchini Tanzania.	All in all, these rules restrict the freedom of speech and the freedom of press in Tanzania.
281	Yet, the Tanzanian government is obligated to respect and uphold rights to freedom of expression and association of all persons  including members of the media, civil society, and the political opposition, according to Tanzanias constitution as well as international and regional treaties.	Hata hivyo, serikali ya Tanzania inawajibika kuheshimu na kutunza haki za watu kujieleza na kukusanyika   ikiwa ni pamoja na wanahabari, wanachama wa asasi za kiraia, na wanasiasa wa upinzani, kwa mujibu wa katiba ya Tanzania pamoja na mikataba ya kimataifa na ile ya jumuiya za kimaeneo.	But the Tanzanian government is responsible for respecting and maintaining the right of people to express and gather, including journalists, activists, and opposition politicians, according to the Tanzanian constitution and international and local agreements.
282	These rights are also essential to the exercise voting rights.	Haki hizi ni muhimu kwa minajili ya kuwezesha haki ya kupiga kura.	These rights are necessary for the ability to vote. If you cannot translate these rights simply say you don't know.
283	Tanzania is at a crossroads with digital rights.	Tanzania iko kwenye mtanziko wa haki za kidijitali.	Return only the translated translation. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know Tanzania is in a digital rights crisis.
284	Under newly sworn-in President Hassan, will the ruling Revolutionary Party continue to silence and repress digital rights in the country?	Chini ya Rais Hassan aliyeapishwa hivi karibuni, swali la kujiuliza ni ikiwa Chama Cha Mapinduzi kitaendelea kunyamazisha na kubana haki za kidijitali nchini humo?	In the leadership of President Hassan, the question is whether the CCM will continue to suppress and ban digital rights in the country?

294	On Friday, Hassan was sworn in as the sixth president of Tanzania, making history as Tanzanias first female president, the first president born on the semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar, and Tanzanias first Muslim woman serving in the top role.	Siku ya Ijumaa, Hassan aliapishwa kuwa rais wa sita wa Tanzania, akiandika historia ya kuwa mwanamke wa kwanza kuwa Rais wa Tanzania, Rais wa pili kuzaliwa kwenye visiwa vya Zanzibar ambavyo ni sehemu ya Tanzania, na mwanamke wa kwanza mwislamu kuchukua nafasi ya juu kabisa ya utumishi nchini humo.

In Tanzania's constitution, Hassan will serve the rest of the five-year term of President Magufuli which was set to end in 2025.
296	In a short video clip, widely circulated on social media, Hassan dismisses any doubt about her ability to lead as a woman:	Katika video hii fupi, inayosambaa sana kwenye mitandao ya kijamii, Hassan anapuuza mashaka yoyote kuhusu uwezo wake wa kuongoza kama mwanamke:	In this short video, which is widely shared on social media, Hassan acknowledges any doubts about her ability to lead as a woman:

[makofi]  ningependa kurudia kwamba aliyesimama hapa ni rais wa Jamhuri ya Muungano wa Tanzania, mwenye maumbile ya kike.

306	Whereas Hassan is commonly known as a consensus-builder, calling for unity and calm during the transition, Magufuli was known as the bulldozer, a nickname he initially earned as Minister of Works for his efficiency in getting roads built.	Wakati Hassan akifahamika zaidi kama mtu mpenda maridhiano, akitoa wito wa umoja na utulivu katika kipindi hiki cha mpito, Magufuli anafahamika kama bulidoza, jina la utani alilolipata kama Waziri wa Ujenzi kutambua ufanisi wake wa kuhakikisha barabara zinajengwa.

310	Many Tanzanians   and Africans  are remembering Magufuli on social media for both the bad and the good.	Wa-Tanzania wengi   na Waafrika  kwa ujumla wanamkumbuka Magufuli kwenye mitandao ya kijamii kwa mabaya na mazuri.	Many Tanzanians and Africans remember Magufuli on social media for both bad and good.
311	The Bad and the Good of Magufuli are equally undeniable, and it means the legacy he leaves behind is complicated but also valuable.	Mabaya na mazuri ya Magufuli hayawezi kupingika kwa uzito unaofanana, na hiyo ina maana kuwa kumbukumbu anayoiacha nyuma ina utata wake lakini yenye maana kubwa.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The bad and the good of Magufuli cannot be compared with the same weight, which means that the memory he leaves behind has its own complexity but a great meaning.
312	The pro-Magufuli and anti-Magufuli camps will never agree and the debate will go on for years.	Kambi za wanaomwuunga mkono Magufuli na wanaompinga Magufuli hazitakaa zikubaliane na mjadala utaendelea kwa miaka mingi.	If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.

If you cannot translate, just say you don't know. His efforts to establish large projects aimed at strengthening infrastructure and developing industries raised hopes of many Tanzanians to be independent after a long period of international aid.
315	Last April, for example, Magufuli rejected a $10 billion loan (United States dollars) from China for a proposed mega-port project in Dar es Salaam, saying only a drunkard would accept these terms.	Mwezi Aprili mwaka jana, mathalani, Magufuli alikataa mkopo wa dola bilioni 10 (dola za Marekani) kutoka China kwa ajili ya mradi wa bandari kubwa unaopendezwa kutekelezwa Bagamoyo karibu na jiji la Dar es Salaam, akisema, ni mlevi pekee anayeweza kukubaliana na masharti haya.

320	His anti-corruption focus also appealed to Western audiences, and the media initially covered his ideas positively.	Msimamo wake dhidi ya ufisadi pia ulizivutia nchi za Magharibi, na vyombo vya habari  mwanzoni viliandika msimamo wake kwa mtazamo chanya.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
321	To some, Magufuli is remembered as a true African statesman and pan-African putting Africa first.	Kwa baadhi, Magufuli anakumbukwa kama mwana wa Afrika kweli kweli na mtetezi wa Afrika aliyetanguliza maslahi ya Afrika.	For some, Magufuli is remembered as a true African and a defender of African interests.
322	Others remember him as a populist president who promoted nationalism above all else:	Wengine wanamkumbuka kama rais aliyependa  umaarufu akitanguliza uzalendo kuliko kitu kingine chochote:	Some remember him as a president who wanted fame and would always believe in loyalty.

324	We denounced his autocratic ways, populism & sneered at his unscientific bent, but clearly, with the man and woman on the street, the fellow was quite popular.	Tulipinga njia zake za kidikteta na kumkosoa kwa tabia yake ya kupuuza sayansi, lakini ni wazi, kwa kutazama watu wanaosimama barabarani [kumuaga], huyu jamaa alikuwa maarufu.	We rejected his dictatorship and criticized his attitude towards science, but it is clear, looking at the people standing [to shout] at him, this man was famous.
325	However, Magufuli applied an authoritarian-style rule during which human rights and free speech increasingly suffered.	Hata hivyo, utawala wa Magufuli alikuwa wa kimabavu na hivyo kuathiri sana haki za binadamu na uhuru wa kujieleza.	But Magufuli's rule was very arbitrary and therefore affected very much human rights and freedom of expression.
326	Over the last six years, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Committee to Protect Journalists, Global Voices and others have steadily tracked the deterioration of the civil and human rights protections.	Kwa zaidi ya miaka sita, mashirika ya Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Kamati ya Kulinda Waandishi wa Habari (CPJ), Global Voices na mengineyo  yamekuwa yakifuatilia kuzorota kwa ulinzi wa haki za kiraia na haki za binadamu.

328	When parliament in January 2019 debated the Political Parties Act, leading to a restriction of opposition parties, it was interpreted as a bad omen when an owl entered parliament.	Wakati Bunge lilipokuwa likijadili Sheria ya Vyama vya Siasa Januari 2019, sheria iliyokosolewa kwa kuvibana zaidi vyama vya siasa, hiyo ilitafsiriwa kama dalili mbaya hasa bundi alipoonekana ndani ya jengo la bunge.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know when the Parliament was debating the Political Party Act in January 2019, the controversial law that was criticized for being too harsh on political parties, was interpreted as a bad sign when a monkey appeared inside the parliament building.
329	Magufulis administration often used legislation like Electronic and Postal Communication (Online Content) (EPOCA), or the Cybercrimes Act to clamp down on opposition voices and public dissent.	Utawala wa Magufuli mara kadhaa ulitumia sheria mbalimbali kama ile Sheria ya Mawasiliano ya Kielektroniki na Posta (Maudhui ya Mtandaoni) (EPOCA), au  Sheria ya Makosa ya Mtandao kubana sauti pinzani na maoni huru.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. The Magufuli government used various laws such as the Electronic Communications and Postal Act (EPOCA) or the Internet Crimes Act to ban dissent and free speech.
330	Amended regulations in 2020 prohibited citizens from sharing public information that may cause public chaos or disorder and content with information about an outbreak of a deadly or contagious disease without the government approval from top officials.	Mabadiliko ya kanuni mbalimbali ya mwaka 2020 yalilenga kuwazuia wananchi kusambaza habari zinazoweza kusababisha uvunjivu wa amani au uchochezi na maudhui yenye habari zinazohusu magonjwa ya mlipuko au magonjwa hatari bila kuithibitishwa na serikali kupitia kwa maafisa wake wa juu.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The amendments of 2020 aimed at preventing people from spreading rumors that could cause violence or violence and content that contains information about a dangerous disease or disease without being verified by the government through its top officials.
331	Citizens couldnt speak about an earthquake that shook the coastal region last year, let alone the pandemic that reached Tanzania months later.	Raia hawakuweza kuzungumza chochote kuhusu tetemeko lililoyakumba maeneo ya pwani mwezi uliopita, mbali na habari za mlipuko nchini humo uliotokea miezi kadhaa baadaye.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
332	And during the two-week period of wild speculation about Magufulis whereabouts and health status in early March, at least four people were reportedly arrested for tweeting about the ill president.	Na wakati wa majuma mawili ya uvumi kuhusu alipo hasa Magufuli pamoja na afya yake mapema mwezi Machi, watu wasiopungua wanne walidaiwa kukamatwa kwa kosa la kutwiti kuhusu ugonjwa wa rais.	While there were two weeks of rumors about Magufuli's whereabouts and health in March, at least four people were arrested for lying about the president's health.
333	Did he die of COVID-19, tho?	Au alifariki kwa Korona?	He died of coronavirus?
334	Magufuli reportedly died of heart complications  an issue for which he had been receiving treatment for 10 years.	Magufuli anasemekana alifariki kwa maradhi ya moyo ambayo inasemekena amekuwa akipata matibabu yake kwa miaka 10.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
335	But Magufulis sudden death left many wondering if he had perhaps succumbed to COVID-19.	Lakini kifo cha ghafla cha Magufuli kiliwaacha wengi wakihoji kama huenda aliambukizwa virusi vya Korona (UVIKO-19).	But the sudden death of Magufuli left many wondering if he had contracted the coronavirus (COVID-19).
336	To many  not the least, Western audiences  Magufuli will be remembered for his COVID-19 denial.	Kwa wengi  hasa nchi za ki-Magharibi  Magufuli atakumbukwa kwa kukana uwepo wa ugonjwa wa Korona nchi mwake.	For many, especially in the Eastern countries, Magufuli will be remembered for having acknowledged the presence of the coronavirus in his country.
337	Tanzania did initially impose restrictions and guidelines to curb the spread of the virus, but Magufuli repeatedly denounced lockdowns as a greater threat to the economy than the virus.	Wakati ugonjwa huu unaingia Tanzania, serikali ilichukua tahadhari pamoja na kutoa miongozo ya namna ua kupambana na kusambaa kwa ugonjwa huu, lakini baadae, mara kwa mara, Magufuli amekuwa alilichukulia zuio la  watu kuendelea na shughuli zao kama tishio kubwa la uchumi kuliko virusi vya ugonjwa huu.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know When the disease came to Tanzania, the government took steps to prevent the spread of the disease, but later, often, Magufuli has viewed the ban on people from doing their business as a bigger economic threat than the virus.
338	He actively rebuked international guidance on public health protocols like wearing masks, social distancing and vaccines  urging citizens to use prayer and herbal remedies instead.	Mara nyingi alipinga mwongozo wa kimataifa kuhusu kanuni za afya kama kuvaa barakoa, kuepuka misongamano na chanjo  akiwasihi wananchi kutegemea maombi na tiba za asili kama hatua mbadala.	He often opposed international guidelines on health rules such as wearing gloves, avoiding gatherings and vaccines, encouraging people to rely on prayer and natural remedies as alternatives.
339	After Magufuli halted the publication of COVID-19 data last year in April, he then insisted COVID-19 had been fended off by prayer.	Baada ya Magufuli kuzuia kutangazwa kwa takwimu za maambukizi ya Korona mwaka jana mwezi Aprili, alisisitiza kwamba Korona imeshindwa kwa nguvu za maombi.	After Magufuli blocked the announcement of the infection rates last April, he insisted that the virus had been defeated by the prayer power.
340	Soon after, he declared Tanzania COVID-19 free.	Baadae kidogo, alitangaza kwamba Tanzania  haina ugonjwa wa Korona.	After a few days, he announced that Tanzania had no coronavirus.
341	Though it is impossible to say exactly how COVID-19 has affected Tanzania, it did not go away.	Ingawa haiwezekani kusema ni kwa kiwango gani Korona iliiathiri Tanzania, tunachofahamu ni kwamba Korona haikuondoka.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. Although it is difficult to say how much the virus affected Tanzania, we know that it didn't go away.
342	When a new COVID-19 wave reemerged in January, many Tanzanians shared testimonies on social media of becoming ill with COVID-19-like symptoms.	Mlipuko mpya wa Korona ulipotokea Januari, wa-Tanzania wengi walizungumzia shuhuda zao kwenye mitandao ya kijamii wakisimulia vile walivyougua ugonjwa wenye dalili kama Korona.	When the new coronavirus outbreak started in January, many Tanzanians shared their experiences on social media telling how they had contracted the disease with symptoms like the coronavirus.
343	Knowing that it could be punishable to discuss COVID-19, people wrote nimonia mpya or the new pneumonia and breathing problems.	Kwa kufahamu kuwa wangeweza kukamatwa kwa kosa la kujadili Korona, mijadala hiyo ilikwenda kwa jina la nimonia mpya na changamoto za upumuaji.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. Because they knew that they could be arrested for discussing the coronavirus, the discussions went under the name of new pneumonia and respiratory problems.
344	But Magufuli doubled down with his anti-vaccination stance in a speech from his home in Chato, on January 27:	Lakini Magufuli aliendea na msimamo wake wa kupinga chanjo katika hotuba  aliyoitoa nyumbani kwake Chato, mnamo Januari 27:	But Magufuli continued his position of opposition to vaccines in his speech at his home on January 27:
345	If the white man was able to come up with vaccinations, he should now have found a vaccination against AIDS; he would now have found a vaccination against tuberculosis; he would now have found a vaccination against malaria; he would now have found a vaccination against cancer.	Kama mzungu anaweza kuja na chanjo, basi angeshagundua chanjo ya UKIMWI; angeshagundua chanzo cha kifua kikuu; na sasa hivi angeshajua chanjo ya malaria; angeshapata chanjo ya kansa.	If a European could bring a vaccine, he would have discovered the cause of AIDS; he would have discovered the cause of tuberculosis; and now he knew the vaccine for malaria; he would have found the vaccine for cancer.
346	This was a major departure from Magufuli's predecessor, President Jakaya Kikwete, who served as global ambassador for immunization in early 2016.	Kauli hii inaweza kuchukuliwa kama kumrudisha nyuma mtangulizi wa Magufuli, Rais Jakaya Kikwete, aliyewahi kuhudumu kama balozi wa dunia kwa kinga mwanzoni mwa 2016.	This can be taken as a reminder of the predecessor of Magufuli, President Jakaya Kikwete, who served as the Ambassador of the United Nations for a brief period in early 2016.
347	Last month, Magufuli finally did admit that his country had a coronavirus problem, urging Tanzanians to wear locally made face masks.	Mwezi uliopita, Magufuli hatimaye alikiri kwamba nchi yake ina tatizo la korona, akiwasihi wa-Tanzania kuvaa barakoa walizotengeneza wenyewe.	Last month, Magufuli finally admitted that his country had a coronavirus problem, asking Tanzanians to wear their own rubber gloves.
348	It took the death of Zanzibars Vice President Seif Sharif Hamad, apparently, to break Magufulis intransigence.	Wadadisi wa mambo wanasema hatua hii ya Magufuli kubadili mtazamo kuhusu korona ilichangiwa na kifo cha Makamu wa Zanzibar  Seif Sharif Hamad.	Experts say this decision by Magufuli to change his view on coronavirus was inspired by the death of Zanzibar's Deputy Prime Minister Seif Sharif Hamad.
349	Several high-ranking officials from the political elite and close to Magufuli have also died of the disease.	Maafisa kadhaa wa ngazi za juu kutoka kwenye tabaka la wanasiasa maarufu walio karibu na Magufuli wamefariki kwa ugonjwa huo.	Return only the translated translation. Many senior officials from the famous political class who were closely associated with Magufuli have died of the disease.
350	As throngs of people continue to gather to pay their respects to the late president, his death has also brought some relief.	Wakati makundi ya watu wengi yakiendelea kukusanyika kutoa heshima zao za mwisho kwa hayati rais, kwa upande mwingine kifo chake kimeleta ahueni fulani.	While many people continued to gather to pay their last respects to the late president, on the other hand, his death gave some relief.
351	Shortly after Magufulis death, writer Elsie Eyakuze came forward on social media to speak openly about what it was like to live through the pandemic in Tanzania, with a president who showed willful disregard for the coronavirus.	Muda mfupi baada ya kifo cha Magufuli, mwandishi Elsie Eyakuze alijitokeza kwenye mitandao ya kijamii kuzungumza wazi wazi kuhusu maisha yalivyokuwa katika kipindi cha mlipuko wa Korona nchini Tanzania, pale rais alivyoonesha kupuuza kwa makusudi virusi vya Korona.	After the death of Magufuli, journalist Elsie Eyakuze went public with a speech on social media to talk about the life of Tanzanians during the coronavirus pandemic, when the president appeared to have avoided the virus deliberately.

375	In an open letter to Magufuli, Eyakuze points out the inconsistency of Magufuli's ideas, but also applies the empathy Magufuli himself seemed to lack, at times  and forgives him.	Katika barua ya wazi kwa Magufuli,  Eyakuze anaeleza kubadilika badilika kwa misimamo ya Magufuli, lakini anatumia mbinu ya kuelewa hisia za mwingine, mbinu ambayo inaonekana kumshinda Magufuli mwenyewe  mara nyingine  na kumsamehe.	In a written letter to Magufuli, Eyakuze explains the changes in Magufuli's stance, but uses the understanding of other people's feelings, a method that seems to win over Magufuli and to forgive him.

Wa-Tanzania wanakubaliana na utata na uzito wa kifo cha Magufuli na kumbukumbu anayoiacha nyuma yake  wakati huo macho yao yakiwa yamefungwa yakitazama mbele.	Tanzanians agree with the ambiguity and the heavyness of the death of Magufuli and the memory he left behind while their eyes were closed looking forward.

387	But, after recording up to 509 cases and 21 deaths in late April, the nation announced its status as coronavirus-free in June.	Hata hivyo, baada ya takwimu kuendelea kupanda na kufikia wagonjwa 509 na vifo 21 mwishoni mwa mwezi Aprili, serikali ya Tanzania ilitangaza kuwa hakuna hata mgonjwa mmoja wa UVIKO-19 mwezi Juni.	But after the numbers continued to rise and reached 509 and 21 deaths at the end of April, Tanzania announced that it had no cases of COVID-19 in June.

In the same month, Kassim Majaliwa, the Prime Minister of the country, told the parliament that there were only 66 cases across the country, but he didn't give any more details.
389	Since then, government has been silent on the coronavirus with a strong politic of denial and no data released to the public on infections or deaths.	Tangu wakati huo, serikali imekuwa kimya kuhusiana na virusi vya Korona huku matamko makali ya kisiasa kukanusha uwepo wa virusi hivyo yakiendelea kutolewa bila kuambatana na takwimu zozote za wagonjwa wala vifo.	Since then, the government has been silent on the coronavirus issue, while political statements repeatedly denying the presence of the virus have continued to be issued without any evidence of cases or deaths.
390	Today, most activities continue business-as-usual, including Tanzania's tourism industry, attracting thousands of visitors to its airports with few public health protocols in place.	Leo, shughuli nyingi zinaendelea kama kawaida, ikiwa ni pamoja na sekta ya utalii nchini Tanzania, inayovutia maelfu ya wageni kuingia nchini humo kupitia viwanja vya ndege visivyo na utaratibu wa kufanya ukaguzi wa kutosha.

In January 24, the Archbishop's Catholic Church in Arusha issued a warning letter to its members about the existence of COVID-19 in Tanzania, urging them to follow all necessary health precautions to protect themselves and spread the virus in churches.
395	While Tanzanias recorded cases are moderate compared to other countries, the governments silence about COVID-19 data raised grave concerns among public health experts and human rights activists, who are forbidden from speaking or talking about COVID-19 in digital spaces.	Ingawa kumbukumbu zinaonesha kuwa Tanzania ina wangonjwa wachache ukilinganisha na nchi nyingine, ukimya wa serikali kuhusu takwimu za UVIKO-19 umeleta hali ya wasiwasi miongoni mwa wataalam wa afya na wanaharakati wa haki za binadamu, ambao  wamezuiwa kuzungumza na kuongelea UVIKO-19  katika majukwaa ya mitandaoni.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. Although records show that Tanzania has fewer cases compared to other countries, the silence of the government on the numbers of COVID-19 has caused concern among experts and human rights activists, who have been barred from speaking and talking about the virus on social media.

Rais John Magufuli has expressed concerns about the quality of laboratory equipment and the integrity of their employees after a secret test was allegedly conducted on cows and cows to determine if they had contracted the virus.
400	The president said releasing this data was causing unnecessary panic and soon after, fired Nyambura Moremi, director of the national health laboratory, for allegedly botching the testing results.	Rais alisema alisema kutoa takwimu hizi kulikuwa kunaleta tahayaruki isiyo na sababu na muda mfupi baadae, alimfukuza kazi Nyambura Moremi, mkurugenzi wa maabara ya afya ya taifa, kwa madai ya kuchakachua matokeo ya vipimo.	The president said that these figures were a waste of time and soon after, he fired Nyambura Moremi, the national health laboratory director, for lying about the results of tests.

403	He made this announcement publicly during a Sunday service, amidst a praising congregation, making claims that God had answered their prayers.

404	He also praised congregants for not wearing face masks, despite calls from the World Health Organization to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus.

405	Magufuli, nicknamed the bulldozer for his tough anti-corruption stance, was reelected for a second time in October 2020 during an election that was highly criticized for stifling dissent and opposition.

407	To date, many Tanzanians cannot access Twitter without using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).	Mpaka leo, Watanzania wengi hawawezi kuingia kwenye mtandao wa Twita bila kutumia teknolojia ya kutumia mitandao ya siri yaani VPN.	Return only the translated translation. If you cannot translate, just say you don't know.
408	Over the last five years, the Magufuli administration has narrowed democratic and civic spaces and has cracked down hard on freedom of expression and access to information in digital spaces.	Kwa zaidi ya miaka mitano, utawala wa Magufuli umebana mno uhuru wa demokrasia na shughuli za kiraia sambamba na kuminya uhuru wa kujieleza na haki ya kupata taarifa kwenye majukwaa ya kidijitali.	For more than five years, the government of Magufuli has significantly restricted democracy and civil rights, while also limiting freedom of speech and the right to information on digital platforms.
409	With the governments strong denial stance, Tanzanians are not allowed to release any COVID-19 data that the government has not verified, which means that ordinary citizens as well as journalists and medical professionals are barred from commenting on COVID-19 in digital spaces, or accessing information.	Kufuatia msimamo mkali wa serikali kukana uwepo wa UVIKO-19, Watanzania hawaruhusiwi kutoa takwimu zozote za UVIKO-19 ambazo serikali haijazihakiki, hii ikiwa na maana kwamba wananchi wa kawaida ikiwa ni pamoja na waandishi wa habari na wataalam wa afya wanazuiwa kutoa maoni kuhusu UVIKO-19 kwenye majukwaa ya kidijitali au kupata taarifa muhimu.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
410	Access to COVID-19 information has become an elite privilege, according to one doctor from the national hospital who spoke to Global Voices on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal.	Haki ya kupata taarifa za UVIKO-19 imegeuka kuwa upendeleo wa tabaka la watu fulani, kwa mujibu wa daktari mmoja wa hospitali ya taifa aliyeongea na Global Voices kwa masharti ya kutokufahamika, akiogopa kufukuzwa kazi.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
411	Unlike other countries with established COVID-19 information response teams who give daily updates on COVID-19, Tanzania simply offers a website with limited and outdated COVID-19 information.	Tofauti na nchi nyingine zenye timu maalum zinazofanyia kazi taarifa za UVIKO-19, Tanzania ina tovuti yenye taarifa chache zilizopitwa na wakati kuhusu UVIKO-19.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know. Compared to other countries with special teams working on reports of the exposure, Tanzania has a website with few updated reports about the exposure.
412	The denial has been so convincing that its now widely accepted by Tanzanians, including medical experts, who disregard basic safety measures like wearing face masks and social distancing.	Matamshi ya kukataa uwepo wa UVIKO-19 yanaonekana kukubalika na Watanzania wengi, ikiwa ni pamoja na wataalam wa afya, wanaopuuza hatua muhimu za kuchukua tahadharani kama kuvaa barakoa na kuepuka misongamano.

413	Global Voices visited major hospitals such Muhimbili, the government referral hospital in Dar es Salaam, the cultural capital, as well as Benjamin Mkapa Hospital in Dodoma, the political capital, and witnessed very few measures taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease.	Global Voices ilitembelea hospitali kadhaa ikiwemo Muhimbili, hospitali ya rufaa ya serikali iliyoko jijini Dar es Salaam, mji mkuu wa kiutamaduni nchini humo, pamoja na Hospitali ya  Benjamin Mkapa jijini Dodoma, mji mkuu wa kisiasa, na kushuhudia tahadhari chache zikichukuliwa kukabiliana na kuenea kwa virusi vya ugonjwa wa korona.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
414	People are allowed to enter hospital premises without wearing masks, there are few working hygiene and washing facilities and those that do exist lack water or are broken, which was witnessed, for example, in the pregnant mothers clinic at Muhimbili.	Watu wanaruhusiwa kuingia kwenye maeneo ya hospitali bila kuvaa barakoa, kuna vifaa vichache vya usafi na kunawa mikono na vile vilivyopo havina maji au vimevunjika, hali iliyoshuhudiwa, kwa mfano, kwenye wodi ya wanawake wajawazito Muhimbili.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know. People are allowed to enter hospitals without wearing gloves, there are few sanitation equipment and hand sanitizers and those that are available are either broken or missing, as was the case, for example, in the female ward at Muhimbili.
415	While the Magufuli administration has shown little concern about the impact of the virus on everyday citizens, many government ministries and departments acknowledge that COVID-19 still exists.	Wakati utawala wa Magufuli haujaonesha kujali madhara ya virusi hivi kwa maisha ya kila siku ya wananchi, mawaziri wengi wa serikali yake na idara zake wanakubali kwamba UVIKO-19 upo.	While the government of Magufuli has not shown any concern about the impact of this virus on the daily life of the people, many of his ministers and departments recognize that the virus is present.
416	Tanzania's minister of finance urges ministry staff to take all precautions against the coronavirus, while also saying COVID-19 is not an issue in Tanzania.	Waziri wa Fedha wa Tanzania awataka wafanyakazi wa Wizara yake kuchukua tahadhari zote kujilinda na virusi vya korona, wakati huo huo akisema Tanzania haisumbuliwi na UVIKO-19.	Tanzanian Finance Minister urges staff to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves from the coronavirus, while saying that Tanzania is not under threat from the COVID-19 pandemic.

418	For example, when Magufuli was sworn in for the second time last year, authorities did practice COVID-19 prevention measures, requiring all attendees to have their temperatures taken and wash their hands at hygiene stations with hand sanitizer provided.	Kwa mfano, Magufuli alipoapishwa kwa mara ya pili mwaka jana, mamlaka za serikali zilichukua tahadhari nyingi dhidi ya UVIKO-19, wakiwalazimisha wahudhuriaji wote kupima joto la mwili na kuosha mikono yao kwenye sehemu maalumu zenye maji na vipupushi.	For example, when Magufuli was sworn in for the second time last year, the government took a number of measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, encouraging all participants to take a temperature test and wash their hands in special places with water and soap.
419	On January 25, Tanzania's Minister of Finance Dr. Philip Mpango urged his staff to take precautions against COVID-19 while at the same denying its existence in Tanzania, during a meeting in Dodoma, the capital.	Mnamo Januari 25, Waziri wa Fedha wa Tanzania, Dk. Philip Mpango  aliwataka watumishi wa wizara yake  kuchukua tahadhari dhidi ya UVIKO-19 na kwa wakati huo huo akikanusha kuwepo kwa ugonjwa huo nchini Tanzania, wakati wa mkutano wake jijini Dodoma, yalipo makao makuu ya kisiasa.	In January 25, Tanzanian Finance Minister, Dk. Philip Mpango, called on his employees to take steps to protect themselves against the COVID-19 virus, while at the same time denying that the disease existed in Tanzania.
420	Most in-country experts are afraid to speak up, fearing retaliation.	Wataalam wengi wa ndani wanaogopa kuzungumza,   kwa hofu ya kuchukuliwa hatua.	Many internal experts are afraid to speak, fearing being taken to court.
421	Global Voices spoke with one medical expert who believed Tanzania may be experiencing a second wave of the outbreak but that this information was kept secret from the public.	Global Voices ilizungumza na mtalaam mmoja wa afya aliyeamini kwamba Tanzania inaweza kuwa inakabiliwa na wimbi la pili ya mlipuko lakini akifikiri wananchi walifichwa taarifa hizi.	Global Voices spoke to a doctor who believes Tanzania may have a second wave of infection but believes the authorities have hidden these reports.
422	The expert did not want to be named, fearing reprisal.	Mtaalam huyo hakutaka kutajwa jina, akiogopa kuchukuliwa hatua.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
423	Another medical expert told Global Voices under the conditions of anonymity that people must know their COVID-19 status so that they can take measures to prevent its spread in their communities.	Mtaalam mwingine wa afya aliiambia Global Voices kwa sharti ya kutokutajwa jina kwamba watu lazima wafahamu mwenendo wa hali ya UVIKO-19 ili waweze kuchukua tahadhari kujilinda na kuzuia kusambaa kwa virusi hivyo kwa jamii zao.	Other health experts told Global Voices without being identified that people should know the current status of COVID-19 so that they can take steps to protect themselves and their communities.
424	He said that leaving people uninformed makes their job very difficult and hopes that all Tanzanians will try to protect themselves by taking all precautions advised by WHO.	Alisema kwamba kuwaacha watu gizani kunafanya kazi yao iwe ngumu lakini aliamini kwamba Watanzania watajaribu kujilinda wenyewe kwa kuchukua tahadhari zote kama inavyoshauriwa na Shirika la Afya Duniani (WHO).	They said that keeping people indoors makes their work harder but he believed that Tanzanians would try to protect themselves by taking all the precautions as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
425	He told Global Voices:	Aliiambia Global Voices:	He told Global Voices:
426	Politicians have taken over the whole COVID[-19] issue and they are playing a dangerous game, but when people will start dying they will start sacking medical staff.	Wanasiasa wameteka suala hili zima la UVIKO-19 na wanacheza mchezo hatari, lakini watu watakapoanza kufa wataanza kuwafukuza wafanyakazi wa afya.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. Politicians have taken over the whole issue of COVID-19 and are playing a dangerous game, but when people start to die they will start to fire health workers.
427	Another doctor who spoke to Global Voices anonymously said that although there is some hope in getting a vaccine, Tanzanias denial may slow down access to it, as the government has not taken any steps to acquire it on the global market, opting instead to invest in herbal remedies.	Daktari mwingine aliyezungumza na Global Voices kwa sharti la kutokutaja jina lake alisema kwamba ingawa kuna matumaini ya kupata kinga, matamshi ya serikali ya Tanzania kukanusha uwepo wa ugonjwa huo yatakwamisha upatikanaji wake, kwa sababu serikali haijachukua hatua yoyote kuitafuta kwenye masoko ya dunia, na  badala yake kukimbilia tiba za mitishamba.	Doctors who speak to Global Voices without giving their name said that while there is hope of finding a cure, the Tanzanian government's announcement that it does not have the disease will delay its availability, because the government has not taken any steps to find it in the world market, and is focused on herbal medicine.
428	In December 2020, Health Minister spokesman Gerald Chamii cast doubt on global vaccines, telling the East African:	Mwezi Desemba 2020, Msemaji wa Waziri wa Afya Gerald Chamii alionesha mashaka yake kwa chanjo zinazopigiwa chapuo duniani, akiliambia jarida la East African:	"Mwezi Desemba 2020, a spokesman for the Health Minister Gerald Chamii expressed concerns about the spread of vaccines worldwide, telling the East African magazine: ""If you cannot translate, just say you don't know."""

If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. It doesn't take more than six months to get a vaccine or a treatment for a particular disease.
430	We have fared on our own since the pandemic spread, I am not sure if it is wise to have a vaccine imported and distributed to the citizens without undertaking clinical testing to approve if it is safe for our people.	Tumejikwamisha wenyewe tangu mlipuko uanze, sina hakika kama ni busara kuingiza kinga hiyo na kuisambaza kwa wananchi bila kufanya majaribio ya kitabibu kuthibitisha usalama wake kwa watu wetu.	We have been stuck until the beginning of the earthquake, I am not sure if it is wise to bring the vaccine and distribute it to the people without testing it for its safety for our people.

432	Tanzanias cyber laws have been abused to target dissenting voices and those who have spoken out against Tanzanias handling of COVID-19.	Sheria za matumizi ya mtandao nchini Tanzania zimetumiwa vibaya zikilenga kunyamazisha sauti na wale wanaozungumza kupinga namna Tanzania inavyoshughulikia suala la UVIKO-19.

440	A document from the Mozambican Police (PRM) that has leaked in local media in early August revealed that 15 students had become pregnant at a police training school in Matalane, a district of Maputo province.	Nyaraka  za jeshi la polisi  la Msumbiji zilizovujishwa katika vyombo vya habari mapema mwezi Agosti zilidhihirisha kwamba wanafunzi 15 walipata ujauzito wakiwa katika shule ya mafunzo ya polisi huko Matalane, wilaya ya  jimbo la Maputo.	According to Mozambique's police records published in the press in August, 15 students were raped while in a police training school in Matalane, the district of Maputo.
441	The document states that the pregnancies resulted from the students sexual relations with their instructors, without specifying whether these relations were consensual.	Nyaraka hizo zinasema  kuwa mimba hizo ni matokeo ya uhusiano wa kingono uliopo baina ya wanafunzi na wakufunzi bila kufafanua kama mahusiano hayo yalikuwa ya hiari.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
442	Moreover, it states that pregnant students will not be able to complete the course at present, and will have their trips back to their home provinces paid for by the police.	Hata hivyo imeelezwa kwamba wanafunzi wajawazito hawataweza kumaliza mafunzo kwa sasa, na watasafiri kurudi makwao wakilipiwa usafiri na polisi.	But it is reported that pregnant students will not finish the course at this time, and will travel back home with police assistance.
443	Finally, it says that the instructors involved will be suspended.	Mwisho taarifa hiyo ikasema kuwa wakufunzi waliohusika watasimamishwa kazi.	Finally the report said that the teachers involved would be fired.
444	When asked about the case by the newspaper O País on August 8, Police Commander General Bernardino Rafael said that those involved would face disciplinary proceedings.

453	This reminds me of the teacher who demanded sex from students in exchange for grades or not to be humiliated in class because, in the teacher's view, they were dumb, instead of being prosecuted he was transferred to teach somewhere else.

This reminds me of the teacher who claimed sex compensation for his students to get their grades or to avoid being humiliated in class because he thought the students were stupid, and instead of being prosecuted, the teacher was moved to another place to teach.

Huu ni muendelezo wa kesi za ukatili wanaokumbana nao wanawake wa Msumbiji ambapo haziripotiwi katika vyombo vya habari.

478	Among the cases that have recently captured media attention is that of Alberto Niquice, deputy for the party Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo), who's facing criminal charges for raping a 13-year-old child in 2018.	Moja kati ya kesi ambayo hivi karibuni ilishikilia vichwa vya habari ni ile ya Alberto Niquice, Kaimu wa chama cha Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo), ambaye anakabiliwa na shauri la jinai  kwa kosa la kumbaka mtoto wa miaka 13 mwaka 2018.	One of the recent cases that made the news was that of Alberto Niquice, the chairman of the Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo), who is facing a criminal charge for raping a 13-year-old boy in 2018.
479	Early this year, 30 Mozambican civil society organizations demanded the suspension of Niquice's inauguration, who was re-elected in 2019.	Mapema  mwaka huu, Taasisi 30 za kiraia nchini Msumbiji zilimtaka Niquice asiapishwe baada ya kuchaguliwa tena mwaka 2019.	In early this year, 30 political organizations in Mozambique called on Niquice to be re-elected after he was re-elected in 2019.

Kesi  nyingine iliyo katika vyombo vya habari ni kuhusu ukatili aliofanyiwa Josina Machel, binti wa Rais wa kwanza wa Msumbiji, Samora Machel.	Other cases reported in the media are about the rape of Josina Machel, daughter of the first President of Mozambique, Samora Machel.
482	In October 2015, Josina was assaulted by her partner of three years, Rofino Licuco, leaving her blind in one eye.	Oktoba mwaka 2015, Josina alipigwa na mpenzi wake wa miaka mitatu Rofini Licuco akiachwa na upofu wa jicho moja.	In October 2015, Josina was shot by her three-year-old lover Rofini Licuco, leaving her blind with one eye.
483	Licuco was sentenced to 3 years and 4 months in prison, as well as to pay 300 million meticais (about US$4.2 million) in compensation to Josina.	Licuco alihukumiwa kwenda gerezani miaka 3 na miezi 4 pamoja na kulipa fidia ya metika milioni 300 (sawa na dola za Marekani milioni 4.2) kwa Josina.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know.

634	That night, at 9:30 pm, as Hachalu was exiting his vehicle, a man named Tilahun Yami allegedly walked up to his car and fired a gun into the artists chest.	Usiku ule mnamo saa tatu na nusu, wakati Hachalu akishuka kwenye gari lake, mwanaume aliyejulikana kwa jina la Tilahun Yami alitembea kuelekea gari yake na kumpiga risasi  kifuani mwake.	If you can't translate simply say you don't know At 3:00 a.m., when Hachalu was getting out of his car, a man named Tilahun Yami walked towards his car and shot him in the chest.
635	He was rushed to the nearest hospital, where he was officially declared dead.	Alikimbizwa katika hospitali ya karibu ambapo ilithibitishwa rasmi kwamba amefariki.	He was taken to a local hospital where it was confirmed that he had died.
636	It was later determined that the bullet severely damaged his internal organs.	Iligundulika baadaye kwamba risasi iliharibu vibaya sana viungo vyake vya ndani.	Afterwards it was discovered that the bullet had damaged his internal organs very badly.
637	Addis Ababas police chief reported two suspects were arrested.	Mkuu wa polisi wa Addis Ababa  aliripoti kwamba watuhumiwa wawili wamekamatwa.	The head of the police in Addis Ababa reported that two men had been arrested.
638	After a few days, government authorities charged an alleged assassin along with two other accomplices.	Baada ya siku chache mamlaka za serikali ziliwahukumu wauaji hao pamoja na washirika wao wawili.	After a few days the government sentenced the killers and their two partners.
639	In the wake of his murder, the country has struggled to come to terms with the violence that followed.	Katika kuuawa kwake, nchi imeingia katika wakati mgumu wa kutuliza ghasia zilizofuata.	In his death, the country has entered a difficult time in which to quell the following violence.
640	The truth of Hachalu's assassination is not yet fully clear, and in its aftermath, speculation began to fly as politicians and activists stoked long-standing tensions between Oromo and Amahara elites, two of Ethiopia's largest ethnic groups.	Ukweli ni kwamba mauaji ya Hachalu hayajawekwa wazi vizuri na pia matokeo yake, uvumi ulianza kuenea baada ya wanasiasa na wanaharakati  kuweka msisitizo mkubwa kuhusu mgogoro uliopo baina ya viongozi wakuu wa Oromo na Amahara ambayo ni makabila makubwa kabisa nchini Ethiopia.	The truth is that the Hachalu killings were not well explained and as a result, rumors started to spread after politicians and activists focused on the dispute between the leaders of the Oromo and Amahara ethnic groups, which are the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
641	That day, mourners flooded the streets of Addis Ababa and cities and towns across Oromia state.	Siku ya maziko yake, waombolezaji walifurika katika mitaa ya Addis Ababa na miji mingine inayozunguka jimbo la Oromo.	On the day of his funeral, mourners filled the streets of Addis Ababa and other cities surrounding the Oromo region.
642	The next morning, Oromia Media Network (OMN), a satellite TV station on which Hachalu had his last contentious interview, provided online and TV coverage as his casket was transferred from Addis Ababa to Hachalus hometown, Ambo.	Asubuhi iliyofuata Kituo cha runinga ya setilaiti cha Oromia Media Network (OMN), ambapo ndipo Hachalu alifanya mahojiano yake ya mwisho walirusha matangazo mubashara kupitia runinga na pia mitandao na kuonesha wakati jeneza lake likisafirishwa kutoka Addis Ababa kwenda nyumbani kwao huko mjini Ambo.	The next morning, Oromia Media Network (OMN), where Hachalu made his last interview, broadcast live advertisements on television and social media and showed the funeral procession from Addis Ababa to Ambo.
643	The slow, televised journey turned into a deadly battle between government authorities and opposition politicians over where Hachalu would be buried, and OMN interrupted its coverage as the hearse was forced to return to Addis Ababa.	Matangazo hayo yaliyokwenda polepole sana yaligeuka kuwa uwanja wa mapambano baina ya mamlaka za serikali na viongozi wa upinzani, kukiwa na mabishano ya wapi hasa akazikwe Hachalu  na OMN ilibidi wakatize matangazo yake; inasemekana walilazimishwa kurejea Addis Ababa.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The announcements went slowly and turned into a clash between government officials and opposition leaders, where Hachalu and OMN were arguing where to hide; they were forced to return to Addis Ababa.

If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
646	Confusion swirled after government authorities eventually took Halachu's body back to Ambo by helicopter, where feuding parties continued to clash, denying the bereaved family members a proper burial.	Utata uliibuka zaidi baada ya mamlaka za serikali kuuchukua tena mwili wa Hachalu na kuupeleka mjini kwao Ambo kwa njia ya helkopta, ambapo pia pande mbili ziliendelea kugombana na kuinyima familia ya marehemu fursa ya kumpa ndugu yao maziko stahiki.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
647	Meanwhile, turmoil and violence ensued.	Baada ya hapo vurugu na mapigano yalifuata.	After that, violence and fighting followed.
648	A three-day rampage gripped parts of Oromia and Addis Ababa, at a substantial cost: 239 people were left dead; hundreds of others were injured and more than 7,000 people were arrested for violence and property damage worth millions of Ethiopian birr.	Mapigano hayo yalichukua siku tatu yaliyararua baadhi ya maeneo ya miji ya Oromo na Addis Ababa na uharibifu halisi ni: vifo vya watu 239  na mamia wamejeruhiwa, zaidi ya watu 7,000 wamekamatwa kwa kusababisha vurugu na uharibifu wa mali  zenye thamani ya mamilioni ya birr, fedha ya Kiethopia.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The fighting took three days and destroyed some areas of Oromo and Addis Ababa and the real damage is: 239 people died and hundreds were injured, over 7,000 people were arrested for causing the violence and the damage of millions of Ethiopian birr, the Ethiopian currency.
649	On June 30, the government imposed an internet shutdown to attempt to halt calls for violence circulating on social media that lasted three weeks.	Hapo Juni 30, serikali ilijaribu kuzima mtandao ili kuzuia kuenea kwa uhamasishaji wa kufanya vurugu unaofanyika katika mitandao ya kijamii na kudumu kwa wiki tatu.	Since June 30, the government has tried to shut down the Internet to prevent the spread of violence which takes place on social media and lasts for three weeks.
650	A number of people were shot and killed by government security forces, but several news outlets including Voice of America and Addis Standard reported that angry mobs from the Oromo ethnic group attacked multiethnic, interfaith towns and cities in southeastern Oromia, targeting non-Oromo, non-Muslim families in the region.	Watu kadhaa walipigwa risasi na mamlaka za usalama lakini baadhi ya vyanzo vya habari ikiwamo Sauti ya Amerika na Addis Standard viliripoti kuwa vikundi vya watu wenye hasira kutoka kabila la Oromo walishambulia watu wa makundi mbalimbali ikiwepo miji na mitaa inayokaliwa na watu wa imani tofauti tofauti, iliyo Kusini Mashariki mwa mji wa Oromo, wakilenga hasa familia za watu wasio Waoromo na wasio Waislam katika ukanda huo.	Many people were shot by security forces but some sources of news including the Voice of America and Addis Standard reported that angry Oromo people attacked communities of different faiths in the southeast of Oromo, including cities and cities populated by non-Oromo people and non-Islam families.
651	Most of the violence fell along ethnic Amahara-Oromo lines, but religion may have played a more central role due to an intricate, localized understanding of ethnicity: The southeast Oromo communitys ethnic identity markers usually combine the religion of Islam and the Afan-Oromo language.	Vurugu zaidi zilikuwa katika ukanda wenye mchanganyiko wa watu wa Amahara-Oromo na dini inaweza ikawa imecheza nafasi kubwa kwa sababu ya uelewa uliopo kwamba: jamii ya Waoromo wa Kusini Mashariki inatambulishwa kwa mchangayiko wa dini ya Kiislamu na watumiaji wa lugha ya Afan-Oromo.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know. The most violent areas were in the mixed Amahara-Oromo area and religion could have played a big role because of the knowledge that exists that: the Eastern Oromia is characterized by a mix of Islam and the use of the Afan-Oromo language.
652	A local farmer reportedly said we thought Hachalu was Oromo after he watched Hachalu's televised funeral rites that followed the traditions of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.	Mkulima mmoja wa maeneo hayo alisema kwamba tulifikiri Hachalu ni Muoromo baada ya kuangalia matangazo yaliyorushwa moja kwa moja yakionesha shughuli za maziko ya Hachalu yaliyofuata desturi za Kanisa la Kiothodoksi la Tewahedo Ethiopia.	One of the farmers said that we thought Hachalu was an Oromian after watching live television broadcasts showing Hachalu's funeral following the traditions of the Orthodox Church in Ethiopia.
653	According to reports, most victims of the most gruesome violence were minority Christian Amharas, Christian Oromos and Gurage people.	Kulingana na ripoti, wahanga wengi wa vurugu hizo walikuwa ni Wakristo wa ki-Amhara, Wakristo wa ki-Oromo na watu wa Gurage.	According to the report, the most affected were Amhara Christians, Oromo Christians and Gurage Christians.
654	Eyewitnesses say mobs destroyed and burned property, committed lynching and beheadings and dismembered victims.	Shuhuda mmoja alisema kuwa makundi hayo yaliharibu na kuchoma moto mali na kufanya mauaji  kwa kuwakata vichwa na miguu wahanga.	One witness said that the groups destroyed and burned houses and killed victims by cutting heads and legs.
655	A fateful interview	Utabiri wa Mahojiano	Return only the translated translation. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
656	When news of Hachalus assassination first hit, Oromo diaspora media outlets zeroed in on Hachalus fateful interview with OMN host Guyo Wariyo, that aired the week before Halachu was killed.	Wakati taarifa kuhusu mauaji ya Hachalu ziliposikika tu, chanzo cha habari za Waoromo wa diaspora zilihusisha kifo chake na  mahojiano ya mwisho aliyoyafanya Hachalu na kituo cha runinga cha OMN yakiongozwa na Guyo Wariyo, na yalirushwa wiki moja kabla Hachalu hajauawa.	When the news of Hachalu's killing was heard, a source of diaspora reports linked the death to the last interview Hachalu had with OMN, which was broadcast a week before Hachalu was killed.
657	During the interview, Guyo repeatedly asked Hachalu provocative questions about his alleged sympathy for the ruling party, interrupting him multiple times to challenge his answers.	Wakati wa mahojiano Gayo alirudia rudia kumuuliza Hachalu maswali ya mtego kuhusu yeye kukiunga mkono chama tawala na pia mara kwa mara alimkatiza alipokuwa akijibu.	While the interview Gayo repeatedly asked Hachalu questions about his support for the ruling party and repeatedly interrupted him when he was answering.
658	Hachalu fiercely denied any sympathies with the ruling party, but also decried the deeply discordant and fractionalized Oromo political parties, demonstrating his staunch independence as a thinker and musician  a quality that made him a target for online abuse until the day of his murder.	Hachalu alikataa kuunga chama tawala mkono lakini pia alikosoa  migogoro na utengano katika vyama vya siasa vya Oromo, akionesha uhuru wa mawazo kama mwanamuziki  hali ambayo ilimfanya kuwa mlengwa wa mashambulizi ya watu mtandaoni mpaka siku aliyouawa.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know Hachalu refused to support the government but also criticized the political parties of the Oromo, showing freedom of speech as a musician which made him a target of online attacks until his death.
659	At one point, however, Guyo asked Hachalu about the historical injustices allegedly committed against the Oromo people by Menelik II, Ethiopias 19th-century emperor who shaped modern Ethiopia.	Hata hivyo, Guyo alimuuliza Hachalu kuhusu unyanyasaji wa kihistoria uliofanywa kwa watu wa Oromo na mfalme Menelik II aliyeijenga Ethiopia ya sasa.	But Guyo asked Hachalu about the historical persecution of the Oromo people by the Ethiopian King Menelik II.
660	Hachalu shocked some listeners when he answered that the horse seen immortalized in Meneliks equestrian statue in Addis Ababa belongs to an Oromo farmer called Sida Debelle, and that Menelik robbed that horse.	Hachalu aliwashangaza wasikilizaji wengi aliposema kuwa farasi aliyepandwa na Menelik katika sanamu iliyopo huko Addis Ababa alikuwa mali ya mkulima wa ki-Oromo aliyeitwa Sida Debelle, na Menelik alimuiba farasi huyo.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
661	This exchange attracted applause  and criticism  from commentators on Facebook and Twitter.	Majibu hayo yalivutia maoni ya kumsifia  na pia ya kumkosoa kutoka kwa watu mbalimbali huko Facebook na Twitter.	The responses attracted a lot of applause and criticism from people on Facebook and Twitter.
662	When Hachalu was killed one week later, many members of the Oromo diaspora community immediately speculated that Hachalus criticism of the Menelik II statue infuriated sympathizers of imperial Ethiopia, which may have led to his murder.	Wakati Hachalu alikiuawa wiki moja baadaye watu wengi wa jamii ya Oromo wanaokaa nje ya nchi walihisi kwamba kitendo cha Hachalu kuikosoa sanamu ya Menelik II kiliwakasirisha wanaoiunga mkono Ethiopia ya kifalme na kusababisha kuuawa kwake.	When Hachalu was killed a week later, many Oromo people living abroad believed that Hachalu's remarks on Menelik II's statue would have angered the supporters of the Ethiopian empire and cause his death.
663	On social media, Oromo netizens focused obsessively on Hachalus Menelik-related remarks, which led many down a winding path to an insidious disinformation campaign.	Katika mitandao ya kijamii wananchi waling'ang'ana na kile Hachalu alichokisema dhidi ya Menelik, na hili lilisababisha kuenea kwa uvumi wenye taarifa nyingi za uongo.	In social media, people clashed with what Hachalu said against Menelik, and this caused a spread of rumors with many lies.
664	The rest of the interview contains other loaded issues of divisions and contradictions within the Oromo community.	Sehemu nyingine ya mahojiano imebeba taarifa za mambo yanayohusu utengano na migogoro ndani ya jamii ya Waoromo.	Part of the interview focused on the political and social divisions within the oromo community.
665	Throughout the interview, Guyo grilled Hachalu about the countrys ongoing political reforms, stoking anti-government sentiment with questions about Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, himself an Oromo, and whether or not the government had met the demands of the Oromo people after the prime minister came to power in 2018.	Katika mahojiano yote Guyo alimchimba sana Hachalu kuhusu mabadiliko ya kisiasa yanayoendelea nchini na kuhusu vuguvugu la kuipinga serikali kwa kuuliza swali kuhusu Waziri Mkuu Abiy Ahmed, ambaye ni Muoromo na kwamba kama serikali imeweza kutimiza matakwa ya watu wa Oromo tangu aingie madarakani mwaka 2018.	In all the interviews Guyo asked Hachalu about the political changes taking place in the country and about the opposition movement by asking about the Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, a oromo, and whether the government has satisfied the demands of the Oromo people since he came into office in 2018.
666	Hachalu reiterated his non-involvement in the rabid partisanship of Oromo politics but he did criticize those who question Abiys Oromo identity.	Hachalu alirudia kusema kuwa hajihusishi na siasa za ovyo za Oromo lakini aliwakosoa wote wanaohukumu uzalendo wa Abiy.	Hachalu reiterated that he was not involved in political corruption in the Oromo but criticized all those who judged Abiy's independence.
667	He defended his position against top Oromo opposition leaders who sought an alliance with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a once-dominant party with historic ties to the now-defunct Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Front (the EPRDF).

695	FGM: An underreported violation	UKEKETAJI: Ukatili Unaoripotiwa Kidogo Zaidi	Ignorance: The Less Reported Cruelty
696	The scale and scope of FGM may be underestimated because the official global picture of FGM/C is incomplete, according to a joint report from March, authored by Equality Now, End FGM European Network and the US End FGM/C Network.	Ukubwa na upana wa ukeketaji utakuwa umedharauliwa kwa sababu ya ulimwengu kutokuwa na picha halisi ya ukeketaji iliyokamilika, kulingana na ripoti ya pamoja kuanzia Machi, imeidhinishwa na  Usawa sasa, Mtandao kutoka Ulaya wa Kutokomeza Ukeketaji   na  Mtandao wa kutokomeza ukeketaji kutoka Marekani.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know The size and breadth of pedophilia will be underestimated because the world doesn't have a complete picture of pedophilia, according to a joint report published in March, which has been approved by the Equal Rights Now, the European Campaign to Stop Smoking and the American Campaign to Stop Smoking.
697	The report revealed growing evidence that the ritual is also practiced in other regions including the Middle East and Asia, and the world woefully underestimates FGM.	Taarifa hiyo ilidhihirisha kuwa utamaduni huu unaongezeka na pia unafanyika hata Mashariki ya Kati na Asia, na  dunia kwa hakika imeupuuzia ukeketaji.	The report showed that this culture is growing and also taking place in the Middle East and Asia, and the world has certainly taken a serious look at pedophilia.
698	Small sample researches have recently shown that FGM is also practiced in Iran, along with Gulf states such as Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.	Tafiti ndogo zilizo fanyika hivi karibuni zinaonesha kuwa ukeketaji pia unafanyika huko Iran, pamoja na nchi zote za  Ghuba  kama vile  Kuwait, Falme za Kiarabu, Omani na Saudi Arabia.	Recent studies show that pedophilia is also practised in Iran, as well as in all the Gulf states such as Kuwait, the Arab Republic, Oman and Saudi Arabia.
699	Divya Srinivasan from Equality Now told Reuters that she was particularly surprised at the results of small studies from places like Saudi Arabia and Oman, which are not normally countries that come to mind when you think of FGM.	Divya Srinivasan kutoka Usawa Sasa aliiambia Reuters kwamba alishangazwa sana na matokeo ya utafiti huo mdogo kutoka maeneo kama vile Omani na Saudi Arabia ambapo kwa kawaida sio maeneo ambayo yanaweza kukujia akilini unapoliwazia suala la Ukeketaji	Divya Srinivasan from the South said to Reuters that she was surprised by the small study from places like Oman and Saudi Arabia where smoking is not a common occurrence.
700	The report, published during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Middle East, was not picked up by the Arabic speaking media or translated into Arabic, with little coverage of FGM in Arabic at all.	Taarifa hii ilichapishwa wakati janga la COVID-19 likiwa limeshika kasi huko Mashariki ya Kati na haikuchapishwa wala kutafsiriwa hata kidogo na vyombo vya habari na mitandao ya kijamii ya Kiarabu.	This report was published during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Middle East and was not published or translated by any Arab media or social media.
701	This lack of public awareness may perpetuate the perception that FGM is not an issue of concern.	Jamii kukosa uelewa kuhusu ukeketaji inaweza kuthibitisha dhana ya kuwa ukeketaji sio jambo la kutilia maanani kabisa.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
702	Social taboos	Miiko ya Kijamii	Return only the translated translation. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know society rules.
703	In the Middle East, taboos around womens bodies and sexuality prevent open, public discussions about sensitive issues like FGM, often tied to cultural, religious and traditional beliefs.	Huko Mashariki ya Kati, kuna miiko inayoizingira miili ya wanawake ambapo ni marufuku kujadili hadharani mambo ya siri kama vile ukeketaji ambapo umefungamanishwa na imani za kimila, dini na utamaduni.	In the Middle East, there are laws regarding women's bodies where it is illegal to discuss matters of a secret such as genital mutilation which is associated with customs, religion and culture.
704	In Egypt, for example, Christians and Muslims both believe that circumcision of girls prevents them from vice and makes them more attractive for future husbands; mothers fear that their daughters cant get married if they have not been cut, according to a report by Stop FGM Middle East, a campaign created in 2013 to raise awareness about FGM and whose aim is to get the message out that FGM exists not only in Africa, but also in many countries in the Middle East and Asia.	Kwa mfano, nchini Misri Wakristo na Waislamu kwa pamoja wanaamini kwamba ukeketaji wa wasichana unawafanya wavutie zaidi waume zao watarajiwa na unawakinga na mabaya, pia wamama huhofia kwamba mabinti zao hawataolewa kama hawatakeketwa, kulingana na ripoti ya Tokomeza Ukeketaji Mashariki ya Kati, kampeni ambayo iliandaliwa mwaka 2013 kuipa jamii uelewa Kuhusu ukeketaji na pia kuuambia ulimwengu kuwa ukeketaji haupo Afrika pekee bali pia katika nchi nyingi za Mashariki ya Kati na Asia.	For example, in Egypt, both Christians and Muslims believe that female circumcision makes them more attracted to their potential partners and protects them from the worst, and mothers fear that their daughters will not be married if they are not circumcised, according to the report of the Campaign to Stop Female Circumcision in the Middle East, which was published in 2013 to raise awareness of circumcision and to tell the world that circumcision is not only in Africa but also in many other countries of the Middle East and Asia.
705	The organization lobbies for more data on FGM and has created a survey toolkit to help individuals and groups create small-scale surveys on FGM.	Taasisi hii inaendelea kukusanya taarifa zaidi za ukeketaji na imetengeneza njia ya kukusanya taarifa itakayosaidia mtu mmoja mmoja au vikundi vya watu kufanya tafiti ndogo juu ya ukeketaji.	This organization is continuing to collect more information about rape and has developed a collection method that will help individuals or groups of people conduct small research on rape.
706	Unless there is a critical incident that makes headlines, such as the recent FGM-related death of a 12-year-old girl in southern Egypt in February, people tend to avoid the topic.	Watu hupendelea kuepuka mazungumzo na  mada za ukeketaji labda tu litokee tukio litakalogusa vichwa vya habari kama tukio la kifo cha binti wa miaka 12 alifariki baada ya kukeketwa huko Kusini mwa Misri mwezi Februari, ndipo watu huzungumza.	People tend to avoid talking about rape topics unless a serious event occurs, like the death of a 12-year-old girl who was raped in southern Egypt in February, which makes people talk.
707	Ghida Hussein, an Egyptian student researching FGM, told Global Voices:	Ghida Hussein, mwanafunzi wa Kimisri aliiambia Global Voices kwamba:	Ghida Hussein, a Syria student, told Global Voices that:
708	As we dont talk about it, it is as if the problem doesnt exist.	Kwa kuwa hatuzungumzi kuhusu jambo hili, ni kama vile tatizo hili halipo kabisa.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.

710	It is happening far from the more educated urban centers of power where activists and politicians are seated.	Inatokea huko mbali na watu walioelimika mijini ambapo ndipo wanaharakati na wanasiasa wanakaa.	It happens further away from the citizens of the cities where the activists and politicians live.
711	FGM is a controversial sensitive issue and unless there is international attention and funding, it is not seen locally as a priority by an overwhelming male political class.	Ukeketaji ni jambo tata na labda  jumuiya ya kimataifa zitoe msaada wa fedha na uhamasishaji, lah sivyo hutaona jamii inayotawaliwa na tabaka la wanaume  wakilipa jambo hili kipaumbele.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
712	Breaking the taboo and speaking out about FGM can expose human rights defenders and victims to hate speech and backlash.

713	In Oman, Women's rights activist Habiba al Hinai, founder of the Omani Association for Human Rights (OAHR), conducted a survey in Oman in 2017 and found that 78 percent of women have been cut.

716	I was attacked by religious conservatives who say female circumcision is a form of Islamic worship.	Nimeshambuliwa na waafidhina wa kidini ambao walisema kuwa ukeketaji ni sehemu ya ibada ya Waislam.	I was attacked by religious fundamentalists who said that prayer was part of Islam's faith.
717	In Oman, where FGM is not officially recognized, there is no protection or support for victims.	Huko Omani, ambapo ukeketaji hautambuliki rasmi, hakuna ulinzi kwa wahanga.	In Germany, where genocide is not officially recognized, there is no protection for victims.

The wife of Dadiyata, Kadija, in a BBC interview remembered that her husband was talking on the phone while his car was still moving when the assailants took him.
747	Although Kadija could not hear what ensued over the phone or who he was talking to, she recalled that her husband's abductors had followed him, they even came into the house.	Ingawa Kadija hakuweza kusikia kilichokuwa kinazungumzwa au ni nani alikuwa anaongea naye kwenye simu, anakumbuka watekaji wa mume wake walikuwa wanamfuatilia na walikuja hadi nyumbani.

749	Sadly, theres still no information about Dadiyatas whereabouts.	Mbaya zaidi, ni kwamba hamna taarifa kuhusu alipo Dadiyata.	The worst is that you don't know where Dadiyata is.
750	It is painful, Kadija told the BBC, as their children keep asking about their missing father.	Inaumiza, sana jinsi watoto wao wanavyoendelea kumuulizia baba yao aliyepotea, Kadija aliiambia BBC.	It's really sad, very sad that the children of the missing father are still asking for his father, Kadyja told the BBC.
751	Rather than finding Dadiyata, Nigerian security agencies are absolving themselves from any form of guilt or blame for his disappearance.	Kuliko kumtafuta Dadiyata, taasisi za ulinzi za Nigeria zimeendelea kujitoa kwenye lawama za aina yoyote zinazohusiana na kupotea kwake.	While searching for Dadiyata, Nigerian security agencies have continued to withdraw from any responsibility related to her disappearance.
752	Nigerias Department of State Security (DSS) had in January denied having Dadiyata in their custody.	Idara ya Ulinzi wa Taifa la Naijeria, mpaka Januari iliendelea kukataa kumweka Dadiyata kizuizini.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
753	The state security agency stated that since Dadiyata was taken away from his house by some armed men does not suggest that those men were DSS staff.	Idara ya Ulinzi wa Taifa inasema kwamba kwa kuwa Dadiyata alichukuliwa nyumbani kwake na watu wenye silaha haimaanishi kwamba watu hao ni wafanyakazi wa Idara ya Usalama wa Taifa.

754	Similarly, Aisha Dikko, the attorney general of Kaduna State, denied knowing the whereabouts or of being involved whatsoever in Dadiyatas abduction.	Vilevile mwanasheria mkuu wa Jimbo la Kaduna, Aisha Dikko, alikataa kufahamu alipo au kuhusika na lolote katika utekaji wa Dadiyata.	The chief justice of Kaduna District, Aisha Dikko, also refused to know where Dadiyata was or to be involved in any of the kidnappings.
755	Anything to the contrary is a vile assertion that seeks to stretch the fact that he was abducted within Kaduna State to mean the involvement of the state government, said Dikko.	Kwa vyovyote ni kinyume na ni mtazamo finyu kutaka kuamini kwamba kwa kuwa alitekwa akiwa katika jimbo la Kaduna basi serikali ya jimbo inahusika, alisema Dikko.	If you can't translate it, just say you don't know.
756	However, these denials by DSS and Kaduna State Government neither mitigates the agony of Dadiyatas wife and their two children  nor does it restore his liberty.	Hata hivyo, kukana kuhusika kwa Usalama wa Taifa na serikali ya jimbo la Kaduna hakuondoi sononeko la mke wa  Dadiyata na watoto wao wawili wala hairejeshi uhuru wake.	But the denial of the involvement of the National Security Agency and the Kaduna state government has not eased the sadness of Dadiyata's wife and two children, nor has it restored his freedom.
757	The plea for Dadiyatas release still echoes on Twitter in this hashtag #OneYearWithOutDadiyata, as Nigerians demand his release.

768	One question, how can Dadiyata and his car disappear without trace for a year in Nigeria and the government be just so nonchalant about it, seeking exculpation rather than taking full responsibility for finding him, especially when they were a target of his criticism?	Swali moja ninalojiuliza ni jinsi gani Dadiyata na gari lake walivyopotea bila kuacha alama kwa mwaka mzima tena ndani ya Naijeria; na wala serikali haina wasiwasi juu ya jambo hilo, zaidi inatafuta kujiosha badala ya kuchukua wajibu wa kumtafuta kwa kuwa alikuwa mlengwa kwao kwa sababu ya ukosoaji wake?	One question I wonder is how Dadiyata and his car have gone missing without a trace for a year in Nigeria; and the government is not concerned about this, but simply tries to hide itself from the public, because he was targeted for his criticism.
769	Unfortunately, it seems as if nobody cares about finding the critic.	Bahati mbaya ni kama vile hakuna mtu anayejali kumtafuta mkosoaji huyo:	The worst thing is that no one cares to find the critic.

Askofu alichagua kufanya tukio la kiutamaduni katika moja ya makanisa ya Kikatoliki tarehe 22 Aprili 2019, ikiwa ni siku moja tu baada  shambulio la Kigaidi huko Sri Lanka.	The bishop chose to hold a cultural event in one of the Catholic churches on April 22, 2019, just one day after the attacks in Sri Lanka.
824	Swapon felt the Bishop should have postponed the festivities out of respect for hundreds of people killed in the attacks.	Swapon alidhani kuwa Askofu angeahirisha tamasha hilo kwa kuheshimu maisha ya mamia ya watu yaliyopotea katika shambulio hilo.	Swapon believed that the bishop would end the festival to honor the lives of the thousands of people who died in the attack.
825	Other Christians were angry about the tone he took with the Bishop and some even sent him death threats.	Wakristo wengine walikasirikia lugha aliyoitumia kwa Askofu na wengine walimtumia hata vitisho vya kumuua.	Some Christians were angry with the language he used to the pastor and some even threatened to kill him.
826	Swapon has been vocal in social media against all the injustices and corruption in his town.	Swapon amekuwa mzungumzaji sana mitandaoni akikemea kila aina ya uonevu na rushwa katika mji wao.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.

828	In Bangladesh, the tactics of attacking activists with the allegation of hurting religious sentiments had been a monopoly of the Muslim fundamentalists.	Ndani ya Bangladesh, mkakati wa kushambulia wanaharakati kwa kuwatuhumu kuumiza hisia za kiimani umekuwa ni wa kawaida kwa viongozi wa Kiislamu.	In Bangladesh, the tactic of attacking activists for their alleged religious prejudice has become a common practice for Islamist leaders.
829	Now we see that conservative Christians are also at it.	Sasa tunaona hata wale wa  Wakristo wasiobadilika nao wameanza kutumia mbinu hii.	Now we see that even the unchanged Christians are beginning to use this method.
830	I think those who feel this way hearing criticism are mentally sick.	Nafikiria ambao wanachukia namna hii ya ukosoaji ni wagonjwa wa akili.	I think those who hate this kind of criticism are mentally ill.

Mahmood  alichangia maoni yake wakati wa  machafuko ya kikabila yaliyotokea baada ya mwendesha pikipiki wa  Bengali kuuwawa huko Khagrachhari, yakisababisha kikundi cha wa-Bengali kutia moto nyumba kadhaa na maduka ya wakazi wa eneo la Rangamati ndani ya Chittagong.	Mahmood contributed during the ethnic riots that followed the killing of a Bengali motorcycle racer in Khagrachhari, which led to the Bengali group burning down houses and shops of the Rangamati residents in Chittagong.
837	Local sources told the Dhaka Tribune that police had taken no measures to control the situation.	Vyanzo vya huko viliiambia Dhaka Tribune kuwa polisi hawakuchukua hatua zozote kuzuia jambo hilo.	Sources in the area told the Dhaka Tribune that police did not take any action to prevent this.

862	Despite concerns about its implications for freedom of expression, the Bangladeshi parliament approved the Digital Security Act in September 2018.	Pamoja na kuonesha kuwa sheria hiyo ingebana uhuru wa kujieleza, bunge la Bangladeshi  iliipitisha sheria ya Usalama wa Mitandaoni hapo Septemba 2018.	Although it was reported that the law would restrict freedom of speech, Bangladeshi parliament passed the Internet Security Act in September 2018.
863	The law replaced the notorious Information and  Technology Act, which had also been used as a tool for silencing critical speech online.	Sheria hii ilichukua nafasi ya sheria nyingine kandamizi ya Habari na Teknolijia, ambayo pia ilikuwa ilitumika kama chombo cha  kuwanyamazisha wakosoaji Mitandaoni.

Sheria hii inahukumu baadhi ya mazungumzo mitandaoni kuanzia jumbe za kubeza mpaka  mazungumzo yenye kuumiza hisia na maadili ya  kidini ikiorodhesha pia faini kubwa.	This law covers some online conversations from insults to religious abuse and includes a huge fine.
865	It also authorizes lengthy prison sentences for using the internet to create public unrest, and for gathering, sending or preserving classified government documents using a digital device.	Pia inaruhusu vifungo vya muda mrefu kwa makosa ya  kutumia mitandao kusababisha vurugu katika jamii na kwa kukusanya, kutuma na kuhifadhi habari na nyaraka nyeti za serikali kupitia huduma za kidigitali.	It also allows for long-term suspensions for illegal use of the Internet to cause violence in the community and for collecting, sending and storing government information and sensitive documents through digital services.
866	The Editors Council of Bangladesh said that the Act is against the freedom guaranteed by the constitution, media freedom and freedom of speech.	Baraza la Wahariri la Bangladeshi lilisema kuwa sheria hii ni kinyume na uhuru uliotolewa kikatiba, uhuru wa vyombo vya habari na uhuru wa kujieleza.	The Bangladeshi Press Council said that the law was against the constitutional freedoms of speech, press freedom and freedom of speech.

Wananchi wa Sudani wamegawanyika katika makundi mawili katika suala hili: kundi la kwanza linaona kuwa kutenga uraia na dini ni jambo la msingi katika misingi haki za Binadamu; kundi la pili linaona kuwa serikali ya mpito haina mamlaka ya kufanya maamuzi juu ya jambo hilo bila ruhusa ya wananchi kupitia uchaguzi wa kidemokrasia.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The Sudanese are divided into two groups in this issue: the first group believes that separating citizenship and religion is fundamental to human rights; the second group believes that the transition government has no power to decide on this issue without the consent of the people through democratic elections.
906	Following the meeting, the prime ministers Twitter account published an Arabic version of the agreement that differed from the English one, addressed as a joint press release.

After the meeting, the Prime Minister's Twitter account published a copy of the agreement in Arabic which was different from the English version.
907	While the English document emphasized the separation of religion from the state as an inevitability, the Arabic document only recommended discussion of the controversial issue.	Wakati katika nakala ya Kiingereza msisitizo umewekwa kwa kuonesha kuwa haiwezekani kutenganisha dini na utaifa, katika nakala ya lugha ya Kiarabu inapendekeza majadiliano katika suala hili lenye utata.

995	So far, none of those boycotts seem to have translated into action on the side of government.	Hata hivyo, hakuna mgomo wowowte kati ya hii ambao umechukuliwa hatua na serikali.	But, no one of these strikes has been taken into account by the government.
996	Ultimately, voters are adopting such tactics as a show of frustration towards officials and politicians who often reach out to neglected communities only before elections, in hope of securing their votes, but fail to deliver once the elections are over.	Wapiga kura wengi wameanza kuzoea kutumia mbinu hii kama ishara ya kuonesha hasira zao kwa wanasiasa na maofisa wa serikali ambao huzigeukia jamii walizozitelekeza katika kipindi cha uchaguzi wakiwa ma matumaini ya kupata kura zao, huku wakishindwa kutekeleza ahadi zao baada ya uchaguzi.	Many voters have become accustomed to using this method as a way to show their anger at politicians and government officials who often turn to their communities with hopes of winning their vote, but fail to fulfill their promises after the election.
997	In the end, if boycotting elections does not heed changes in society, what else can members of neglected communities do to get the attention of those supposed to hear them and take proper action?	Lakini mwishowe, kama Kugomea chaguzi haitaleta mabadiliko katika jamii, je ni kitu gani wanajamii wataamua kufanya ili kuvuta masikio ya wenye mamlaka ambao wanapaswa kusikia sauti zao na kuchukua hatua za utekelezaji?	But finally, if refusing to vote doesn't bring about a change in the society, what will the citizens decide to do to lure the authorities who should hear their voices and take action?

Kilichotokea kwa waandishi hawa wa habari ni sehemu ya muendelezo  wa unyanyaswaji dhidi ya wafanyakazi wa vyombo vya habari Kaskazini mwa Msumbiji.	The incident with these journalists is part of a series of attacks on journalists in northern Mozambique.

Ukweli ni kwamba amevumilia kuwa kizuizini bila kushtakiwa kwa siku 106 kabla ya dhamana,  sio uungwana aliotendewa.

1057	When it comes to Iran, I often find myself having to go all the way back to 1979, then explaining the transformations that took place decade-by-decade, just to make sense of the present.

1059	This explains why its vital to cover Iran from the bottom up, chronicling the lives of ordinary people.	Hii inaonesha jinsi ilivyo muhimu kuifunika Irani gubigubi, tukiyaweka katika mtiririko maalum maisha ya watu wa kawaida.	This shows how important it is to cover Iran tightly, keeping the ordinary life in a special flow.
1060	Covering a country by reporting on the pronouncements of the ruling elite is probably the least interesting or informative kind of journalism.	Tukiifikia nchini kwa kutoa taarifa za wasomi ma wenye mamlaka pekee hilo sio jambo la msingi au muhimu sana kwetu kama wanahabari.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1061	Thats why even very sophisticated people who follow the news on Iran have no idea what goes on there.	Ndio maana hata watu makini sana wanaofuatilia habari hawaelewi mambo ya msingi yanayotokea nchini Irani.	That's why even the most serious observers of news don't understand the fundamental issues in Iran.

1230	According to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), linguistic and cultural diversity are of strategic importance for people around the world to strengthen the unity and cohesion of societies.	Kulingana na shirika la Umoja wa Mataifa la Elimu, Sayansi na Utamaduni (UNESCO), utofauti wa lugha na utamaduni una umuhimu kimkakati kwa watu ulimwenguni kote katika juhudi za kuimarisha umoja na mshikamano wa jamii.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1231	This linguistic and cultural diversity propelled the UNESCO general conference to proclaim International Mother Language Day (IMLD) in November 1999, to be commemorated annually on February 21 annually.	Utofauti huu wa lugha na utamaduni ulishinikiza kongamano kuu la UNESCO kutangaza Siku ya Kimataifa ya Lugha ya Mama (IMLD) mnamo Novemba 1999, siku inayokumbukuwa mnamo Februari 21 kila mwaka.	This difference in language and culture led to UNESCO's chief conference to declare the International Mother Language Day (IMLD) in November 1999, a day which is observed on February 21 every year.
1232	To bolster IMLD, the United Nations (UN) declared the International Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL 2019), to draw attention to the endangerment of the worlds indigenous languages.	Kuimarisha IMLD, Umoja wa Mataifa (UN) ulitangaza Mwaka wa Kimataifa wa Lugha za Asili (IYIL 2019), ili kuzingatia hatari ya kuangamia kwa lugha za asili ulimwenguni.	Strengthening the IMLD, the United Nations (UN) has announced the International Year of Languages (IYIL 2019), to examine the danger of global decline of native languages.
1233	Today, there are over 7,100 languages spoken around the world, 28 percent of which are spoken on the African continent alone.	Hivi leo, kuna zaidi ya lugha 7,100 zinazozungumzwa kote duniani,asilimia 28 yazo zikizungumzwa barani Afrika pekee.	Today, there are over 7,100 languages spoken around the world, 28 percent of which are spoken in Africa.
1234	Despite this, English dominates online spaces in the region.	Licha ya hili, Kiingereza kinaongoza mtandaoni katika eneo hili.	However, English is the dominant language on the Internet. If you cannot translate it simply say you don't know.
1235	Some twenty years ago, 80 percent of the worlds online content was English-centric.	Miaka ishirini iliyopita, asilimia 80 ya maudhui ya dunia mtandaoni yalikuwa yanaegemea Kiingereza.	In the last 20 years, 80% of the world's online content was based on English.
1236	Currently, however, English content online is said to have shrunk to between 51- 55 percent.	Kwa sasa, hata hivyo, maudhui ya Kiingereza yanasemekana kupungua hadi kiwango cha kati ya asilimia 51 hadi 55.	But, at the moment, English content is reported to have fallen to a level between 51. and 55.
1237	The million-dollar question, therefore, is: Could this sharp drop be an indicator that people now favor their native languages online over English, considering that less than 15 percent of the world population speaks English as their first language?	Swala kizushi, kwa hivyo, ni:je, kupungua huku kunaashiria kuwa sasa watu wanapendelea lugha zao za asilia kuliko Kiingereza, ukizingatia kuwa ni chini ya asilimia 15 tu ya idadi ya watu duniani inayozungumza Kiingereza kama lugha yao ya kwanza?	The question is, therefore, whether this decline indicates that people are now preferred to speak their native languages over English, given that only 15 percent of the world's population speaks English as their first language?

1249	Despite Swahili being the most widely spoken African language, with approximately 150 million speakers  mostly in East Africa, the Great Lakes region, southern Somalia, and some parts of Southern Africa, its visibility online is dismal.	Licha ya kuwa lugha ya Kiafrika inayozungumzwa sana, na takribani watu milioni 150  haswa katika Afrika Mashariki, kanda ya maziwa makuu, kusini mwa Somalia, na maeneo mengine ya kusini mwa Afrika, muonekano wa Kiswahili mtandaoni ni finyu.	Although Kiswahili is an African language spoken by about 150 million people, mostly in the East African, the Sahara, the south of Somalia, and other south African areas, its presence on the Internet is limited.
1250	John Walubengo, a lecturer at the Multimedia University of Kenya, states in an op-ed with the Nation, a Kenyan daily, that the absence of online linguistic and cultural diversity creates a society with a tunnel-vision view of the world.	John Walubengo, mhadhiri wa Chuo Kikuu cha Multimedia cha Kenya, anachanganua kwenye makala yake katika Nation, jarida la kila siku nchini Kenya, kuwa ukosefu wa lugha na utamaduni mtandaoni unaunda jamii yenye mtazamo mdogo wa dunia.

1251	Walubengo predicts that most indigenous cultures end up surrendering their identities to the English way of doing things.	Walubengo anaelezea kuwa tamaduni nyingi za kiasili huishia kusalimisha utambulisho wao kwa hali za Kiingereza za ufanyaji mambo.	Walbengo explains that many native cultures tend to subordinate their identity to English ways of doing things.
1252	This sad reality can only be reversed if indigenous civilizations fight to retain their identities both online and offline, he says.	Ukweli huu wa kusikitisha hata hivyo unaweza kubadilishwa tu iwapo jamii asilia zitapigania kuhifadhi utambulisho wao mtandaoni na vile vile nje ya mtandao, anasema.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know This tragic fact can only be changed if native groups fight to preserve their identity online and offline, he says.

If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1277	Therefore, a lack of sufficient local content could have adverse effects as far as digital inclusion.	Kwa hivyo, ukosekanaji wa maudhui asilia huenda ukawa na athari kubwa mno  ukizingatia ujumuishwaji kidijitali.	So, the lack of original material may have a significant impact on digital interpretation.
1278	This will outrightly affect digital rights  largely, internet access, right to access information online, and the right to use their own indigenous language to create, share and disseminate information and knowledge through the internet.	Bayana, huku kutaathiri haki za kidijitali  haswa, ufikiaji mtandao, haki ya kufikia maelezo mtandaoni, na haki ya kutumia lugha zao asilia kutengeneza, kushiriki, na kusambaza taarifa na maarifa kupitia mtandao.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1279	It is thus vital to put in place formidable action plans that will foster the development of ICT applications and services, as well as the use of local languages, to guarantee digital inclusion for all.	Hivyo ni muhimu kuweka mikakati itakayoendeleza utengenezaji wa programu za TEHAMA na huduma, vile vile utumiaji wa lugha asilia, ili kuhakikisha ujumuishwaji wa kidijitali kwa wote.	So it is important to set goals that will promote the development of e-commerce and services, as well as the use of native language, to ensure digital literacy for all.
1280	This, complemented by actions such as localization of digital training and learning materials, and rural ICT literacy programs, is likely to spur a digital revolution, hence promoting digital rights of internet users and bridging the digital divide.	Hatua hii, ikihimiliwa na juhudi zenginezo kama vile ujanibishaji wa vifaa vya kufunzia na kujifunzia, na mipango ya kusoma na kuandika ya TEHAMA vijijini, inaweza kuchochea mapinduzi ya kidijitali, na hivyo basi kukuza haki za kidijitali za watumizi wa mtandao na kuziba pengo la mgawanyiko wa kidijitali.	If you cannot translate this sentence simply say you don't know This step, supported by other initiatives such as integrated educational and learning tools, and rural e-learning programs, can encourage digital transformation, thus promoting digital rights of users of the Internet and covering the gap between digital communities.

1339	In the early morning of November 15, 2017, Zimbabweans woke up to the news that former strongman, the late Robert Mugabe, had been deposed in a coup d'etat, and was under house arrest with his family at the presidential residence, State House.	Mapema asubuhi ya Novemba 15, 2017, raia wa Zimbabwe waliamka na habari zilizoenea kwamba aliyekuwa mbabe, marehemu Robert Mugabe, alikuwa amengolewa madarakani katika mapinduzi ya serikali, na alikuwa nguvuni kwenye makazi yake, Ikulu, pamoja na familia yake.	If you can't translate, just say you don't know On November 15, 2017, Zimbabweans woke up with reports that the ex-leader, Robert Mugabe, had been removed from power in a government coup, and was locked up in his residence, the palace, and his family.
1340	Major General Sibusiso Moyo, now foreign affairs minister, announced on state television that the president was safe under state custody and that the situation has moved to another level.	Meja Jenerali Sibusiso Moyo, ambaye kwa sasa ni waziri wa mambo ya nje, alitangaza kwenye runinga ya taifa kuwa rais huyo alikuwa salama chini ya ulinzi wa serikali na kwamba hali ya mambo iko katika ngazi nyingine.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1341	Almost immediately following General Moyos announcement, Zimbabweans fervently took to social media  in particular, WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook  to get updates on the situation.	Mara tu baada ya tangazo hilo la Jenerali Moyo, raia wa Zimbabwe walimiminika kwa msisimko mkubwa kwenye mitandao ya kijamii  hasa WhatsApp, Twitter na Facebook  ili kupata taarifa mpya kuhusu hali hiyo.	Just after the announcement of General Moyo, Zimbabweans flooded social media, including WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook, to get a new update on the situation.
1342	This newfound popularity of social media to access information and mobilise protests took root for the first time among Zimbabweans, when protesters took to the streets and helped push Mugabe out of office.	Kwa mara ya kwanza, umaarufu mpya wa mitandao ya kijamii kuwezesha kupata habari na kuhamasisha maandamano ulimea mizizi miongoni mwa raia wa Zimbabwe, wakati waandamanaji walipoingia mitaani na kusaidia kushinikiza kuondolewa kwa Mugabe madarakani.	For the first time, the new popularity of social media to enable access to information and encourage protests spread among Zimbabwean citizens, when protesters entered the streets and helped to encourage Mugabe's resignation.
1343	The new government, led by Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, took notice of social medias power.	Serikali mpya, iliyoongozwa na Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa,ilingamua mara nguvu ya  mitandao ya kijamii.	Return only if you cannot translate. If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1344	As a former state security minister, Mnangagwa also appreciated the importance and value of disinformation in Zimbabwes political terrain.	Kama waziri wa zamani wa usalama wa nchi, Mnangagwa pia alitambua umuhimu na nafasi ya  upotoshaji taarifa katika nyanja za kisiasa za Zimbabwe.	As a former national security minister, Mnangagwa also recognized the importance and role of lying in Zimbabwean politics.
1345	In a calculated move to consolidate newfound political power and ensure an electoral victory during the presidential and legislative elections scheduled for next year, Mnangagwa instructed his ruling ZANU PF (Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front) party youth league to enter the social media and online firmament and batter the opponent, back in March 2018.	Mnamo mwezi Machi, 2018, kwa kutambua mara na ili kujitwalia mamlaka ya kisiasa yaliyojianika mbele yake na ili kuhakikisha ushindi katika uchaguzi wa rais na wabunge katika mwaka uliofuatia, Mnangagwa aliamuru umoja wa vijana wa chama tawala cha  ZANU PF (Zimbabwe National Union-Patriotic Front) kujimwaga katika mitandao ya kijamii na mtandaoni na kuwachafua na kuwashambulia wapinzani.	In March 2018, to recognize and to secure the political powers which were established before him and to ensure a victory in the next election and parliament, Mnangagwa ordered the ZANU PF (Zimbabwe National Union-Patriotic Front) youth movement to spread across social media and online to denigrate and attack opponents.
1346	In post-Mugabe Zimbabwe, this has exacerbated a mis- and disinformation crisis, leaving Zimbabweans with few credible and accurate sources of information to stay informed about the countrys transition and and anti-government protests.	Katika Zimbabwe baada ya Mugabe, mpango wake huu umeimarisha mgogoro wa upotoshaji na utoaji taarifa zisizo za kweli, na hivyo kuwaacha Wazimbabwe na vyanzo vichache tu vya kuaminika vya kupata habari na kujua kuhusu yanayoendelea katika kipindi cha mpito na maandamano ya kupinga serikali.	If you can't translate this, just say you don't know In Zimbabwe after Mugabe, this plan has created a crisis of lying and false reports, leaving Zimbabweans with few reliable sources of information and knowledge about what is happening in the transition period and protests against the government.
1347	While the new government decried fake news pertaining to any news circulated on social media that they perceived to threaten the countrys status quo, it also deployed tactics aimed at misleading the public about its handling of anti-government protests.	Wakati ambapo serikali mpya ilijidai kulaani habari za uongo  kwa taarifa zilizosambazwa kwenye mitandao ya kijamii na ambazo waliziona kuwa tishio utawala ulio madarakani,  pia ilifanya hila ilikuupotosha umma kuhusu namna ilivyoshughulika na maandamano ya kuipinga serikali.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1348	The bane of online free expression	Kero ya uhuru wa kujieleza mtandaoni	The freedom of expression on the internet.
1349	Zimbabwe has witnessed a significant rise in mobile internet and social media usage over the past few years.	Zimbabwe imeshuhudia ongezeko kubwa la matumizi ya intaneti kwenye simu za mkononi na mitandao ya kijamii katika miaka michache iliyopita.	Return to the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1350	The internet penetration rate increased by 41.1 percent, from 11 percent of the population to 52.1 percent between 2010 and 2018, while mobile phone penetration increased by 43.8 percent from 58.8 percent to 102.7 percent over the same period.	Kiwango cha kuenea kwa intaneti kiliongezeka kwa asilimia 41.1, kutoka asilimia 11 ya idadi ya watu hadi asilimia 52.1 kati ya 2010 na 2018, wakati kuenea kwa simu za mkononi kuliongezeka kwa asilimia 43.8 kutoka asilimia 58.8 hadi asilimia 102.7 kwa kipindi hicho hicho.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The percentage of Internet usage has increased by 41.1 percent from 11% to 52.1 percent between 2010 and 2018, while the percentage of mobile phone usage has increased by 43.8 percent from 58.8 to 102.7 percent during the same period.
1351	This means that half the population is now connected to the internet, compared to only 11 percent in 2010.	Hii inamaanisha kuwa nusu ya idadi ya watu sasa imeunganishwa na intaneti, ikilinganishwa na asilimia 11 tu katika mwaka 2010.	This means that half of the population is now connected to the Internet, compared with only 11 percent in 2010.
1352	However, mis- and disinformation have found fertile ground to flourish owing to a variety of factors: extreme polarisation in the media, proposed government controls over social media, poor official communication methods and low digital literacy among internet users.	Hata hivyo, upotoshaji na utoaji taarifa za uongo nao vimepata mazingira ya kushamiri kwa sababu kadhaa: mgawanyiko mkubwa katika vyombo vya habari, mapendekezo ya serikali kudhibiti mitandao ya kijamii, njia hafifu za mawasiliano rasmi na na elimu duni miongoni mwa watumiaji wa intaneti.	But, lying and falsehood have also become a growing problem due to several reasons: widespread divisions in the media, government proposals to control social media, weak communications channels and poor education among Internet users.
1353	During the anti-government protests of January 2019, when state security forces arrested and beat hundreds of protesters, news of these clampdowns competed with government claims of fake news or their absolute denial.	Wakati wa maandamano dhidi ya serikali ya Januari 2019, kipindi vikosi vya usalama vya serikali vilipowakamata na kuwashambulia mamia ya waandamanaji, habari za ukandamizaji huu zilishindana na madai ya serikali kwamba zilikuwa habari za uongo au pale ilipokanusha kabisa kuwepo kwake.	When the government took over the protests in January 2019, when the government took over the protests and killed hundreds of protesters, the reports of this violence clashed with government claims that they were false or when it completely denied its existence.
1354	The government restricted access to internet services to disrupt the flow of information and contribute to widespread confusion.	Serikali ilizuia upatikanaji wa huduma za intaneti ili kuvuruga mtiririko wa habari na hivyo kuleta mkanganyiko mkubwa.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know. The government blocked access to Internet services to block the flow of information and thus causing a great confusion.
1355	They and their supporters also resorted to public misinformation about the protests and discredited any truthful information or reports as fake news.	Viongozi wa serikali na wafuasi wao pia walitumia mbinu ya kupotosha taarifa kuhusu maandamano hayo na kupenyeza mashaka katika taarifa zozote zilizokuwa za weli kwa kuzipachika jina la habari za uongo.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1356	In Zimbabwe, citizens usually regard general statements issued by government ministers as official policy.	Kwa kawaida, nchini Zimbabwe,  raia huzichukulia taarifa zozote zitolewazo na mawaziri wa serikali kama ndio sahihi.	In Zimbabwe, citizens usually take any information provided by government ministers as correct.
1357	For example, Deputy Information Minister Energy Mutodi sought to convince people that everything was normal and that videos and images of the military patrolling the streets were the work of a few rogue individuals.	Kwa mfano, Naibu Waziri wa Habari Energy Mutodi alijitokeza kuwashawishi watu kuwa kila kitu kilikuwa shwari na kwamba video na picha za wanajeshi waliokuwa wakipiga doria mitaani zilitengenezwa na wahuni wachache.	For example, Energy Mutodi, the Deputy Minister of Information, came out to persuade people that everything was okay and that the video and pictures of the soldiers taking patrols in the streets were made by a few bandits.
1358	Mutodi further misled the nation when he claimed on state television that there was no internet shutdown but rather a congested network.	Mutodi alizidi kupotosha taifa pale alipodai kwenye runinga ya taifa kwamba hakukuwepo na uzimwaji wa intaneti bali kulikuwa na msongamano katika mtandao.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1359	In another suspected case of possible government-sanctioned disinformation, millions of people remained cut off from social media during the January protests.	Katika kisa kingine kinachoshukiwa kuwa ni upotoshaji habari unaoungwa mkono na serikali, mamilioni wa watu walizimiwa mitandao ya kijamii wakati wa maandamano ya Januari.	In a further case suspected of being a government-backed rumor, millions of people were blocked on social media during the January protests.
1360	Others downloaded Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications to stay informed, but messages circulated that downloading such applications would lead to arrests, creating further panic and apprehension.	Wengine walipakua zana za  huduma ya kubaki hewani kwa ushirika inayojulikana kama Virtual Private Network (VPN) ili kuendelea kuhabarika, hata hivyo taarifa ilisambazwa kwamba kupakua zana kama hizo kungesababisha kukamatwa, hali iliyozidi kusababisha hofu na taharuki.	Some installed a VPN service to stay up-to-date, but a warning was spread that downloading such tools could result in arrest, which further created fear and panic.
1361	When in March 2019, Human Rights Watch (HRW) tweeted a report denouncing the governments use of horrific violence during the January 2019 protests, government supporters took to Twitter to discredit and attack HRW.	Mwezi Machi 2019, wakati Shirika la Haki za Kibinadamu (HRW) lilichapisha kwa twiti ripoti iliyolaani matumizi ya ukatili wa kutisha wa serikali kudhibiti maandamano ya Januari 2019, wafuasi wa serikali walitumia Twita kulichafua na kulishambulia shirika hilo la HRW.

1395	During both shutdowns in 2016, the Ugandan government cited national security as the motivation behind restrictions.	Wakati wa matukio yote ya ufungwaji mwaka 2016, serikali ya Uganda ilitaja kuwa sababu ilikuwa ni usalama wa kitaifa ili kudhibiti mtandao.	When all the attacks of 2016 took place, the government of Uganda announced that the reason was national security to control the network.
1396	The disruptions were ordered by Ugandas security agencies and the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC), which regulates the telecommunications sector, online publications, broadcasting (both radio and television), film industry, postal and courier services.	Uvurugwaji uliagizwa na vyombo vya usalama vya Uganda na Tume ya Mawasiliano ya Uganda (UCC), ambayo inasimamia sekta ya mawasiliano, machapisho ya mtandaoni, utangazaji (wote redio na runinga), tasnia ya filamu, huduma za posta, usambazaji barua na vifurushi.

1399	The same day, President Museveni told journalists that he ordered the blocking of social media: Steps must be taken for security to stop so many getting in trouble, it is temporary because some people use those pathways for telling lies, he said.	Siku hiyo hiyo, Rais Museveni aliwaambia waandishi wa habari kwamba aliamuru kufungwa kwa mitandao ya kijamii: Hatua lazima zichukuliwe kwa ajili ya usalama kuzuia watu wengi kujiingiza kwenye taabu, ni kwa muda mfupi kwa sababu watu wengine hutumia njia hizo kusema uongo, alisema.	"The same day, President Museveni told journalists that he had ordered the closure of social media: ""The measures must be taken to protect the safety of many people, it is for a short time because some people use these means to tell lies,"" he said."
1400	On March 17, in an official declaration during Supreme Court deliberations in which President Musevenis 2016 victory was challenged, the UCC executive director Godfrey Mutabazi explained that he received instructions from the Inspector General of Police, Kale Kayihura, to shut down social media networking sites and mobile money facilities owing to security concerns.	Mnamo Machi 17, katika tamko rasmi wakati wa maamuzi ya Mahakama Kuu ambako ushindi wa Rais Museveni ulipingwa, mkurugenzi mtendaji wa UCC, Godfrey Mutabazi alielezea kwamba alipokea maagizo kutoka kwa Inspekta Jenerali wa Polisi, Kale Kayihura, kufunga tovuti za mitandao ya kijamii na huduma za kutuma pesa kwa njia ya simu kwa sababu za kiusalama.	In a statement during the Supreme Court ruling which rejected President Museveni's election, UCC director Godfrey Mutabazi explained that he received a command from the Chief Inspector General of Police, Kale Kayihura, to close social media sites and mobile money services for security reasons.
1401	These shutdowns interfered with the rights and daily lives of Ugandans who use the internet and social media platforms to access information, express views and conduct everyday business online.

1404	Even with the social media bans in place, many Ugandans continued to post about the elections using Virtual Private Networks or VPNs.	Licha ya ufungwaji wa mitandao ya kijamii, Waganda wengi waliendelea kutuma taarifa kuhusu uchaguzi kwa kutumia anwani ya mtandao binafsi inayofahamika kama VPN.	Although social media was closed, many Ugandans continued to send reports about the election using a private VPN address.
1405	On election day, citizens were able to share updates on late arrivals of voting materials at various stations, reports of election malpractice, and provisional election results on social media.	Siku ya uchaguzi, raia waliweza kushiriki yaliyokuwa yanajiri kuhusu kucheleweshwa kwa vifaa vya kupiga kura katika vituo mbali mbali, visa vya udanganyifu katika uchaguzi, na matokeo ya muda ya uchanguzi kwenye mitandao ya kijamii.	The day of the election, citizens could participate in the news of the delay in the polling machines at various locations, cases of fraud in the election, and the timetable of the election on social media.
1406	Human rights activists say that targeted shutdowns during election periods slow down communication, just when access to information and citizen expression are most needed.	Wanaharakati wa haki za binadamu wanasema kwamba ufungwaji wa kimkakati wakati wa uchaguzi hupunguza kasi ya mawasiliano, wakati tu upatikanaji wa habari na usemi wa raia unahitajika sana.	Human rights activists say that a campaign shutdown during elections slows down communication, when only access to information and the citizens' voice is needed.
1407	Internet shutdowns limit people from communicating particular concerns that affect them, such as health, interaction with friends as well sharing of political views and opinions, Moses Owiny, the chief executive of the Center for Multilateral Affairs, an independent platform for policy analysis operating in Uganda and Tanzania, told Global Voices in an interview.	Kufungwa kwa mtandao kunazuia watu kuzungumzia mambo fulani yanayowaathiri, kama vile afya, mwingiliano na marafiki na pia kubadilishana maoni ya kisiasa, Moses Owiny, afisa mkuu wa the Center for Multilateral Affairs, jukwaa huru la uchambuzi wa sera linalofanya shughuli nchini Uganda na Tanzania, aliiambia  Global Voices katika mahojiano.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1408	According to Owiny, shutdowns primarily aim to stop dissent in politics based on perceived fear by the state that citizens views and concerns are likely to incite the public, an accusation he believes is unfounded and not grounded in reality but assumptions.	Kwa mujibu wa Owiny, ufungwaji hukusudia kuzuia upinzani katika siasa kwa misingi ya hofu ya serikali kwamba maoni ya raia yanaweza kuchochea umma, madai ambayo anaamini hayana msingi kiuhakika ila ni ya kudhaniwa.	Owiny said that the execution was meant to prevent opposition in politics because the government feared that the citizens' opinion could cause a public outcry, a claim he believed was not based on facts but on myths.

Owiny argues that the government has the power to shut down the Internet whenever it believes it is necessary: When the security of the government and the security of its citizens are in conflict, and when the security of the government is compromised, the security of the government and its recovery will be priority.

The organization pointed out that the government's planned shutdown of the Internet violated the rights of Ugandan citizens to freedom of speech and assembly as defined in Article 29 (1) of the 1995 Constitution.
1438	However, a judge ruled that the applicants failed to prove any violations that resulted from the shutdowns, Unwanted Witness Uganda told Global Voices.	Hata hivyo, jaji alitoa uamuzi kwamba upande wa mashtaka ulishindwa kuthibitisha ukiukwaji wowote uliotokana na ufungwaji huo, Unwanted Witness ililiambia shirika la Global Voices.	But the judge ruled that the prosecution could not prove any violations of the prisoner's privacy, a witness told the Global Voices.

1530	At that time, an Ebola infection was considered a death sentence due to the lack of an effective treatment.	Kwa wakati huo, maambukizi ya Ebola yalichukuliwa kama hukumu ya kifo kutokana na ukosefu wa matibabu yenye tija.	At that time, Ebola infections were considered a death penalty due to lack of effective treatment.
1531	As  Böl asserted, the high mortality rate of Ebola and also the sometimesexaggerated media coverage of the epidemic created hysteria around the world.	Kama Böl alivyotangulia kusema, kasi kubwa ya vifo vinavyotokana na ugonjwa wa Ebola na  na pia /a> wakati mwingine taarifa za upotoshaji kupitia vyombo vya habari kuhusu Ebola zilichangia kuibua hofu duniani kote.	As Böl said, the huge increase in deaths from Ebola and sometimes false reports from media about Ebola have contributed to the spread of fear around the world.
1532	This position was further corroborated by a 2017 study in which Hal Roberts, Brittany Seymour, Sands Alden Fish II, Emily Robinson and Ethan Zuckerman analyzed over 109,000 stories published in US mainstream/regional media and blogs between July to November 2014, with a focus on Ebola coverage.

On September 30, the media reported a detailed report of Thomas Duncan being ill with Ebola in Texas, which was the first time the disease was reported in the United States.
1536	On October 12, Ebola coverage intensified with the first infection of a health care worker in the United States.	Mwezi Oktoba tarehe 12, taarifa za mgonjwa wa Ebola ambaye ni ambaye ni mtoa huduma za afya zilisambamba kwa kina nchini Marekani.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know On October 12, the reports of an Ebola patient who is a health care provider in the United States were mixed.
1537	After October 12, a series of other US infection-related events led to continuous coverage that gradually lessened in intensity over time.	Baada ya tarehe 12 Oktoba,matuko mengine ya mlipo wa Ebola yaliripotiwa mfululizo hali iliyopelekea utipotiwaji wake kufifia siku hadi siku.	After the 12th of October,another cases of Ebola were reported which led to the reduction of its reported cases.
1538	US media may have covered Ebola so intensively because of the presence of the disease in the US.	Kuna uwezekano kuwa vyombo vya habari vya nchini Marekani vimeripoti sana kuhusu ugonjwa wa Ebola kwa sababu ya matukio ya uwepo wa ugonjwa huu nchini humo.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1539	In addition, with a more interconnected army of digital networks, the Ebola epidemic became more amplified in Europe and the US.	Pia, kutokana na urahisi wa upashanaji habari kutpia mitandao ya kijamii, ugonjwa wa Ebola umetokea kujadiliwa sana kwenye vyombo vya habari vya Ulaya na Marekani.	Also, due to the ease of spreading information through social media, the Ebola virus has become a topic of discussion in European and American media.
1540	However, what remains to be seen is if the discovery of a cure by an African from DR of Congo to this African epidemic will also garner as much coverage as it did in 2017.	Hata hivyo, kinachosubiriwa ni kuona ikiwa taarifa za dawa ya kutibu ugonjwa wa Ebola iliyogunduliwa na Mwafrika kutoka Jamhuri ya Kidemokrasia ya Congo inayotibu gonjwa hili la Kiafrika itapewa nafasi kwenye vyombo vya habari kama ilivyokuwa mwaka 2017.	But, what is waiting is to see if the announcement of the Ebola cure developed by a Congolese man who claims to be able to treat the African disease will be given a significant coverage in the media as it was in 2017.

1744	Hungarian pro-government media outlets have launched new attacks against Blanka Nagy, a high school student who has spoken out against the government at several protests since late 2018.	Vyombo vya habari vinavyoiunga serikali ya Hungary mkono vimeanza mashambulizi mapya dhidi ya Blanka Nagy, mwanafunzi wa shule ya upili ambaye alizungumza vibaya dhidi ya serikali katika maandamano kadhaa tangu mwisho mwa mwaka 2018.	The Hungarian media have started a new attack on Blanka Nagy, a schoolgirl who has been speaking against the government in several protests since the end of 2018.
1745	Nagy has endured criticism of her intellect and even sexual harassment, with one outlet calling her a whore.	Nagy anavumilia ukosoaji mwingi dhidi yake na pia amedhalilishwa kijinsia na chanzo kimoja cha habari kimemuita kahaba.	If you cannot translate simply say you don't know.
1746	She has already filed and won defamation cases against three pro-government outlets that claimed she was failing in school: Lokál, Ripost, and Origo.	Tayari ameshafungua kesi ya kudhalilishwa na kushinda kesi dhidi ya vyombo vitatu Lokàl, Ripost na Origo ambayo vinavyoiunga mkono serikali, vilisema kuwa alikuwa akifeli shuleni.	He has already filed a complaint of bullying and won a case against three media organizations, Lokàl, Ripost and Origo, which claimed he was failing school.
1747	However, after Nady won her case against Origo, the outlet launched another attack, publishing her school reports.	Hata hivyo, baada ya Nady kushinda kesi dhidi ya Origo, chanzo hicho kilimshambulia tena kwa kuchapisha ripoti yake ya shule.	But after Nady won the case against Origo, the source again attacked her by publishing her school report.
1748	Nagy told Atlatszo that she is considering suing Origo again over these latest stories.	Nady aliwaambia Atlatszo kuwa alikuwa anafikiria kuwashtaki Origo tena kwa sababu ya habari zao za hivi karibu.	Nady told Atlatszo that she was considering suing Origo again for their recent reports.
1749	Blanka Nagy became well-known in Hungary last winter after she gave a speech at an anti-government rally, in which she criticized prominent politicians using foul language.	Blanka Nagy amekuwa maarufu nchini Hungary katika majira ya baridi yaliyopita baada ya kutoa hotuba katika maandamano ya kuipinga serikali, ambapo alikosoa wanasiasa maarufu, huku akitumia lugha kali.

1750	Her harsh words resonated with many social media users and a video of her speech went viral.	Maneno yake makali yalisambazwa na watumiaji wa mitandao ya kijamii kupitia video ya hotuba yake.	If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1751	About two months after her video became a social media sensation, the pro-government media and pundits such as Zsolt Bayer launched a series of attacks against her.	Miezi miwili baada ya video yake kuvuta hisia katika mitandao ya kijamii, vyombo vinavyoiunga serikali mkono na Wanazuoni kama vile Zsolt Bayer walianzisha mfululizo wa mashambulizi dhidi yake.	After two months of his video being shared on social media, government-backed organizations and academics such as Zsolt Bayer began a series of attacks against him.
1752	Pro-government outlets claimed that she was failing many of her subjects in school and that she had missed many days of school.	Vyombo hivyo vilisema kuwa alikuwa akifeli masomo yake mengi na pia alikuwa amekosa siku nyingi za masomo.	The authorities said that he was failing his classes and had missed many school days.
1753	They also called her an untalented wannabe actress and a whore.	Pia walimuita asiye na kipaji anayetaka kuwa maarufu na kahaba.	They also called him a lazy man who wanted to be famous and a liar.
1754	Her attorney filed copies of her academic transcript with the court to prove that she is not failing her classes  and thus the school transcripts became available for attorneys of Origo.	Wakili wake alifikisha nakala ya matokeo yake mahakamani na kuonesha kuwa hakuwa anafeli katika masomo yake na pia nakala hizo za matokeo walipewa mawakili wa Origo.	If you can't translate the sentence simply say you don't know.
1755	The outlet decided to publish data from her transcripts, claiming that Nagy almost failed history last term and is on the verge of failing in a few other subjects as well.	Chanzo hicho cha habari kiliamua kuchapisha taarifa kutoka katika ripoti ya matokeo ya Nagy na kusema kuwa alikaribia kufeli somo la Historia muhula uliopita na pia yupo katika hati hati ya kufeli masomo mengine pia.	The source decided to publish a report from the results report of Nagy and said that he was about to fail History last year and is also in a serious threat of failing other subjects.

1762	She and her attorney did not even think that Origo had the right to see the transcripts when they filed them in court.	Yeye na wakili wake wanadhani kuwa Origo hawakuwa na haki hata ya kuyaona matokeo yake walipoyawakilisha mahakamani.	He and his lawyer think that Origo had no right to see his results when he represented them in court.

"I would be astonished if that were true because in my family there was a history teacher among my grandparents,"" he continued."
1768	I think all this verbal aggression against me is very strange but I am no longer bothered by it.	Nadhani matukano yote haya dhidi yangu ni kitu cha ajabu sana ila sibabaiki tena.	I think all this abuse is very strange but I don't care anymore.

1770	The fact that Zsolt Bayer himself attacked me and the pro-government media is using false pretexts to try and smear me proves that, she added.	Ukweli ni kwamba kitendo cha Zsolt Bayer mwenyewe kunishambulia na vyombo vya habari vinavyounga serikali mkono kusambaza taarifa za uongo dhidi yangu, vinathibitisha hilo, aliongeza.

1781	Since mass protests against president Daniel Ortega erupted in Nicaragua in April 2018, the government has banned demonstrations, arrested thousands without trial, and shut down both alternative and mainstream media outlets.	Tangu maandamano makubwa dhidi ya Rais Daniel Ortega yalipuke nchini Nicaragua Aprili 2018, serikali imepiga marufuku maandamano, imewakamata maelfu bila kuwafungulia mashtaka na kufungia kwa pamoja vyanzo vikuu na vile mbadala vya habari.

The negotiations have failed, and the future of Nicaragua is still a difficult question.
1783	The demonstrations were originally against a social security reform that would raise income taxes while reducing pension benefits.	Maandamano yalianza kwa kupinga mabadiliko ya sera za mifuko ya hifadhi za jamii ambapo yangepandisha makato ya kodi ya mapato wakati ikipunguza maslahi ya kiinua mgongo.	The protests began by opposing the changes to the policies of the social security funds which would increase taxes on incomes while reducing benefits.
1784	The initial crackdown by the authorities paved the way for a nationwide call for the resignation of President Daniel Ortega and first lady and Vice-President Rosario Murillo.	Mwanzoni mchakato huo ulifanywa na mamlaka ulifungua mlango wa maandamano ya nchi nzima yakimtaka Rais Daniel Ortega, mkewe na Makamu wa Rais Rosario Murillo wajiuzulu.	The process was initiated by the government and opened the door for protests across the country calling for the resignation of President Daniel Ortega, his wife and the Vice President Rosario Murillo.
1785	Figures given for the protests death toll vary, and have not been updated since last year as barriers to documentation efforts increase.	Takwimu za vifo vilivyotokana na maandamano hayo yanapishana na hayajahuishwa tangu mwaka jana kwa sababu vikwazo dhidi ya uwekaji wa taarifa na kumbukumbu umeongezeka.
