ULinley Hebert, i-spokesman for the striking workers, uthe i-strike is a result of the government's failure to honor a 2012 agreement.
712	In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision, Hebert said.	“Ngenyanga kaOkuthowbha [kulo nyaka] urhulumente uye waphonononga imivuzo yabasebenzi bakarhulumente, kodwa asizange sibandakanywe kolo hlaziyo,” utshilo uHebert.	In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision, Hebert said.

Uhulumeni uthi ukungabikho kwemali yokukhupha ii-salary zeengcali zobulungisa eMalawi iminyaka idlulileyo kwenzeka ngenxa yeengxaki zezimali, emva kokungabikho kwemali evela kumazwe akhupha i-donor aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha i-aid evela kumazwe akhupha 
716	The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers.
