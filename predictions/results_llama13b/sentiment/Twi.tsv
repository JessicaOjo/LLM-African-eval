826	full time kotoko 20 liberty ⚽⚽ nea nyame tumi yɛ nie 🔴⚪💪⚽🙏	positive	"  The provided Twi statement has a positive sentiment. Here's the breakdown:

* ""Full time"" is a phrase commonly used to indicate that something is complete or final, which could be interpreted as positive.
* ""Kotoko"" is a name or nickname, so it doesn't contribute much to the overall sentiment.
* ""20 liberty"" is a phrase that suggests freedom or independence, which is generally considered a positive concept.
* ""Nya me nyame"" is a phrase that roughly translates to ""I don't know"", which can be neutral or negative depending on the context. However, in this case, it seems to be used as a humble expression rather than a negative one.
* ""Tumi yɛ nie"" is another phrase that means ""you are not here"", which could be interpreted as a mildly negative sentiment, but in this context, it might be more of an observation or a statement of fact.
* The emojis at the end (🔴⚪💪⚽🙏) all have positive connotations, with the exception of the last one (🙏), which is a prayer or supplication and could be seen as neutral.

Overall, the sentiment of the statement is positive.</s>"
