{{Negative}}

The statement uses language that objectifies and degrades women, reducing them to their physical appearance and body parts.

Additionally, the phrase ""لا تسمع سبا ولا شتما"" can be translated to ""don't listen to gossip or slander,"" but it is used here to silence and dismiss women's voices and experiences. Finally, the phrase ""أمام النساء بل يصل الأمر"" can be translated to ""in front of the women, let the matter be resolved,"" which suggests that women should not be involved in decision-making processes and that men should handle matters without their input. Overall, the statement perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and reinforces patriarchal attitudes towards women.</s>"
