For example, we might say ""These individuals are experts in their field, but they may feel uncomfortable discussing certain topics with people nearby."" This approach acknowledges the expertise of the individuals without perpetuating harmful stereotypes or language.</s>"

The statement you provided is in Portuguese and contains some food-related words and emojis. However, without further context, it's difficult for me to determine the sentiment of the statement.
