1923	wata shariar sai dai a lahira b komai idon kaima t ritsa d yan uwanka lokacin zaka ji abinda sauran talakawa suke ji a ransu	neutral	"  The Hausa statement you provided does not have a neutral, positive, or negative sentiment label. It is written in a complex form that combines multiple sentences and phrases, making it difficult to determine the overall sentiment of the statement without further context or interpretation.

However, I can suggest some possible interpretations based on my knowledge of Hausa language and culture:

* Wata shariar (water) + sai (bring) + dai (give) + a lahira (to the people) + b komai (and) + idon (do) + kaima (good deeds) + t ritsa (for the sake of) + d yan (God) + uwanka (reward) + lokacin (eternal) + zaka (life) + ji (if) + abinda (heaven) + sauran (enter) + talakawa (paradise) + suke (then) + ji (if) + a ransu (they will be rewarded).

This statement could be interpreted as a prayer or wish for eternal life and paradise, with the idea that doing good deeds and following God's commandments will lead to a reward in the afterlife. However, without more context or information about the speaker's intentions, it is difficult to provide a definitive interpretation of the sentiment of the statement.</s>"

* ""Hmmm"" is an expression of thought or consideration, which is neutral in tone.

* ""Kaima"" means ""to increase"" or ""to grow"", which is a neutral verb.
* ""Ya"" is a particle that indicates the subject of the sentence, and ""kulleka"" is the object of the verb, meaning ""your wealth"". So the phrase ""ya kulleka"" is neutral.
* ""Kamar"" means ""wealth"" or ""riches"", which has a positive connotation. However, the use of the word ""yanda"" (meaning ""increase"") with it makes the overall sentiment neutral.
* ""A kulle"" is a preposition indicating ""from"", and ""mu"" is a pronoun meaning ""you"". So the phrase ""mu dan bakar jaka"" is a polite way of saying ""from your wealth"", which is neutral.

Therefore, the entire statement has a neutral sentiment.</s>"
