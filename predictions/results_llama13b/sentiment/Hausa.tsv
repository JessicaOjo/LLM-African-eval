1923	wata shariar sai dai a lahira b komai idon kaima t ritsa d yan uwanka lokacin zaka ji abinda sauran talakawa suke ji a ransu	neutral	"  The Hausa statement you provided does not have a neutral, positive, or negative sentiment label. It is written in a complex form that combines multiple sentences and phrases, making it difficult to determine the overall sentiment of the statement without further context or interpretation.

However, I can suggest some possible interpretations based on my knowledge of Hausa language and culture:

* Wata shariar (water) + sai (bring) + dai (give) + a lahira (to the people) + b komai (and) + idon (do) + kaima (good deeds) + t ritsa (for the sake of) + d yan (God) + uwanka (reward) + lokacin (eternal) + zaka (life) + ji (if) + abinda (heaven) + sauran (enter) + talakawa (paradise) + suke (then) + ji (if) + a ransu (they will be rewarded).

This statement could be interpreted as a prayer or wish for eternal life and paradise, with the idea that doing good deeds and following God's commandments will lead to a reward in the afterlife. However, without more context or information about the speaker's intentions, it is difficult to provide a definitive interpretation of the sentiment of the statement.</s>"

* ""ku fada"" - This phrase means ""if"" in Hausa.

* ""Mu kawai hajiya"" is a polite way of addressing someone (the word ""mu"" means ""my"" in Hausa), so it adds a positive tone to the sentence.
* ""Rahama"" is a name, and ""kawai"" is another term of endearment, so these words don't contribute much to the overall sentiment of the sentence.
* ""K mbappe da angel di maria"" is a phrase that roughly translates to ""I will surely marry you,"" but it's not clear if this is meant literally or figuratively. Either way, it doesn't convey any strong negative or positive emotions.
* ""Suka cire mu a final din champions league"" is a nonsensical phrase that doesn't make sense in English or Hausa. It might be a typo or a language mistake, so I won't consider it when evaluating the sentiment of the sentence.

* ""Hmmm"" is an expression of thought or consideration, which is neutral in tone.
* ""Allah"" is a reference to God, which is generally considered positive but can also be used in a neutral context.
* ""Kaima"" means ""to increase"" or ""to grow"", which is a neutral verb.
* ""Ya"" is a particle that indicates the subject of the sentence, and ""kulleka"" is the object of the verb, meaning ""your wealth"". So the phrase ""ya kulleka"" is neutral.
* ""Kamar"" means ""wealth"" or ""riches"", which has a positive connotation. However, the use of the word ""yanda"" (meaning ""increase"") with it makes the overall sentiment neutral.
* ""A kulle"" is a preposition indicating ""from"", and ""mu"" is a pronoun meaning ""you"". So the phrase ""mu dan bakar jaka"" is a polite way of saying ""from your wealth"", which is neutral.

Therefore, the entire statement has a neutral sentiment.</s>"

The phrase ""gefen offishin donal trump"" is likely a reference to Donald Trump, but it is not clear what specific aspect of his presidency or persona is being referenced.
