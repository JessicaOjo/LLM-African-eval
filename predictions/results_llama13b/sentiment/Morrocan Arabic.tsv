* ""#SocialMediaNight"": This hashtag is neutral and simply indicates that the content is related to social media.
* ""HananeElKhader STP"": The name ""HananeElKhader"" is neutral, and ""STP"" likely stands for ""Social Media Platform,"" which is also neutral.

Based on the grammar and vocabulary used, here's my analysis:

Label: Neutral

The statement seems to be expressing a desire for a team (Olympique de Casa) to win a match against another team (Derby Bin Rac). The use of ""makanch"" (we hope) and ""lwydad"" (victory) suggest a positive tone, but the phrase ""differend lwydad"" (different victory) could potentially convey a sense of uncertainty or a lack of confidence in the team's ability to win. Overall, the sentiment of the statement is neutral rather than overtly positive or negative.</s>"

1157	@user 3lax manfdahxi hada howa li mhabl berkan hhhhhhhhhhhhh	negative	"  Hello! I'm here to assist you with any questions you may have. The statement you provided is written in Moroccan Arabic, but I'm afraid I cannot accurately determine the sentiment of the statement as it does not contain any clear emotional language or context that would indicate a positive, negative, or neutral tone.

However, I can suggest some possible ways to interpret the statement based on its grammar and vocabulary. ""@"" is often used in Arabic to address someone directly, so the statement could be interpreted as a direct address to the user. ""3lax"" could potentially be a misspelling of the word ""jallax,"" which means ""how are you?"" in Moroccan Arabic. ""manfdahxi"" is an unusual word that I couldn't find in my dictionary, so it might be a typo or a made-up word. Finally, ""li mhabl berkan"" could mean ""to speak clearly"" or ""to speak well.""

Without more context or information about the speaker's intentions, it's difficult for me to provide a definitive label for the sentiment of the statement. If you have any further questions or clarifications, please feel free to ask!</s>"

2275	لا نريد الاستقلاليين شفارة عاك اودي هاك. هاك ياسمينة. وغلاب اعودو بالله شفرووو حكهم......د	negative	"  The statement you provided is written in Moroccan Arabic and contains several expressions that may be difficult to understand for non-native speakers. However, based on the overall meaning of the sentence, I would label it as having a negative sentiment. Here's why:

The phrase ""لا نريد"" (laa nuryid) means ""we do not want,"" which already implies a negative sentiment. Additionally, the word ""استقلاليين"" (istiklalayin) refers to independence or autonomy, which is often associated with negative connotations in some contexts.

Furthermore, the use of the word ""شفارة"" (shafarah) to describe someone who is independent or autonomous can also be seen as derogatory or pejorative. This word is often used to refer to someone who is considered arrogant or selfish.

Overall, the statement seems to express disapproval or negativity towards people who value their independence or autonomy. Therefore, I would label its sentiment as negative.</s>"
