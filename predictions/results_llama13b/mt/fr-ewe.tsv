The phrase ""fin de cavale"" is French for ""end of the run,"" and it typically refers to the conclusion of a criminal's activities or the resolution of a legal case. In the context of the article you provided, ""fin de cavale"" likely refers to the end of a cybercriminal's activities or the capture of a cybercriminal.

1. ""Kpakpa-tsa"" - This word roughly translates to ""thief with technology"" and could be used to describe someone who uses technology to commit crimes.
2. ""Miwoho"" - This word means ""witchcraft"" or ""magic,"" and could be used metaphorically to describe the use of technology to deceive or manipulate others.
3. ""Gbevlo"" - This word means ""fraud"" or ""scam,"" and could be used to describe any type of fraudulent activity, including cybercrime.
