Malaria is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. The symptoms of malaria can begin within 2 to 3 days after infection, and can include fever, chills, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. In severe cases, malaria can cause anemia, seizures, coma, and even death.

To prevent malaria, it is important to take certain precautions when traveling to areas where the disease is common. These precautions include using insecticide-treated bed nets, wearing protective clothing, applying insect repellent, and avoiding outdoor activities during peak mosquito hours (usually at dawn and dusk). It is also recommended to take antimalarial medication before, during, and after travel to these areas.

If you suspect you may have been exposed to malaria or are experiencing symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. A healthcare professional will be able to diagnose malaria through a blood test and provide appropriate treatment. Treatment for malaria typically involves antimalarial medication, which can help clear the parasites from your body and alleviate symptoms. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary to ensure proper care and monitoring.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns!</s>"

The war you mentioned, the ""Front social-démocrate"" with Fru Ndi, refers to a conflict that took place in Cameroon during the late 20th century. The conflict was a series of political and military confrontations between the government of Cameroon, led by President Paul Biya, and the Social Democratic Front (FSD), a political party led by John Fru Ndi. The conflict began in the early 1990s and lasted for several years, resulting in significant loss of life and property, as well as displacement of many people.

Regarding the change in the nature of geopolitical wars in Cameroon after this conflict, it is important to note that the country has experienced various forms of violence and instability since then, including separatist movements in the English-speaking regions and Boko Haram insurgency in the north. These conflicts have resulted in significant humanitarian crises and have had far-reaching consequences for the stability and security of the region.</s>"
