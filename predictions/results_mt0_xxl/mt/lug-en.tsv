1420	Therefore, Bichisha seems to be referring to him.	Nolwekyo, Bichisha alabika okuba nga gw'ajulizaako.	<pad> So, Bichisha seems to be a questioner.</s>
1421	First, if these professional assassins knew Kayumba's house and had special keys to enter it, then why did they need Bichisha?

1423	Second, Bichisha's description of the shooting incident is suspicious.	Ekyokubiri, engeri Bichisha gy'annyonyolamu engeri amasasi gye gaakubwamu erimu okwekengera.	<pad> Second, the way Bichisha describes the shooting is very misleading.</s>
1424	He claims Mrs Kayumba later corroborated this story that a man approached their car as they left the mall and waved at them angrily to stop.

1428	The second reason is that the heroic story of Kayumba wrestling the assassin sounds like a Hollywood movie.	Ensonga ekyokubiri eri nti emboozi ya Kayumba ey'obuzira okulwana n'omutemu ewulikika nga ffirimu y'omu Hollywood.	<pad> The second reason is that Kayumba's speech about not fighting the attacker sounds like a Hollywood movie.</s>
1429	Is this really what happened or this is the version of events Kayumba, his wife and their driver wanted the world to hear?

1430	if Ndahiro wanted to kill Kayumba, would he telephone the General's driver whom he did not know and ask him to collaborate in the effort?	Bwe kiba nga Ndahiro yali ayagala kutta Kayumba, yandikubidde ddereeva wa Genero gwe yali tamanyi n'amusaba bakwatagane mu nsonga eno?	<pad> If Ndahiro wanted to kill Kayumba, why did he call the driver of General without knowing him and ask him to help him in this matter?</s>
